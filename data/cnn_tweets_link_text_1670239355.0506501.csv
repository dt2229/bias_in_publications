New car prices are finally coming down. But not by much

 — 
New car prices are finally coming down. A little, anyway.
Cars are still selling, on average, for more than the manufacturers’ sticker prices, but at least they’re closer, according to analysts. And a number of car brands are now selling for below sticker price, something that was once normal but that had become rare over the past year or more.
For the first six months of this year, new car prices averaged $700 over the manufacturer’s suggested retail price, or MSRP, according to Ivan Drury, an analyst with Edmunds.com. Over the past few months, though, prices have fallen to only about $230 over MSRP, on average, according to Edmunds.
Some car brands are still going for much more, though. Land Rover models, on average, still sell for $4,500 over sticker price while Kia models sell for about $1,600 over sticker price. Hondas are selling for about $1,360 over their suggested retail price, on average, according to data from Edmunds.com.

In general, buyers shopping for mainstream, non-luxury vehicles tend to pay more over sticker than luxury car buyers, according to analysts at Cox Automotive. While luxury car buyers, who make up about 17% of the market, still pay higher prices, overall – $66,000 compared to an average of $44,000 for non-luxury brands – they were, at least, paying closer to sticker. The slight difference in price mark-ups may reflect the fact that non-luxury cars, in many cases, have appointments and features similar to those in luxury cars, said Cox spokesman Mark Schirmer. Dealers are now simply demanding that customers pay for what the product actually provides rather than a lower price the manufacturer has dictated. He added that luxury car dealers may place more value on the customer’s experience and, so, be less aggressive on pricing than mainstream dealers.
Overall, Cox’s auto pricing analysts show buyers paying $527 over sticker on average. That’s higher than what Edmunds claims but, again, lower than earlier in the year. (The difference has to do with methods of analysis and specific data sources, according to spokespeople for both companies.)
Dealerships asking customers to pay over sticker price for a car is normally considered unusual, something only done for particularly desirable or hard-to-find models like high-performance sports cars. For the past 17 months, though, according to Cox Automotive, vehicle inventory shortages have enabled car dealers to push prices above MSRP. Unlike most things, car prices are usually individually negotiated by dealers leading to broad price flexibility. Manufacturing slowdowns caused by supply chain problems – car companies have had trouble getting some parts, like computer chips – have meant few cars are available to sell and that’s given car dealers enormous negotiating power.
Some manufacturers, like Ford and Honda, have noticed customers’ willingness to deal with low inventories, higher prices, and longer wait times to get their vehicles. Executives from those companies have said they don’t plan to ever go back the days when dealer lots were filled with cars and SUVs waiting to be sold.
While still tight, especially for some manufacturers like Honda, vehicle inventories are at their highest since June of 2021, according to Cox.
“If consumers are flexible on make and model, it will be possible to find a good deal at year-end sales events,” said Rebecca Rydzewski, for Cox Automotive.
Some big SUVs like the Lincoln Navigator and Volvo XC90 are selling for relatively large discounts of $1,400 and $1,900 below sticker, on average, according to Edmunds. Volvo and Lincoln, in general, are the two car brands offering the biggest discounts from MSRP, according to data from Edmunds. Buick is another brand offering fairly big discounts, according to Cox.
Kia, once the 'value' brand, now has the biggest price markups
In terms of new car loans, customers can now get fairly good interest rates on shorter-term loans of 36 to 48 months, said Drury. Those shorter loan terms result in higher monthly payments, of course, but with the benefit that buyers can save thousands of dollars in interest, especially with rising interest rates. The Federal Reserve is expected to continue raising its benchmark rate which can, in turn, push up interest rates on things like auto loans. An individual’s own credit rating has the biggest impact on how much auto lenders charge, but there are still good financing deals for the well qualified. according to Bankrate.com. Offers of 0% interest rates have increased sharply at the beginning of this month, according to a report from Cox Automotive.
Used car prices are also starting to come down a bit, something that could prod new car shoppers back into the market, said Drury.
“Consumers who have been waiting on the sidelines watching their trade-in appreciate will now start to feel the need to act if they want to extract maximum trade-in value from their vehicle,” he said.
With inflation and high gas prices, owners of cheaper, fuel-efficient models will get the best values for their trade-ins, Cox Automotive analyst Brian Finkelmeyer wrote in a recent report. Those trading in bigger, more expensive vehicles could be disappointed, though.
“Used-car inventories across the country are currently bloated with expensive used merchandise priced over $35,000,” he wrote.
It will be a long wait before shopping returns to the way it used to be, with buyers able to negotiate steep discounts on most vehicles, said Edmunds’ Drury. That won’t start happening until the end of 2023 or even into 2024, he said.

 — 
Looks like Thanksgiving will be a lot pricier this year.
Market research firm IRI predicts that your Thanksgiving meal will cost about 13.5% more compared to last year, based on how retail prices in the four weeks through October 16 compared to the same period in 2021. IRI measures items including turkey and other meat, baking essentials, beverages and popular side dishes in its list of Thanksgiving foods.
Even if retailers offer promotions in the weeks or days leading up to the holiday, those prices will still likely be higher than in the same period a year ago, said Alastair Steel, executive of IRI Client Engagement.
“Promotions could swing the number a little, but I don’t expect [them] to swing it in a meaningful way,” he told CNN Business. “If anything, there are slightly less promotions,” this year, he added, because manufactures have been increasing prices as their own costs rise.

It’s no surprise that Thanksgiving is expected to be more expensive this year given how high grocery prices have been in general. Extreme weather conditions such as drought and diseases, including the highly contagious avian flu, among other factors, have contributed to stubbornly high food inflation. In the year through September, not adjusted for seasonal shifts, grocery prices shot up 13%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Shoppers know what’s coming. About 38% of consumers are expecting to pay more for Thanksgiving meals this year, even though they’re planning to buy the same amount of food, according to an IRI survey conducted in September.
There could still be some relief in the grocery aisle, however. Discount retailers like Aldi and Lidl have promised low prices on some Thanksgiving favorites this year.
Aldi said it would lower some prices to 2019 levels, and Lidl said that its typical Thanksgiving basket, including frozen turkey, fresh cranberries, sweet potatoes and more, will cost under $30 and feed 10 people, while supplies last. Discount retailers have picked up new customers as inflation has risen.

 — 
In 2019, Air Company made a splash when it launched vodka derived from recaptured carbon, in an effort to reduce the amount of the harmful greenhouse gas in the atmosphere.
Today, the Brooklyn-based startup has begun using the same process to make fuel for airplanes.
Air Company’s sustainable aviation fuel, which was recently tested by the US Air Force, could ultimately help the airline industry hit its goal of net zero carbon emissions by 2050. Currently, the airline industry accounts for about 3% of total global carbon emissions each year, and mostly relies on traditional, fossil-based fuels that require various forms of environmental disruption to produce.
Gravity could solve renewable energy's biggest problem
Already, some of the world’s biggest airlines are signing on to Air Company’s vision. The company announced last month that Jet Blue and Virgin Atlantic, as well as startup aircraft company Boom Supersonic, have agreed to purchase millions of gallons of its fuel in the coming years. Jet Blue Ventures, the airline’s investment arm, also invested directly in Air Company’s $30 million Series A funding round earlier this year.
Air Company's carbon-neutral, CO2-derived fuel was successfully used in August 2022 during a test flight in partnership with the US Air Force.
Air Company
“How we think about what the company does is trying to solve humanity’s toughest problems,” Gregory Constantine, co-founder and CEO of Air Company, told CNN in an interview last month. “For us, climate change is the greatest challenge that we’re facing as humanity to date … so if we can work on technologies that take what was once really thought of as a problem and turn it into a solution, then that’s a massive win.”
A number of producers of sustainable aviation fuel have emerged in recent years, including a major Finnish producer called Neste, many of them using ingredients such as plant material and cooking oil. But Air Company’s production process starts by pulling harmful carbon emissions out of the air.
The company first harvests carbon, mostly from industrial settings such as biofuel production facilities. It then takes water, separates the hydrogen from the oxygen, and blends the captured carbon with the hydrogen and a proprietary mix of other compounds, according to Air Company CTO Stafford Sheehan. It then distills that solution down, using what looks like a larger version of, say, a whiskey distilling system. The final products are ethyl alcohol, which is used to make the company’s vodka and other products such as perfume, as well as paraffin, which forms the basis of its jet fuel.
These 'flying' ferries could get you to work in half the time
In some ways, Sheehan said, the process mimics how plants work: It takes in carbon, and aside from the final products, the only other offput is oxygen. And the company says its tests have indicated that planes should be able to fly using its fuel without blending it with fossil-based fuels or modifying their engines.
By the time a plane has flown using Air Company’s fuel, it will have released the same amount of carbon dioxide back into the atmosphere as was captured to make the fuel, meaning the process on the whole is carbon-neutral, Sheehan said. The company uses renewable energy sources like solar to power its production facility.
Air Company does still have some work to do until its carbon-derived fuel is ready to be used widely on commercial flights. It needs more testing, and it needs to grow its manufacturing footprint. Sheehan said the company’s next production facility is already in the works and will be about 100 times the size of its Brooklyn test facility, which is probably about the size of a two-bedroom New York City apartment.
Air Company was founded in 2019 by Gregory Constantine and Dr. Stafford Sheehan.
Air Company
The company will also need to bring down the cost of its fuel, which is currently more expensive than traditional jet fuels, although the company declined to provide details on just how much. Air Company said that “consumers will not feel the impact of this shift,” and added that lowering the cost will be achieved in part “through an array of government incentives made available to fuel producers generating sustainable alternatives.”
Constantine said the company is planning for the first test of its fuel on a commercial plane next year, and expects to have its fuel used on its first commercial passenger flight by 2024.
Still, Air Company is hopeful that its efforts could eventually disrupt the aviation industry for the better, just as it’s been working to do with its consumer goods.
“Aviation has been a part of the goal since the start,” he said. “However, to get to those, you know, large industrial markets like aviation fuel, which it is traditionally known as the hottest industry industries to decarbonize, is going to take time. It’s going to take a lot of money and a lot of effort.”

“How we think about what the company does is trying to solve humanity’s toughest problems,” Gregory Constantine, co-founder and CEO of Air Company, told CNN in an interview last month. “For us, climate change is the greatest challenge that we’re facing as humanity to date … so if we can work on technologies that take what was once really thought of as a problem and turn it into a solution, then that’s a massive win.”
A number of producers of sustainable aviation fuel have emerged in recent years, including a major Finnish producer called Neste, many of them using ingredients such as plant material and cooking oil. But Air Company’s production process starts by pulling harmful carbon emissions out of the air.
The company first harvests carbon, mostly from industrial settings such as biofuel production facilities. It then takes water, separates the hydrogen from the oxygen, and blends the captured carbon with the hydrogen and a proprietary mix of other compounds, according to Air Company CTO Stafford Sheehan. It then distills that solution down, using what looks like a larger version of, say, a whiskey distilling system. The final products are ethyl alcohol, which is used to make the company’s vodka and other products such as perfume, as well as paraffin, which forms the basis of its jet fuel.
These 'flying' ferries could get you to work in half the time
In some ways, Sheehan said, the process mimics how plants work: It takes in carbon, and aside from the final products, the only other offput is oxygen. And the company says its tests have indicated that planes should be able to fly using its fuel without blending it with fossil-based fuels or modifying their engines.
By the time a plane has flown using Air Company’s fuel, it will have released the same amount of carbon dioxide back into the atmosphere as was captured to make the fuel, meaning the process on the whole is carbon-neutral, Sheehan said. The company uses renewable energy sources like solar to power its production facility.
Air Company does still have some work to do until its carbon-derived fuel is ready to be used widely on commercial flights. It needs more testing, and it needs to grow its manufacturing footprint. Sheehan said the company’s next production facility is already in the works and will be about 100 times the size of its Brooklyn test facility, which is probably about the size of a two-bedroom New York City apartment.
Air Company was founded in 2019 by Gregory Constantine and Dr. Stafford Sheehan.
Air Company
The company will also need to bring down the cost of its fuel, which is currently more expensive than traditional jet fuels, although the company declined to provide details on just how much. Air Company said that “consumers will not feel the impact of this shift,” and added that lowering the cost will be achieved in part “through an array of government incentives made available to fuel producers generating sustainable alternatives.”
Constantine said the company is planning for the first test of its fuel on a commercial plane next year, and expects to have its fuel used on its first commercial passenger flight by 2024.
Still, Air Company is hopeful that its efforts could eventually disrupt the aviation industry for the better, just as it’s been working to do with its consumer goods.
“Aviation has been a part of the goal since the start,” he said. “However, to get to those, you know, large industrial markets like aviation fuel, which it is traditionally known as the hottest industry industries to decarbonize, is going to take time. It’s going to take a lot of money and a lot of effort.”

Amarachi Orie, CNN
King Charles III has unveiled the first statue of his late mother Queen Elizabeth II since her death in September.
The new sculpture in the English city of York was revealed on Wednesday outside York Minster, the largest gothic cathedral in Britain, and pays tribute to the late monarch's life of service and dedication.

""When this statue was first planned five years ago, during a reign of unprecedented duration and achievement, it was intended as a celebration of the late Queen's Platinum Jubilee,"" the King said in a speech at a rainy unveiling ceremony while holding a black umbrella.

""Now, as we have witnessed, with great sadness, the passing of that reign, it is unveiled in her memory, as a tribute to a life of extraordinary service and devotion,"" he continued.
""The late Queen was always vigilant for the welfare of her people during her life. Now, her image will watch over what will become Queen Elizabeth Square for centuries to come,"" he added, before pulling down the purple cloth covering the towering statue, which overlooks York's new public square from above one of the cathedral's entrances.

Ahead of the unveiling, Archbishop of York Stephen Cottrell described the ""unique occasion"" as an ""immensely poignant moment"" honoring ""the long life and service of Her Late Majesty Queen Elizabeth to her people, her nation and the Commonwealth.""

The Queen died aged 96 on September 8, just months after celebrating an unprecedented seven decades on the throne.
Her commemorative statue, which was designed and carved by York Minster stonemason Richard Bossons, stands at just over six and a half feet tall and weighs around 4,000 pounds.

The French limestone sculpture shows the late Queen in Garter robes, crowned with the George IV State Diadem, and holding the orb and scepter -- symbols of her role as head of church and state.
""She will stand proud and resolute in her niche, welcoming worshippers and visitors alike,"" said Bossons in a statement.
A blemished arrival
Earlier Wednesday, a 23-year-old man was arrested ""on a suspicion of a public order offence"" after eggs were thrown at the King and Queen Consort during their visit to York, according to North Yorkshire police.

The man has been interviewed and released on police bail, the force said in an update on Thursday.

Donald Trump believes we should terminate “all rules, regulations and articles, even those found in the Constitution” to overturn the 2020 election. That was his view on 1/6 and remains his view today. No honest person can now deny that Trump is an enemy of the Constitution.

Harvard museum will return Native American hair samples, apologizes for ‘complicity’ in objectification of Native peoples
By Rob Frehse, CNN
Published 10:44 PM EST, Thu November 10, 2022

 — 
A Harvard University museum apologized Thursday for its “complicity” in the objectification of Native peoples and will return hair clippings of about 700 Native American children who were forced to attend United States boarding schools in the 1930’s.
“The Peabody Museum apologizes to Indigenous families and tribal nations for our complicity in the objectification of Native peoples and for our more than 80-year possession of hair taken from their relatives,” the museum said in a statement.
Native American children were renamed, told not to use indigenous languages and had their hair cut at more than 400 boarding schools in the United States that forced assimilation in the 19th and 20th centuries, according to the Department of Interior.
In May, the department released a long-awaited review of past efforts by the federal government to assimilate Native American children into White American society by separating them from their families and stripping them of their languages and cultures.
Interior Department says Native American children were forced into assimilation at 408 federal boarding schools
On Thursday, the museum said it recognizes the cultural and spiritual significance that hair holds for many Native American communities and is “fully committed” to return the hair to tribal communities and families.
“Between 1930-1933, anthropologist George Edward Woodbury, Curator of the State Historical Society of Colorado, was researching potential connections between Indigenous communities to study human variation and support early anthropological theories around the peopling of North America,” according to the museum.
The nearly 1,500 hair clippings were mostly taken from living people in Asia, Central America, North America, Oceania and South America, the museum said.
Woodbury and his wife published a paper on the topic in 1932, according to the museum. In 1935, Woodbury came to Harvard and served as a lecturer and research fellow in Anthropology and in 1938, he left the university and the discipline of anthropology. The collection of hair samples remained at the Peabody, the museum said.
Harvard noted that anthropologists and others have researched human hair variations for several centuries and that many of those hair sample collections are at museums and other institutions.
What Indigenous Peoples' Day means to Native Americans
“Much of this work was carried out to support, directly or indirectly, scientific racism,” the museum said. “Descriptions and measurements of hair types were used to justify racial categories and hierarchies.”
The museum set up a website listing tribal affiliations and the sites where the hair was collected in the United States to help “support the reconnection of families and tribal nations with their relatives to facilitate the process of healing.”
The National Native American Boarding School Healing Coalition reacted to the museum’s decision in a post on social media.
“While we recognize that the Peabody Museum’s apology and commitment to returning these materials back to their relatives and Tribal Nations is an essential first step, we need to see meaningful, urgent, and ongoing responses to the extractive and dehumanizing collections practices so commonly seen in anthropological, archaeological, and museum sciences.”

A Texas woman found guilty of killing a pregnant woman to take her unborn child has been sentenced to death
By Rebekah Riess, CNN
Updated 9:59 AM EST, Fri November 11, 2022
Taylor Rene Parker was found guilty of capital murder for killing a woman and taking her baby, who also died.
Bi-State Detention Center/AP
CNN
 — 
A Texas woman convicted of killing a pregnant woman and then taking her unborn baby, who also died, has been sentenced to death, court records show.
A Bowie County jury last month after about an hour of deliberations found Taylor Rene Parker guilty of capital murder in the deaths of Reagan Michelle Simmons and her baby, the district attorney’s office previously said. The same jury was then tasked with choosing her sentence – death or prison without parole.
The jury handed down the death sentence Wednesday, online court records show.
“Based on the strong defense case we put on at sentencing, we are disappointed in the verdict, but we respect the jury’s findings after a long, factually and emotionally difficult trial,” Parker’s attorney, Jeff Harrelson, said.
With her death sentence, Parker becomes one of just seven women on Texas’ death row, according to statistics from the Texas Department of Criminal Justice.
According to a probable cause affidavit, Parker had told her boyfriend and others she was pregnant, held a gender reveal party and on October 9, 2020, said she was going to a hospital in Idabel, Oklahoma, to preregister for labor to be induced.
Jury finds Texas woman guilty of killing pregnant woman to take her unborn child
That same morning, police in New Boston, Texas, west of Texarkana, received a 911 call from a woman who reported someone had killed her daughter, the affidavit said. Responding officers found Simmons, who they learned had been 34 weeks pregnant, with a large cut along her abdomen and the baby no longer in her womb.
Texas state troopers conducted a traffic stop of a car that morning and found Parker holding a baby in her lap and “the umbilical cord was connected to the infant, which appeared to be coming out of the female’s pants, as if she gave birth to the child,” the affidavit said.
Parker and the baby were taken to the hospital in Idabel, where hospital staff determined Parker had not given birth to the child. Parker then admitted to being in a “physical altercation” with the victim and abducting the unborn baby from the victim’s body.
Authorities determined Parker caused the deaths of both Simmons and her baby “due to the inability to provide necessary care to the child,” the affidavit said.
“We are just so thankful justice has been served today, for not only our family, our friends, the prosecution team, our community,” Jessica Brooks, the mother of the victim, told CNN affiliate KSLA, which reported the sentencing trial lasted 25 days and included 142 witnesses.
According to the station, prosecutors argued for death, saying Parker would not change, while the defense, in seeking the provide jurors with context from Parker’s life, said she had traumatic issues that had not been addressed.
“I’m overwhelmed with happiness it’s over,” the victim’s sister Emily Simmons said, per KSLA, “because (Parker) has been such a burden in our life for so long now that I haven’t been able to think about my sister without thinking about her.”

One of nature’s great mysteries may now have an answer, according to new ‘fairy circle’ study
By Taylor Nicioli, CNN
Published 7:29 PM EST, Thu November 10, 2022
Called fairy circles, these unusual circular patches of barren land that form patterns in the Namib Desert have a whimsical name, but no mythical beings are at play here.

 — 
For over 50 years, ecologists have studied and debated the mystery of the Namib Desert’s “fairy circles,” circular patches, mostly barren of grass, that have spread across 1,100 miles in the arid grasslands of Southern Africa.
Despite their whimsical name, akin to the term “fairy rings” for circular patterns of fungi found in forested areas, there are no fairies at play here. Many theories have been put forth, but two have held the most merit. One theory has looked to blame termites for these dry patches, while the other considers the grasses’ evolution. Scientists have gone back and forth for decades, but a new study offers what may finally be evidence for a clear explanation.

Stephan Getzin, an ecologist at the University of Göttingen in Germany and lead author of the study, began his research on the fairy circles in 2000. In the years since, he has published more papers on the circles, and their origins, than any other expert.
What makes the fairy circles distinctive are the barren patches within them, but the growth of grasses around them is notable as well — they have found a way to thrive in what is considered one of the driest places in the world. In previous research, Getzin and his team hypothesized that plants in the circles’ outer rings had evolved to maximize their limited water in the desert.

And for the past three years, he has spent time in Namibia tracking the growth of the grasses to find more evidence for this theory. During the drought season of 2020, Getzin and his team of researchers installed sensors that could record the moisture of the soil at around 7.9 inches (20 centimeters) deep — and monitor the grasses’ water uptake.
“We were really lucky, because in 2020 there was not much vegetation, or actually, almost any grass vegetation in the fairy circle area,” Getzin said. “But in 2021, and this year, in 2022, there was a very good rainfall season, so we could actually really follow how the growth of the new grasses was redistributing the soil water.”

Analyzing the data from these rainfall seasons, Getzin’s team found water from within the circles was depleting fast, despite not having any grass to use it, while the grasses on the outside were as robust as ever. Under the strong heat in the desert, these well-established grasses had evolved to create a vacuum system around their roots that drew any water toward them, according to Getzin. The grasses from within the circles, which attempt to grow right after rainfall, meanwhile, were unable to receive enough water to live.

“A circle is the most logical geometric formation which you would create as a plant suffering from lack of water,” Getzin said. “If these circles were squares, or low, complex structures, then you would have a lot more individual grasses along the circumference. … The proportional area is smaller than if you grow in a circle. These grasses end up in a circle because that’s the most logical structure to maximize the water available to each individual plant.”
The study called this an example of “ecohydrological feedback,” in which the barren circles become reservoirs that help sustain grasses at the edges — though at the expense of grasses in the middle. This self-organization is used to buffer against the negative effects of increasing aridity, Getzin said, and is also seen in other harsh drylands in the world.
In response to the ‘termite theory’
The termite hypothesis, meanwhile, suggested that fairy circles are generated by sand termites that damage grass roots, and was well received among other scientists. However, a 2016 study of similar fairy circles in Australia found no clear links to the pests. Getzin’s latest research came to similar conclusions.
“We have an example where it rained only once, the grasses came up, and then after eight or nine days, the grasses only within the fairy circles had started dying,” Getzin said. “When we (excavated) these grasses carefully and looked at the roots, none of these grasses had any root damage by termites — but still, they died. Our results clearly state, no, these grasses die without termites.”
Twelve continuously recording soil-moisture sensors, installed at regular intervals at a 20-centimeter depth, track a section of the desert connecting two fairy circles.

Getzin and his team also found the roots from young plants within the circles to be longer than those on the outside. This suggests, according to Getzin, that the grasses had created longer routes in an attempt to find water — further evidence of their competition with the outside ring’s grasses in the water-scarce desert.
While the evidence brought forth from the study is a step forward, scientists — Getzin included — believe there is still more research that could be done. That said, Getzin told CNN that it’s time for him to move on to a new challenge.

“With the fairy circles in Namibia, as well as those seen in Australia, the plants are modifying the soil moisture distribution and thereby increasing their survival chances, and we can call this sort of ‘swarm intelligence,’” Getzin said. “Plants do make intelligent patterns and geometric formations, and I will continue to work in this direction.”
Near the fairy circle area in Namibia, for example, researchers have also found a different species of grass forming in large, circular rings after rainfall. “It’s a completely different grass genus, but it forms identical circular formations,” Getzin said. He is looking to research this process during Namibia’s next rainy season of 2023.

Space Shuttle Challenger remnants discovered underwater by documentary crew

 — 
Explorers trudged the Atlantic Ocean searching for World War II artifacts lost at sea, but they stumbled on something else — a 20-foot-long piece of debris from the Space Shuttle Challenger, which was destroyed shortly after takeoff in 1986.
The History Channel and NASA revealed Thursday that the Challenger segment was discovered off Florida’s east coast during the filming of a new series called “The Bermuda Triangle: Into Cursed Waters.” The series is set to premiere this month on the History Channel.
The Challenger broke apart after its launch on January 28, 1986, killing all seven crew members aboard, including a teacher was set to become the first civilian in space. TV viewers, especially students in schools across the US, watched a live broadcast of the blast in horror that morning.
“NASA currently is considering what additional actions it may take regarding the artifact that will properly honor the legacy of Challenger’s fallen astronauts and the families who loved them,” the space agency said in a news release.
Mike Barnette, an underwater explorer who led the crew that found the shuttle artifact, remembers watching the tragedy on TV in his high school classroom. He called it “sobering” to realize that his team found a scrap from the spacecraft — the first debris to be discovered since pieces from the shuttle washed ashore in 1996.
Rare photos show the early years of NASA's space shuttle era
“I can almost smell the smells of that day,” Barnette told CNN in a phone interview Thursday, referring to the day the Challenger exploded. “It was just so burned into my brain.”
Barnette and his team of investigators set off in March to search suspected shipwreck sites in the Bermuda Triangle, a swath of the northern Atlantic Ocean said to be the site of dozens of shipwrecks and plane crashes. The team also set its sights on one area outside the triangle, just off Florida’s Space Coast, where NASA has launched rockets since its inception.
The team was searching for a WWII-era rescue plane that mysteriously disappeared in December 1945, but a more modern object partially covered by sand on the seafloor sparked interest and further investigation from the dive team, according to the History Channel.
During the first dive, Barnette said a storm caused the water to turn so murky it was like swimming in Guinness beer. “We had terrible visibility,” he said.
The divers carried out a second excursion in May and finally captured clear footage of the wreckage. They brought evidence of their discovery to retired NASA astronaut Bruce Melnick, a longtime friend of Barnette’s, who immediately suggested it could be detritus from the Challenger disaster.
Distinctive square tiles from the Challenger tipped the explorers off, suggesting they had uncovered a large chunk of the orbiter’s underbelly. The underbelly was coated in thousands of silicon tiles protecting the shuttle from heat as it returned into the Earth’s atmosphere from space.
The team turned its findings over to NASA in August, and the space agency recently confirmed the origins of the debris after reviewing footage from the dive, according to a news release.
The final Challenger mission was set to carry seven people into space — NASA astronauts Francis “Dick” Scobee, Michael Smith, Ronald McNair, Ellison Onizuka, Judith Resnik and Gregory Jarvis as well as Christa McAuliffe, a New Hampshire schoolteacher who was set to become the first citizen space shuttle passenger as part of a new NASA program.
NASA's Artemis I mission delayed again as storm barrels toward launch site
But 73 seconds after takeoff from its Florida launch site, the Challenger exploded, killing everyone on board. A NASA investigation later revealed a rubber “O-ring” seal on one of Challenger’s solid rocket boosters had failed because it was exposed to unusually low temperatures while the space shuttle sat on the launchpad. It caused a leak of highly explosive gases, which ultimately led to the catastrophic explosion.
“While it has been nearly 37 years since seven daring and brave explorers lost their lives aboard Challenger, this tragedy will forever be seared in the collective memory of our country. For millions around the globe, myself included, Jan. 28, 1986, still feels like yesterday,” NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said in a statement.
“This discovery gives us an opportunity to pause once again, to uplift the legacies of the seven pioneers we lost, and to reflect on how this tragedy changed us. At NASA, the core value of safety is — and must forever remain — our top priority, especially as our missions explore more of the cosmos than ever before.”
The six-part series “The Bermuda Triangle: Into Cursed Waters” premieres at 10 p.m. ET on November 22 on the History Channel.

Novak Djokovic leaves no stone unturned in pursuit of greatness, but secrecy with drink mixture draws scrutiny
By Matias Grez, CNN
Updated 11:42 AM EST, Thu November 10, 2022

 — 
In his pursuit of greatness, it has been well documented that Novak Djokovic has left no stone unturned.
From changing his diet to incorporating meditation into his training, the Serb is constantly trying to find that extra edge to improve his chances on the tennis court.
His latest efforts, however, have drawn criticism.
In a video posted on social media, Djokovic’s physio Ulises Badio is seen preparing a drink in the stands during Saturday’s semifinal win over Stefanos Tsitsipas at the Paris Masters.

Badio is then shielded by two other men as he finishes preparing the drink, before handing it to a ball girl to pass onto Djokovic.
The incident has been described as looking “amazingly dodgy” and “bizarre” by two journalists on Twitter.
However, Djokovic’s wife Jelena has launched a vigorous defense of the 21-time grand slam champion on social media.
“I don’t see anything dodgy,” Jelena Djokovic wrote in one reply. “In fact, I see people trying to be private about their business in a world where everyone feels like they have every right to point a camera at you whenever they want.
“Apparently, wanting/trying to be private makes you dodgy nowadays.”
“Sit a bit in silence’
In one Twitter interaction, a user suggested Djokovic hire a PR agency to help avoid these types of backlash, an idea which was given short shrift from the tennis star’s wife.
“He will talk when he is ready to talk,” Jelena replied. “This whole nonsense about making people speak about something they are not ready because OTHERS are unpatient (sic) is absurd.
“Sit a bit in silence. Mind yourself more. Not everything you see is controversial. It could be private. Is that allowed?”
Djokovic was eventually defeated by unseeded Danish teenager Holger Rune 3-6 6-3 7-5 in the final of the Paris Masters.

It’s not the first time Djokovic has drawn curiosity over a drinks bottle.
During his victorious Wimbledon run earlier this year, Djokovic was seen inhaling from a drinks bottle. When questioned about it in the post-match press conference, the world No. 8 laughed it off and said it was a “magic potion.”
“It’s going to come out as one of the supplement, let’s say, lines that I’m doing right now with drink and a few other things,” he said.
“You’ll try it and you’ll let me know how it feels. You might win Wimbledon.”
Australian Open participation
With January’s Australian Open fast approaching, it remains unclear whether Djokovic, who is unvaccinated against Covid-19, will be able to compete.
He is currently banned from re-entering the country until 2025 after being deported before the start of the tournament earlier this year.
Last month, Tennis Australia boss Craig Tiley said he would not try to convince the Australian government to allow Djokovic to compete in the tournament.

“At this point, Novak and the federal government need to work out the situation and then we’ll follow any instruction after that,” Tiley told reporters.
“It’s not a matter we can lobby on. It’s a matter that definitely stays between the two of them and then depending on the outcome of that we would welcome him to the Australian Open.
“(Djokovic) said that he’d obviously love to come back to Australia, but he knows it’s going to be an ultimate decision for the federal government.
“He’s accepted that position. It’s a private matter between them but we’d like to welcome Novak back – he’s a nine-time champion – provided he gets the right entry requirements into Australia.”

Get free entry to all US National Park sites on Friday
Forrest Brown, CNN • Published 10th November 2022
Facebook
Twitter
Email
(CNN) — The US National Park Service offers free entry a handful of times each year to all of its more than 400 sites. We're at the last one for 2022.
No fees will be charged to enter any site -- including the marquee names -- on Friday, November 11.
The NPS chose Veterans Day for the last free-entry day to honor the people who have served in the military.
If you wish to commemorate veterans or learn more about US history in general while saving some money, you have have plenty of sites from which to choose, including:
• Antietam National Battlefield in Maryland
• Chickamauga & Chattanooga National Military Park in Georgia and Tennessee
• Fort Davis National Historic Site in Texas
• Fort McHenry National Monument and Historic Shrine in Maryland
• Fort Vancouver National Historic Site in Oregon and Washington
• Golden Spike National Historic Park in Utah
• Perry's Victory and International Peace Memorial in Ohio
• Vicksburg National Military Park in Mississippi
Click here for a full listing of every NPS site, which it calls ""units.""
Most NPS sites are free all year anyway. Only 108 charge a fee. And as you'd suspect, it's mostly the big names that ask you to pay to enter: Places such as Arches in Utah, Rocky Mountain in Colorado and Shenandoah in Virginia.
But they're all free this Friday.
One catch: ""The entrance fee waiver for fee-free days does not cover amenity or user fees for activities such as camping, boat launches, transportation or special tours,"" the NPS says.
Planning pays off
A light autumn snow comes to Yosemite National Park in California. Things can get much deeper there.

If you're not much of a planner, it might be a good idea to develop the habit -- particularly if you want to see a popular NPS site on a free day.
Of those 420+ sites in the National Park System, the top 25 got more than half of the system's total number of visits last year. Some parks set all-time records for visitors in 2021.

If you have a particular site you wish to visit, make sure to check its website first. For instance, popular Yosemite National Park in California's Sierra Nevada mountains can be open in November, but unpredictable autumn snows can cause short-term closures.

Judge scorches and sanctions Trump lawyers for lawsuit against Hillary Clinton and Democrats
By Kara Scannell
Updated 11:22 AM EST, Fri November 11, 2022

CNN
 — 
A federal judge on Thursday ordered sanctions against attorneys for former President Donald Trump in his failed lawsuit against Hillary Clinton, the Democratic National Committee and numerous others that he claimed conspired to undermine the 2016 presidential election.
Judge Donald Middlebrooks ordered Trump lawyers Alina Habba, Michael Madaio, Peter Ticktin, Jamie Alan Sasson and their law firms to pay $50,000 in penalties to the court and $16,274.23 in legal fees to Charles Dolan, one of more than two dozen people or entities named as defendants in the lawsuit.
Trump, New York AG both propose retired judge to serve as monitor of Trump Org.
Middlebrooks, who previously dismissed the lawsuit, calling it a “two-hundred page political manifesto,” said the attorneys ignored warnings from Dolan, a volunteer on the Clinton campaign, and his attorney that their facts were wrong, including basic information such as where he lived.
“The pleadings in this case contained factual allegations that were either knowingly false or made in reckless disregard for the truth,” Middlebrooks wrote.
“Not just initiated by a shotgun pleading, this was a shotgun lawsuit. Thirty-one individuals and organizations were summoned to court, forced to hire lawyers to defend against frivolous claims,” the judge wrote. “The only common thread against them was Mr. Trump’s animus.”
Middlebrooks added: “Plaintiff deliberately misrepresented public documents by selectively using some portions while omitting other information including findings and conclusions that contradicted his narrative. … It was too frequent to be accidental. Every claim was frivolous, most barred by settled, well-established existing law. These were political grievances masquerading as legal claims.”
“This cannot be attributed to incompetent lawyering,” he wrote. “It was a deliberate use of the judicial system to pursue a political agenda.”
Dolan’s lawyer, George Doumar, praised the ruling. “Trying to use the courts for political purposes undermines the foundations of our court system, I think that’s the message being sent. That message applies to lawyers and to clients,” Doumar said.

“We gave Trump’s lawyers multiple warnings, and rather than heed the warnings and serve as gatekeepers of the integrity of the court system as lawyers are supposed to do, they doubled down on unsupported allegations and apparently chose not to tell their client that he was so wrong that they couldn’t go forward,” Doumar added.
“It should be no surprise that we will be appealing this decision,” Habba said in a statement following the ruling.
Ticktin called the ruling a “kick in the teeth.”
“Of course, we are disappointed by the decision by Judge Middlebrooks. We attempted to right a wrong, and our reward is a kick in the teeth,” Ticktin told CNN. “Ultimately, this will be decided by a panel of three judges of the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals, as we believe that the dismissal and the sanctions which followed will ultimately be reversed.”
Trump has also appealed the dismissal of the lawsuit.
This story has been updated with additional details.

Christian Edwards, CNN
Kathleen Martinez, an archaeologist at the University of Santo Domingo, has been searching for the lost tomb of Cleopatra for nearly 20 years. Now she believes she's made a pivotal breakthrough.
Martinez and her team uncovered a 1,305-meter (4,281-foot) tunnel, located 13 meters (43 feet) underground, the Egyptian Ministry for Tourism and Antiquities recently announced -- an architectural design experts called an ""engineering miracle.""
""The excavation revealed a huge religious center with three sanctuaries, a sacred lake, more than 1,500 objects, busts, statues, golden pieces, a huge collection of coins portraying Alexander the Great, Queen Cleopatra and the Ptolemies,"" Martinez told CNN.

""The most interesting discovery is the complex of tunnels leading to the Mediterranean Sea and sunken structures,"" she added. Exploring these underwater structures will be the next stage of her search for the Egyptian queen's lost tomb -- a journey that began in 2005.
""My perseverance cannot be confused with obsession. I admire Cleopatra as a historical character. She was a victim of propaganda by the Romans, aiming to distort her image,"" Martinez said.
""She was an educated woman, probably the first one who studied formally at the Museum in Alexandria, the center of culture in her time,"" according to Martinez, who said she admires Cleopatra as a student, a linguist, a mother and a philosopher.
When her husband, the Roman general Mark Antony, died in her arms in 30 BCE, Cleopatra took her own life soon after by allowing an asp to bite her, according to popular belief. The moment has been immortalized in art and literature -- but, more than two millennia later, little is known about where their remains lie.

A series of clues led Martinez to believe Cleopatra's tomb might be located in the Temple of Osiris in the ruined city of Taposiris Magna, on Egypt's northern coast, where the Nile River meets the Mediterranean.
Chief among them was the name itself. According to Martinez, Cleopatra was considered in her time to be ""the human incarnation of the goddess Isis,"" as Antony was considered to be that of the god Orisis, Isis' husband.
Martinez believes Cleopatra may have chosen to bury her husband in the temple to reflect this myth. Of all the 20 temples around Alexandria she has studied, Martinez said, ""no other place, structure or temple combines so many conditions as the temple of Taposiris Magna.""
Excavations so far have unearthed more than 1,500 ancient objects. Credit: Egyptian Ministry of Tourism
In 2004, Martinez took her theory to Zahi Hawass, an Egyptian archaeologist who was then Egypt's minister for antiquities affairs. Her project was approved a year later.
And after years of searching, Martinez feels she is getting close.
The excavations so far have revealed that ""the temple was dedicated to Isis"" -- which Martinez believes is another sign that the lost tomb lies nearby -- as well as the tunnels below the sea.

Now, Martinez said, she is at ""the beginning of a new journey"" -- underwater excavations.
According to a statement issued by the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities, the Egyptian coastline has been battered by earthquakes over the centuries, causing parts of the Taposiris Magna to collapse and sink under the waves.
This is where Martinez and her team are looking next. Although it is ""too early to know where these tunnels lead,"" she is hopeful.
If the tunnels lead to Cleopatra, ""it will be the most important discovery of the century,"" she said.

Liz Cheney calls election results ‘clear victory for team normal’ and rejection of Trump
By Rashard Rose, CNN
Published 9:33 PM EST, Thu November 10, 2022
Republican Rep. Liz Cheney speaks during the Anti-Defamation League's ""Never is Now"" summit in New York on November 10, 2022.

CNN
 — 
Rep. Liz Cheney on Thursday said the results of this week’s midterm elections were “a clear victory for Team Normal,” and a “rejection of the toxicity” of former President Donald Trump.
“I think that it was a clear victory for Team Normal, and we have a huge amount of work to do,” said Cheney, speaking at the Anti-Defamation League’s Never Is Now Summit on Antisemitism and Hate.
“But I think that you saw in really important races around the country people coming together to say we believe in democracy,” the Wyoming Republican added. “We believe in standing up for the Constitution, and for the Republic. And a real rejection of the toxicity, and the hate, and vitriol, and of Donald Trump.”
Cheney, the vice chair of the House select committee investigating January 6, 2021, will be leaving office in fewer than two months, following a resounding defeat in her August primary to a Trump-backed challenger. Her continued criticism of Trump for his role in inciting the attack on the US Capitol was seen as a key factor in her defeat.
But Cheney made clear Thursday that she is intent on trying to shape the next session of Congress and stop – or limit – the scope of a potential Republican majority not committed to protecting democracy.
“I think that the changes that we’re seeing in terms of, you know, bipartisanship on behalf of the Constitution, for example, in terms of my campaigning for some of my colleagues who happen to be Democrats, reflects the challenges and the threats that we’re facing as a nation,” Cheney said.
In the weeks leading up to Election Day, Cheney had crossed party lines to stump for two moderate Democrats in highly competitive House races.
“And I think that for me, as well as for my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, there’s just been a real recognition of we don’t minimize our policy disagreements,” Cheney said.
“We absolutely have policy disagreements, but we recognize that there’s something much bigger and more at stake and that we have to come together and stand for fundamental democratic principles, stand for the rule of law. And that in order to defeat the anti-democratic forces at work in our country today, it’s going to require a level of bipartisanship that you might not have seen otherwise,” Cheney said.
Asked about the rise in hate speech, Cheney said, “What we know from history is that you cannot tolerate hate speech, and in particular you cannot tolerate antisemitism.”
“Both parties talk about that we need to be a big tent and that’s right. But we also on both sides need to be able to say there are some views that must never be in the tent,” Cheney added. “There are some views that cannot be accepted.”

Divers uncover a surprising discovery near the wreck of the Titanic

CNN
 — 
The wreck of the Titanic sits in two parts at the bottom of the North Atlantic Ocean, slowly decaying nearly 4,000 meters (13,000 feet) below the surface, but it’s not alone. A sonar blip detected around 26 years ago has now revealed there’s much more to this underwater area than previously thought.
P.H. Nargeolet, a veteran Nautile submersible pilot and Titanic diver, originally picked up the blip on echo sounding equipment in 1996, but its origins have remained unknown.

In an expedition to the Titanic shipwreck earlier this year, Nargeolet and four other researchers went to the blip’s previously recorded location to search for the mysterious object it represented. Due to the blip’s magnitude, Nargeolet had believed he was looking for another shipwreck — he instead found a rocky reef, made up of various volcanic formations, and thriving with lobsters, deep-sea fish, sponges and several species of coral that could be thousands of years old.
“It is biologically fascinating. The animals that live there are very different to the animals that are found otherwise living in the abyssal ocean,” said Murray Roberts, a professor of applied marine biology and ecology at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland and one of the researchers on the expedition. “(Nargeolet) did a really important piece of scientific work. He thought it was a shipwreck, and it turned out, in my mind, even more amazing than a shipwreck.”
Spooky spots to explore from the US to Asia
The abyssal plain is a term used to describe the ocean floor at a water depth of 3,000 to 4,000 meters (around 12,000 feet), which makes up 60% of Earth’s surface, according to Roberts. It is thought to be a featureless, muddy seabed without much structure. On a few occasions, divers have observed rocky formations on the plain. Since the recent discovery near the Titanic, Roberts now believes such features might be more common than previously thought.
Rocky areas may also help explain the distances that sponges and corals travel across the ocean floor, which has always been a mystery to scientists. Within the muddy environment where they are typically observed, there are few hard surfaces for these species to latch onto in order to grow and reproduce.

“Sometimes they turn up in places where we think, ‘Well, how did they get there? They don’t live long enough to get there,” Roberts said. “But if there are more of these rocky places, these stepping stones, than we ever thought, I think it could help us understand the distribution of these species across the ocean.”

The researchers are currently working on analyzing images and videos taken of the reef during their dive, and they intend to share their findings to improve the scientific community’s collective knowledge of deep-sea life. Roberts also hopes to link this discovery to a wider Atlantic Ocean ecosystem project he leads, called iAtlantic, that will allow for further study and protection of the fragile ecosystem within the reef.

There is another sonar blip near the Titanic that Nargeolet is hoping to identify on a future expedition. It was recorded in the same survey he performed years ago, in between the wreck of the Titanic and the newly uncovered reef — now named the Nargeolet-Fanning Ridge after him and the 2022 expedition’s mission specialist Oisín Fanning. Nargeolet expects whatever it is to be even bigger than this reef.
OceanGate Expeditions and their foundation — which, along with Fanning, provided the financial support for Nargeolet’s dive this year — will continue its longitudinal research work of the Titanic and surrounding areas in 2023.
“The marine life … was so beautiful. It was really unbelievable, because I was never expecting to see that in my life,” Nargeolet said. “I’ll be very happy to continue to look at the Titanic.”

Dave Chappelle’s representative says there is no ‘SNL’ writers boycott ahead of his hosting gig
By Lisa Respers France, CNN
Published 7:34 PM EST, Thu November 10, 2022
Dave Chappelle, seen here performing onstage during a ceremony at Duke Ellington School of the Arts on June 20, 2022 in Washington, DC, is set to host 'SNL' this weekend, a move that has been met with criticism.

CNN
 — 
Dave Chappelle’s representative is pushing back on a report that claimed “Saturday Night Live” writers were staging a boycott ahead of his hosting the show this weekend.
On Wednesday, The New York Post, citing an anonymous source, reported writers on the show were going to sit out on the episode.
“We’ve seen nothing to support media reports of a writer’s boycott,” Chappelle’s rep told CNN in a statement. “In fact, the writers delivered over 40 sketches for Dave’s consideration and collaboration. Just as during Dave’s past ‘SNL’ appearances, you won’t want to miss it!”
Ad Feedback
It will be Chappelle’s third time hosting.
‘SNL’ made the announcement about his return to Studio 8H last week.
News of Chappelle’s hosting was met with some furor on social media given his controversial comments over the years about the transgender community, especially given that the show announced in September that it was adding its first non-binary cast member, comedian and actor Molly Kearney, and has a trans non-binary writer, Celeste Yim.
CNN has reached out to representatives for “SNL,” its creator Lorne Michaels, Kearney and Yim for comment.
Chappelle has made jokes about the trans community in sets over the years and found himself on the receiving end of backlash from some members of the LGBTQ+ community and allies.
Most recently, 2021 Netflix special “The Closer” increased the ire after Chappelle said he was “team TERF,” the abbreviated term for “trans-exclusionary radical feminist.”
“Gender is a fact,” Chappelle said during the special. “Every human being in this room, every human being on earth, had to pass through the legs of a woman to be on earth. That is a fact.”
Approximately 65 Netflix employees staged a walkout amid the controversy and, earlier this year, one venue canceled Chappelle’s planned appearance after receiving criticism over the decision to have him perform.
Netflix stood by its decision to stream the special.

Noose found at Obama Presidential Center construction site, officials say

 — 
A noose was discovered at the Obama Presidential Center construction site in Chicago Thursday, prompting the group overseeing the project to suspend work at the site.
Lakeside Alliance, a joint venture of multiple construction companies working on the center, issued a statement saying they reported the incident to police and “will provide any assistance required to identify those responsible.”
Work remained paused on Friday, according to a spokesperson for the joint venture, though CNN observed crews moving heavy machinery at the site.
“Vehicles will be going in and out of the site today as Lakeside Alliance team members prepare for anti-bias training that will begin next week and to secure the site,” the spokesperson told CNN on Friday. “The Chicago Department of Transportation has a significant project that surrounds the site on three sides, and their work is ongoing.”
The spokesperson said “ancillary construction services required to maintain the safety and security of the site may occur throughout the day.”
The group is offering a reward of $100,000 for information leading to those responsible, according to an earlier statement, on Thursday, which added that they have “zero tolerance for any form of bias or hate on our worksite.”
“We are suspending all operations onsite in order to provide another series of these trainings and conversations for all staff and workers,” Thursday’s statement read, referencing anti-bias training that is part of its onboarding process. “We are horrified that this would occur on our site … Lakeside Alliance remains committed to providing a work environment where everyone can feel safe, be their best self, and is treated with dignity and respect.”
Obama breaks ground on presidential library in Chicago
The Obama Foundation also released a statement saying they notified authorities.
“This shameless act of cowardice and hate is designed to get attention and divide us. Our priority is protecting the health and safety of our workforce,” the foundation’s statement read.
The Chicago Police Department told CNN they are “aware of this matter and it is under investigation.”
The Obama Presidential Center was first announced in 2015, when the Barack Obama Foundation officially said Chicago’s South Side would be home to the project. The former president also considered his birthplace of Honolulu, Hawaii, for the library, but Chicago, the longtime favorite for the library, won out.
The center will serve as the foundation’s headquarters and a presidential library.
Obama selected Chicago because – as he put it in the 2015 video announcing his selection – it is the place where “all the strands of my life came together.” He noted his political career began in the city, and it’s where he and Michelle Obama met.
The project, however, has been slowed by lawsuits and some local complaints. In 2019, a federal judge dismissed a lawsuit that tried to prevent the library from being built in Jackson Park and said that construction should begin immediately. The lawsuit was brought by environmentalists who took issue with public land being used for a private project.
The Obamas finally broke ground on the center in September 2021. They were joined by Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot and Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker.
CNN’s Adrienne Broaddus, Virginia Langmaid, Allie Malloy, Caroline Kelly and Bill Kirkos contributed to this report.

Donald Trump believes we should terminate “all rules, regulations and articles, even those found in the Constitution” to overturn the 2020 election. That was his view on 1/6 and remains his view today. No honest person can now deny that Trump is an enemy of the Constitution.

 — 
Chris Rock is coming live to a screen near you.
Netflix announced Thursday that the legendary comedian will make history as the headliner of the streaming giant’s first-ever live, global streaming event.
“Chris Rock is one of the most iconic and important comedic voices of our generation,” Robbie Praw, Netflix’s vice president of stand-up and comedy formats, said in a statement. “We’re thrilled the entire world will be able to experience a live Chris Rock comedy event and be a part of Netflix history. This will be an unforgettable moment and we’re so honored that Chris is carrying this torch.”
It will be Rock’s second Netflix stand-up special. His first, “Chris Rock: Tamborine,’ debuted in February 2018.
Though this will be Netflix’s first time streaming one, it is no stranger to live comedy events.
“Netflix is a Joke: The Festival” took place in spring and featured more than 330 comedians who performed 295 shows across more than 35 venues in Los Angeles, including the first-ever stand-up show at Dodger Stadium. The event sold more than 260,000 tickets.
Rock has been on the road with his Ego Death World Tour and has a series of comedy tour dates scheduled for venues in California in December with friend and fellow comic Dave Chappelle.
Rock’s live Netflix comedy special is set to stream in early 2023.

 — 
The world is watching the world’s richest man single-handedly destroy one of the world’s most powerful and important communication platforms, just weeks after acquiring it for $44 billion. And of course, the world is watching the dramatic spectacle unfold on — where else? — Twitter.
It’s hard to succinctly summarize the absolute chaos that has consumed Twitter over the last 12 hours as Elon Musk continues to wreak havoc on the Silicon Valley company. “It feels like the beginning of the end, honestly,” one recently laid-off Twitter employee said Thursday evening, describing the company as the “Titanic” with “everyone looking for lifeboats.”
Several of those employees, apparently, are top executives. Platformer scooped Thursday evening that Trust and Safety head Yoel Roth had resigned. Bloomberg reported that its advertising chief Robin Wheeler was on the way out. And earlier in the day, we learned that Twitter’s chief information security officer Lea Kissner resigned, as had chief privacy officer Damien Kieran.
A version of this article first appeared in the “Reliable Sources” newsletter. Sign up for the daily digest chronicling the evolving media landscape here.
To make matters worse, the exits of Kissner and Kieran came after a senior member of Twitter’s legal team warned in an internal company message that Musk’s sole priority was “recouping the losses he’s incurring as a result of failing to get out of his binding obligation to buy Twitter.” The employee added that Musk was unconcerned about potential liability before the Federal Trade Commission, which seemingly raised eyebrows at the federal agency. A spokesperson for the agency said it’s “tracking recent developments at Twitter with deep concern.”
“No CEO or company is above the law, and companies must follow our consent decrees,” the spokesperson added. “Our revised consent order gives us new tools to ensure compliance, and we are prepared to use them.”
But Musk has several other distressing problems as well.
The loss of the senior executives, especially Roth and Wheeler, will make it extraordinarily difficult to lure already skeptical advertisers back to the social media site. And with Musk effectively nuking verification on Twitter, giving way to an explosion of trolls and others creating imposter accounts, it’s hard to see why advertisers would put their money (and faith) into Twitter.
And given that Twitter heavily relies on advertising revenue, the developments spell exceptionally troubling news for the already-imperiled company.
Which is why Musk perhaps is already floating the possibility that Twitter might collapse. In his first all-staff email, where he abruptly announced mandatory return-to-office, Musk warned that “the economic picture ahead is dire” and said “without significant subscription revenue, there is a good chance Twitter will not survive the upcoming economic downturn.” In his first meeting with Twitter employees, Bloomberg reported that Musk said bankruptcy is on the table if the company doesn’t soon start generating more cash.
Maybe Twitter will find a path forward. But the road ahead looks quite arduous. As the non-profit watchdog Accountable Tech put it Thursday evening: “This hellscape is going to get more hellish. More hate speech and harassment. More deception and impersonation. More privacy and security risks for all of us. We would once again tell advertisers to jump ship, but at this point, no CMO in their right mind needs that advice.”

‘That certainly didn’t help’: GOP blame game spreads after midterm shortfalls
By Alex Rogers, Manu Raju and Melanie Zanona, CNN
Published 6:20 PM EST, Thu November 10, 2022

CNN
 — 
Mitch McConnell’s high-spending super PAC has a suggestion for their party’s campaign committee: Consider picking candidates in primaries who won’t collapse in the general election.
Others see a much bigger issue: Former President Donald Trump and his polarizing presence on the campaign trail – especially as he teased a 2024 campaign in the final days of the midterms.
“That certainly didn’t help,” one Republican lawmaker said.
Then there’s abortion, and Republican hand-wringing over their party’s failure to effectively respond to an onslaught of Democratic attacks. All the while, some are taking out their frustration at party leaders like McConnell and Kevin McCarthy.
“Washington Republicanism lost big Tuesday night,” said Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican.
The blame game taking shape in GOP circles comes after bullish predictions of a red wave that failed to materialize. Republicans are now at risk of serving in the Senate minority for the second straight Congress and are struggling to take even a narrow House majority.
After getting burned in 2010 and 2012 primaries where weak general election candidates cost his party the Senate majority, McConnell and his allies got more involved in primaries in subsequent cycles to knock off candidates they thought could cost them critical seats. But in 2022, the National Republican Senatorial Committee, the party’s main campaign arm, did not interfere in the primaries.
The party has performed better in races where it was united.
In Nevada, former state attorney general Adam Laxalt is locked in a tight race with Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto as votes are being counted, and in Georgia, former football star Herschel Walker will face Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock in a December 6 runoff. But in New Hampshire and Arizona – states where McConnell’s super PAC, the Senate Leadership Fund, and the NRSC had different strategies – retired Army brigadier general Don Bolduc lost and venture capitalist Blake Masters is trailing. And Dr. Mehmet Oz, who survived a brutal primary with Trump’s endorsement, lost in a race that could ultimately cost their party the majority.
Retiring Pennsylvania Republican Sen. Pat Toomey said on CNN Thursday that Oz suffered because gubernatorial GOP nominee Doug Mastriano, a far-right Trump ally, “ended up losing in an epic beat down,” dragging down the rest of the ticket.
“There’s a very high correlation between MAGA candidates and big losses,” added Toomey, referring to Trump’s “Make America Great Again” slogan. “I think my party needs to face the fact that if fealty to Donald Trump is the primary criteria for selecting candidates, we’re probably not going to do really well.”
In an interview with CNN, Steven Law, the head of SLF, said the party needs to discuss whether the NRSC should again take a “hands-off approach to primaries.” And he specifically pointed out that former hard-nosed NRSC political operatives like Ward Baker, who helped flip the Senate in the 2014 midterms, “hardly took a passive approach to anything, let alone candidate selection.”
National Republican Senatorial Committee spokesman Chris Hartline defended the group’s strategy.
“Chairman (Rick) Scott and the NRSC respect the will of Republican primary voters and we were proud to stand by our candidates every step of the way,” Hartline said. “Anyone who hates our candidates hates the Republican voters who chose them. It’s as simple as that. Others are welcome to get involved in primaries, but that’s not something the NRSC does.”
Scott, a Florida Republican senator, had been bullish of his assessment, predicting 52 GOP Senate seats and even saying there was a path to 55. McConnell, meanwhile, stayed away from making predictions and long viewed the race for the Senate as a jump ball.
In the interview, Law said that their narrow strategy was partly “driven” by Democratic candidates’ ability to outraise Republicans, and “solidified” after they saw the “[National] Republican Senatorial Committee was having severe financial problems.”
“Our approach to the cycle was to concentrate our activities around a realistic path toward 51 seats, not to hope for a gigantic red wave that might somehow transport us to a much larger majority,” Law told CNN.
There were other major differences in strategy between the SLF and NRSC besides outlook. One was in messaging; McConnell wanted a referendum on Biden’s agenda, while Scott wanted to also promote a platform of what a Republican Senate could do.
Another was how to spend resources. The NRSC wanted to define Democrats “early and heavily,” which meant spending money sooner in the election cycle, even though Scott’s GOP critics worried it would leave Republican candidates – and the Senate Leadership Fund – holding the bag in the crucial final weeks of the campaign. (Law himself commended the NRSC for its “late advertising support to underfunded candidates.”)
But ad reservations revealed the groups’ clashing strategies. In August and September, SLF pulled out of Arizona as Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly vastly outraised Masters and other conservative groups got behind the Republican nominee. The NRSC then announced it would spend for Masters, a controversial Trump-backed candidate who had pushed for “new leadership” in the Senate.
And in the New Hampshire primary, the Senate Leadership Fund supported state Senate president Chuck Morse. Days before the Senate GOP election, popular Republican Gov. Chris Sununu, who had passed on a bid for Senate despite GOP leaders’ pleas, endorsed Morse. After Bolduc still won the primary, the McConnell super PAC pulled its reservation, and the NRSC announced it would go up on air supporting the nominee.
“I think certainly if Gov. Sununu would’ve really leaned in a big way to help Morse that would have been impactful,” Law said.
Sununu spokesman Ben Vihstadt responded, “Chris Sununu endorsed Chuck Morse, campaigned for him, and gave him a boost at the most critical time in the primary.”
The GOP’s other problems
Besides sparking a debate over political tactics, the results of the 2022 elections underscored Republicans’ struggles in dealing with two major issues: Trump and abortion.
In June, the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and the constitutional right to an abortion, sending the issue to the states. While the majority of Americans support a right to the procedure, and conservatives had fought for nearly 50 years to strip it away, Republicans seemed unprepared for a nationwide fight over abortion.
Some anti-abortion groups criticized Republican leadership for not crafting a unifying strategy, and candidates who tried to duck the issue in swing races.
While Marjorie Jones Dannenfelser, the president of Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, praised the victories of conservative candidates like Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, she sounded dejected at one point on a Wednesday call with reporters.
“I just want to emphasize the reason that we sound slightly disappointed is because the expectations were so high,” said Dannenfelser. “I’m not a pollster, though I know some. And so their expectations were very high.”
Dannenfelser particularly criticized Pennsylvania Republican Senate nominee Mehmet Oz, who lost, she said, because he adopted an “ostrich” or “possum” stance in attempting to avoid the hot-button issue. “Oz lost – and others – because they hoped that the issue would go away,” added Dannenfelser.
Oz aides did not respond to a request for comment. In his debate last month, Oz said “women, doctors, local political leaders” should decide abortion policy. Abortion was the top issue in the Pennsylvania Senate race, according to exit polling data conducted for CNN and other news networks by Edison Research, and Oz appeared to perform poorly among those who said it was their most important.
A House Republican also said the party was hurt by its lack of a cohesive message on abortion, saying most Republicans “turned their backs on women after Roe.”
‘I would like to see the party move forward’
Over the past two days, Republicans have also pointed fingers at the former president, who saw the House and Senate flip blue the past two cycles, and all of his endorsed candidates in 2022 “toss-up” House seats lose.
Since he left office, Trump has refused to concede the 2020 election, trying to force the entire Republican party to embrace his falsehood that he won, and criticized those who acknowledged the truth like McConnell. Republicans like Masters and Bolduc won the primary catering to Trump’s whims, and rejected McConnell. In the general election, Bolduc changed his position on whether the 2020 election was stolen, and after his loss, Trump attacked him for flipping.
Throughout the election cycle, McCarthy and party leaders consistently said Trump would play a key role in their midterm strategy and did not seek to put any distance between the GOP and the former president. But behind the scenes, leaders counseled Republican candidates to not make Trump a focus of their campaigns.
Meanwhile, a key part of the Democrats’ midterm message was linking Republicans to the Trump-wing of the party, painting their GOP opponents as “MAGA extremists.” At the time, Republicans scoffed at the effectiveness of the label.
GOP Rep.-elect Mike Lawler of New York, who toppled the head of the Democrats’ campaign committee, said he would like to see Republicans move past the former president.
“I would like to see the party move forward,” Lawler told CNN “This Morning.” “I think anytime you are focused on the future, you can’t so much go to the past. And I think people are really excited about the opportunity to address the challenges that we’re facing as a country, and I think more focus needs to be on the issues and the substance of those issues than on personalities.”
Trump’s near-constant presence in the media, driven in part by decisions to publicly campaign in the final weeks before Election Day, also diminished the Republican argument that the election was a referendum on the Biden administration, rather than a choice between the two parties.
“Trump hurt us,” said another senior House GOP lawmaker.
Law, whose organization spent $211.5 million on TV ads this cycle and an additional $73 million from its affiliated nonprofit, the most of any group in Senate races this cycle, indicated that Trump’s reemergence on the campaign trail could’ve helped Democrats.
“What was critical to winning the midterm, as any midterm, is to make the focus of the election a referendum on the President and his party in Congress. And Democrats were desperate to make the election a choice and to some extent they succeeded in individual races and also in the overall environment,” Law added. “But keeping the focus on Joe Biden and Democrats who had voted for inflationary spending and who supported soft on crime policies, those are the priorities. And to the extent that there’s any distraction from that, it diminishes our ability to drive home that argument.”
But not everyone in the party was eager to assign blame to Trump. Rep. Elise Stefanik, who is running for another term as GOP conference chair and has been floated as a potential Trump running mate, said she fully supports Trump running again in 2024 and encouraged the rest of her party to unite behind him.
“I am proud to endorse Donald Trump for president in 2024,” Stefanik said in a statement to CNN. “It is time for Republicans to unite around the most popular Republican in America who has a proven track record of conservative governance.”

Listeria outbreak: How to protect yourself from the deadly foodborne bacteria
By Sandee LaMotte, CNN
Published 3:01 PM EST, Thu November 10, 2022

What is listeria?
01:20 - Source: CNN
CNN
 — 
A deadly outbreak of listeria in six states has been linked to contaminated deli meat and cheese, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has announced. But what can you do reduce your risk of becoming infected?
What to know
Listeria is a hardy germ, so determined to stick around that it can continue to grow while refrigerated, which even fellow bacterial villains salmonella and E. coli cannot do.
In the United States, listeria is the third leading cause of death from foodborne illness, killing about 260 a year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Deadly listeria outbreak in 6 states linked to deli meat and cheese
“Even with adequate antibiotic treatment, the disease has a high mortality rate” of 20% to 30%, the US Food and Drug Administration said.
Pregnant people are about 10 times more likely to become sick from listeria, and the illness can be fatal to the fetus. Pregnant Hispanics are at highest risk, likely due to eating traditional soft cheeses such as queso fresco and other foods made with milk that is unpasteurized, the FDA said. Foods made with raw milk are 50 to 160 times more likely to contain listeria, the agency said.
Adults and children with healthy immune systems may simply develop a mild or unpleasant illness that will not require hospitalization or antibiotics. However, anyone immunocompromised, such as older adults, organ transplant patents, those with cancer or kidney disease, diabetes or people with HIV/AIDS, can become seriously ill and die.
Always thoroughly wash certain leafy greens such as romaine lettuce.
The latest outbreak, which caused a pregnancy loss and the death of an adult in Maryland, has been linked to the sale of deli meats and cheeses. To date, 16 people have been infected, and 13 have been hospitalized, but “the true number of sick people in this outbreak is likely higher than the number reported, and the outbreak may not be limited to the states with known illnesses,” the CDC said Wednesday.
Deli meat and hot dogs were a common source of listeria outbreaks in the 1990s, according to the CDC, likely because of the difficulty in cleaning the resistant bacteria from every nook and cranny in deli food preparation devices.
However, listeria outbreaks have been linked to cantaloupe, celery, ice cream, leafy greens such as spinach, soft cheeses and sprouts, the agency said.
How to protect yourself
Keep the kitchen clean: Clean your refrigerator regularly with hot water and liquid soap. Prepare meats and vegetables separately and be sure to sanitize food preparation areas, the CDC said.
Keep the fridge cool: Because listeria can easily grow in cool temperatures, keep your refrigerator at 41 degrees Fahrenheit (5 degrees Celsius) or lower. The freezer should be at zero Fahrenheit (minus 18 degrees Celsius) or lower.
Raw milk: Eating foods made from raw milk is “one of the riskiest” ways to become infected with listeria and other harmful germs, the CDC said.
Soft cheese: If you are pregnant or at high risk, don’t eat soft cheeses, “such as queso fresco, queso blanco, panela (queso panela), brie, Camembert, blue-veined, or feta, unless it is labeled as made with pasteurized milk,” the CDC said.
However, know that some soft cheeses have been contaminated during cheese making, the agency said.
Homemade baby food contains as many toxic metals as store-bought options, report says
Sprouts: You can’t just rinse bacteria off alfalfa, clover, radish, mung bean or any type of sprout, the CDC said. High-risk individuals should not eat raw or even lightly cooked sprouts. Always thoroughly heat sprouts first — even homegrown versions can harbor bacteria, the CDC said. When eating out, be sure to ask that no raw spouts be added to your food.
Leafy greens: Certain leafy greens such as kale, spinach, lettuces and wild rocket grow lower to the ground and are more likely to become contaminated by listeria in the soil. Always thoroughly wash any greens to be safe, the CDC said. Use these steps:
Wash up for 20 seconds with soapy water both before and after handling any leafy greens.
Don’t soak greens in the sink — that just spreads any bacteria on one leaf to all the leaves.
Remove any torn, bruised or outer leaves.
Under running water, scrub each leaf gently and then dry the leaves with a clean cloth.
Melons: Melons are another source of listeria infection. Eat cut melon right away and throw away any unrefrigerated for four or more hours, the CDC said. Refrigerate cut melons at 41 F (5 C) or colder for no more than seven days.
Deli meats and hot dogs: If you are pregnant or at high risk, don’t eat cold cuts such as bologna, hot dogs, lunch meats, fermented or dry sausages or any other deli meats unless they are heated to steaming hot (165 F or 74 C) just before serving, the agency said.
“Do not eat refrigerated pâté or meat spreads from a deli or meat counter or from the refrigerated section of a store,” the CDC said. “Meat spreads and pâté that do not need refrigeration before opening, such as products in cans, jars, or sealed pouches, are a safer choice. Refrigerate these foods after opening.”
Anyone eating these foods at home should be careful not to allow juice from hot dog and lunch meat packages to get on other foods or food preparation surfaces, plates and utensils. Always carefully wash your hands after touching any type of hot dog, lunch or deli meat, the agency said.
How to stop throwing away your veggies and fruit
Be aware of how long you store such foods in your home. Factory-sealed unopened packages of hot dogs, lunch and deli meats should be thrown away after two weeks in the fridge, the CDC said. Toss opened packages of deli meats or any sliced by a deli after three to five days, and hot dogs after one week.
Cold smoked fish: Don’t eat cold smoked fish “unless it is canned or shelf-stable or it is in a cooked dish, such as a casserole” if you are at high risk, the CDC said.
Shelf-stable foods, such as canned tuna, sardines and salmon, will not increase the risk of listeria. But not all canned foods are shelf-stable, the CDC said.
“Some canned foods are labeled ‘Keep Refrigerated.’ Examples of such items include cold smoked fish, such as salmon, trout, whitefish, cod, tuna, and mackerel,” the CDC said. “Cold smoked fish items are often labeled as ‘nova-style,’ ‘lox,’ ‘kippered,’ ‘smoked,’ or ‘jerky’ and typically found at seafood or deli counters of grocery stores and delicatessens.”

Donald Trump believes we should terminate “all rules, regulations and articles, even those found in the Constitution” to overturn the 2020 election. That was his view on 1/6 and remains his view today. No honest person can now deny that Trump is an enemy of the Constitution.

World's tallest woman takes her first flight after the airline modifies several seats
AJ Willingham, CNN • Updated 10th November 2022
Facebook
Twitter
Email
(CNN) — Rumeysa Gelgi, the world's tallest living woman, recently boarded an airplane from her home country of Turkey to San Francisco.
However, it wasn't just any flight. It was Gelgi's first, and one that highlighted a growing attention to accessibility.
Gelgi, 25, stands at 7 feet, 0.7 inches tall. Her proportions are a result of Weaver syndrome, a rare genetic condition that causes bone overgrowth. She has been a Guinness World Record celebrity since her teens, and holds records in several size-related categories, including the longest fingers on a living person and the longest back on a living female person.
Gelgi regularly travels to share her story, and uses her warm wit to spread body positivity on social media. However, despite her international profile, she had never flown on an airplane before. Like many people with Weaver syndrome, Gelgi uses mobility aids to get around, and a long flight would require special accommodation for her extraordinary frame.
But in September, Gelgi finally took to the skies. In an Instagram post a few weeks later, she shared photos from her trip aboard Turkish Airlines, which was made possible after the airlines removed several seats on the plane so Gelgi could rest comfortably on a stretcher during the 13-hour journey from Istanbul to California.
""A flawless journey from start to finish,"" Gelgi said on Instagram, praising Turkish Airlines staff and medical personnel for their work. Gelgi said that although it was her first plane ride, ""it certainly won't be my last.""
In her photos, Gelgi appears to get the VIP treatment, conversing with smiling staff aboard the plane and enjoying a first-class meal.
Gelgi, who is a computer programmer as well as a public advocate, says she is spending her time in San Francisco working with Guinness World Records.
CNN has reached out to Turkish Airlines and Guinness World Records for comment.
Making air travel more accessible for everyone
Gelgi's recent trip highlights a growing awareness of airline accessibility for people with physical differences and disabilities. Historically, air travel has been inconvenient at best for such travelers, and, at worst, abusive and painful.
CNN talked to Linda Ristagno, Assistant Director of External Affairs at the International Air Transport Association, which sets global standards for air travel. Ristagno, who recently received the Open Doors Organization's Disability Access Professional Award for her work, described what kinds of global and structural efforts are underway to improve accessibility for all travelers.
""We are devoted to ensuring all passengers can enjoy the freedom of air travel, and we expect standards [among participating airlines and airports] to be consistent so the same level of assistance can be offered to everyone,"" she said.

Travelers have a lot to say about shrinking airplane seats
Ristagno says a recent meeting of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), a United Nations agency, produced a historic resolution that will better allow different parts of the industry to work together to improve accessibility.
""This resolution encourages governments to collaborate with airlines and disability organizations, and all actors, including travelers with disabilities, to reach solutions,"" she said.
One of the biggest priorities this resolution can help with is the principle of ""universal design,"" in which accessibility is built into the very structure of buildings and mechanisms, rather than treated as an addition or modification.
Additionally, Ristagno says industry groups and state organizations are also trying to improve infrastructure and procedures around the transport of mobility aids such as motorized wheelchairs -- a particular pain point when it comes to accessible travel.
""The root of the challenges airlines face in the loading and safe storage of mobility aids is few have been designed with air transport in mind,"" she explains. ""That becomes even more challenging as mobility aids grow in size, complexity and weight. There is risk of injury in transporting them, and risk of damaging the device.""

By looking at the issue from all angles, air travel groups like IATA, ICAO and participating parties can explore long-term solutions, including design improvements that allow for easier navigation in airports and on planes, and even better-designed mobility aids.
""There's an inherent motivation to raise standards, as these passengers represent a growing section of the demand for air travel,"" Ristagno said. ""Also, disability is a medical term. But accessibility is a social term. We want to make sure we are accessible for all.""

Trump Org. controller said he was ordered to hide benefits on tax forms
By Lauren del Valle, CNN
Published 6:31 PM EST, Thu November 10, 2022

New York
CNN
 — 
Trump Organization Controller Jeffrey McConney testified about the mechanics behind him tacking on fringe benefits to salaries and bonuses at the direction of high-level executives, as the company’s criminal trial in New York resumed on Thursday.
McConney reiterated he followed instructions from former Chief Financial Officer Allen Weisselberg and other high-level Trump Org. executives to tack on fringe benefits to their salaries in bonuses that were ultimately not reported to tax authorities.
Judge scorches and sanctions Trump lawyers for lawsuit against Hillary Clinton and Democrats
McConney also cut bonus checks via 1099 tax forms meant for independent contractors – a method that does not withhold taxes on the employer’s end. Those employees then did not report those bonuses as income on their personal taxes, so they took the money tax-free over several years, he confirmed.
The treatment also allowed the Trump Corporation to not pay payroll or Medicare taxes on the amount of the bonuses, the controller confirmed when asked on the stand.
In addition to the former CFO of Trump Org., Allen Weisselberg’s son Barry and his wife lived for years at a property on Central Park paying monthly rent of $1,000 – well under market value for the location – and part of that amount was covered by the company as a fringe benefit without reporting it to tax authorities, McConney testified.
Trump Org. Chief Operations Officer Matthew Calamari Sr. similarly received a bonus as an independent contractor and fringe benefits including car leases for himself and his wife and $72,000 in annual rent for a Park Avenue apartment that was ultimately not reported to tax authorities, McConney said.
Calamari’s son who also works at the company got certain benefits – his rent at the Central Park South building in New York City was treated as a fringe benefit and records show his father paid at least $130,000 for his apartment renovation through the company without paying taxes on it.
McConney testified that Trump Org.’s tax consultant from Mazars, Donald Bender, never told him the practices of underreporting taxable income were illegal.
But he acknowledged that Bender told him that he “wasn’t a fan” of the practice of issuing bonuses using 1099 tax forms when they could be booked as part of annual compensation from the Trump Corporation and taxed using a W2 tax form.
Around 2011, Bender advised McConney to stop cutting a bonus check to an in-house lawyer at the company because they could lose their law license for receiving it as an independent contractor, but McConney testified that he never questioned whether the illegality of how they handled bonuses would apply to anyone else.
Bender has not been charged with any wrongdoing. He has not responded to multiple requests for comment.
McConney also admitted that he filed tax forms for Weisselberg, Calamari and others improperly reporting to tax authorities that they did not keep residences in New York City, leading them to evade city taxes.
The Trump Org. controller acknowledged that he and other accounting personnel at Trump Org stopped these internal accounting practices in 2017 around the time that a tax consultant conducted an internal review for Trump Org. and President Donald Trump took office.
Trump, New York AG both propose retired judge to serve as monitor of Trump Org.
The jury also saw accounting ledgers for Donald Trump that McConney said appeared to have been doctored, however he couldn’t recall if he had made the changes.
A ledger turned over as evidence by Mazars showed no record of line items with notations that mention Weisselberg.
The ledgers obtained by prosecutors in 2021 directly from Trump Org. in this case show several line items on Donald Trump’s personal ledger with things like tuition for Weisselberg’s grandchilden notated “for Allen.”
The trial will resume on Monday.

Sister of executed Iranian wrestler arrested and identified by state news as ‘agent’

 — 
Iranian officials said they have identified the “Iran International agent” arrested Thursday as Elham Afkari, the sister of famous Iranian wrestler Navid Afkari, who was executed two years ago, according to state news agency IRNA.
London-based news channel Iran International has become one of the go-to sources for many Iranians looking for news on the country’s ongoing protests in the country.
The opposition television broadcaster, which was called a “terrorist” organization by the Iranian intelligence minister on Tuesday, has denied any association with Elham.
In a statement sent to CNN, the London-based broadcaster said Elham “is not an employee of Iran International, nor is she an associate or agent of the company.”
Her brother, Navid Afkari, was convicted of killing Hassan Torkman, a water company security employee, during a protest in Shiraz in 2018.
Wrestler Navid Afkari was executed by the Iranian government on September 12, 2020.
Courtesy United for Navid
Initially, Afkari confessed to the crime, but in court he retracted those words, arguing that he had been tortured into making a false confession.
Executed Iranian wrestler Navid Afkari still offers 'message of freedom,' says mother
“It should be noted that she [Elham Afkari] is the sister of Navid Afkari, the killer of martyr Torkman, an employee of the regional water company of Fars province,” IRNA reported.
“Intelligence operatives have been monitoring the activities of Elham Afkari for the past few years,” IRNA said, adding that “she was one of the main leaders in organizing recent riots.”
State media shared pictures allegedly showing Elham’s arrest. The pictures show a woman seated in the backseat of a vehicle with barred windows, with a black blindfold over her face.
Saeed Afkari, Elham and Navid’s brother, confirmed his sister’s arrest on Twitter on Thursday, saying that Elham’s three-year-old daughter was also missing.
He later said Elham had been taken to a department of Iran’s intelligence ministry, and that his sister’s spouse and daughter had been released.
“Elham was taken to No.100 intelligence ministry department,” he tweeted.
Since Navid Afkari was executed, his family has faced many court cases over involvement in the demonstrations in 2018.
Vahid Afkari, one of his brothers, remains in solitary confinement, according to the rights group Iran Human Rights.
Security concerns for journalists
Founded in 2017, Iran International has been at the forefront of covering recent demonstrations following the death in custody of Mahsa Amini – a 22-year-old Kurdish Iranian woman detained by morality police for allegedly not wearing her hijab properly.
However, the 24-hour news channel’s coverage of the demonstrations has brought it under the scrutiny of the Iranian government.
This week, Iran International said two of its British-Iranian journalists working in the United Kingdom have been warned by police of a “credible” plot by Iran to kill them.
In a statement Monday, the Farsi-language broadcaster said it was “shocked and deeply concerned” by the alleged lethal threats, while accusing Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) of being part of a “significant and dangerous escalation” of Tehran’s “campaign to intimidate Iranian journalists working abroad.”
“Two of our British-Iranian journalists have, in recent days, been notified of an increase in the threats to them,” Iran International said in the statement.
“The Metropolitan Police have now formally notified both journalists that these threats represent an imminent, credible and significant risk to their lives and those of their families.”
Iran International did not name the journalists for security reasons.
The Committee to Protect Journalists said that as of Monday at least 61 journalists have been arrested in Iran for reasons including covering the protests, reporting on the death of protesters, and taking photos of demonstrations, according to a report from the organization.

Gun hidden in a raw chicken found at Florida TSA checkpoint

(CNN) — A gun found inside a raw chicken at an airport security checkpoint has the TSA calling ""personal fowl.""
""The plot chickens,"" the Transportation Security Administration posted this week on Instagram after someone at the agency put on their punny pants and called attention to the ""baste of time"" that is stuffing a bird with a firearm.
The passenger was headed to Port-au-Prince, Haiti, according to Sari Koshetz, a TSA spokesperson for the Gulf region.
Nestor Iglesias, a spokesperson for Homeland Security Investigations, the investigative arm of the US Department of Homeland Security, said he could not offer additional details because it is an ""ongoing criminal case which has been accepted for prosecution.""
A record number of guns have arrived at TSA checkpoints in Florida in 2022. Passengers have brought more than 700 guns to checkpoints at airports in the state so far this year -- a year-to-date number that already surpasses any previous year, according to a TSA news release.
Records have been set at 12 Florida airports, with airports in Orlando (129 guns), Fort Lauderdale (120 guns) and Tampa (102 guns) leading the way.
Nearly all of the guns discovered at checkpoints were loaded, the TSA said, and most had ammunition chambered.
""An accidental discharge could result in tragedy,"" the TSA's Koshetz said in a statement. ""Every passenger bares the responsibility of knowing exactly where their gun is before entering the security checkpoint.""
For many passengers, bringing guns to airports resulted in arrests and notices to appear in court.
Civil penalties from the TSA can reach $13,910 even if the passenger is not arrested, the TSA's news release said.
Firearms must be packed in checked luggage. The TSA outlines specific rules related to guns and ammunition on its website.

Man faces malicious mischief charge after series of fires in Mississippi, including 2 at historically African American churches

 — 
A man was arrested in connection with a series of arsons, including fires at two historically African American churches, early Tuesday in Jackson, Mississippi, authorities said.
The suspect was identified as Devin McLaurin, 23, according to Capt. Crystal Houston of the Hinds County Sheriff’s Office. CNN has been unable to determine if McLaurin has an attorney.
McLaurin was charged with malicious mischief, Houston said. He was arrested after firefighters responded to seven fires, according to Mississippi Insurance Department spokesperson Beth Reiss.
The fires at two churches, two homes, two businesses and a baseball field house started at about 2:30 a.m., Jackson Fire Department Deputy Fire Chief Cleotha Sanders Jr. said via email.

The two churches are historically African American congregations, according to Melissa Payne, a spokesperson for the city of Jackson.
The fires, which were safely extinguished, were intentionally set within a 2-mile radius, Sanders said.
One of the churches, Greater Bethlehem Temple Church, is located two blocks north of Jackson State University, a historically Black college.
“In the nearly 60 years of its existence, the congregation has grown from only five to over 1800 members,” according to the church’s Facebook page.
Epiphany Lutheran Church, nearly a mile away, was also set ablaze.
There were no injuries, according to Sanders.
“I stand with the Jackson Fire Department and Jackson Police Department in their efforts to get to the bottom of these heinous acts,” Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba said in a statement.
“These aren’t simply matters of property destruction – which is bad enough – but two of the properties that were set ablaze were churches that Jackson residents have attended for years. We would like to know – among other things – what the motivation was.”
The motive is not known. The suspect is Black.
No polling locations were affected by the fires, officials said.
State fire marshals are assisting in the investigation.

What student loan borrowers need to know as Biden’s forgiveness program is stuck in legal limbo

 — 
Student loan borrowers are now waiting indefinitely to see if they’ll receive debt relief under President Joe Biden’s student loan forgiveness program while several legal challenges play out across the country.
In the latest legal action, the Department of Justice asked the Supreme Court Friday to allow the program to go into effect in the meantime, noting the impact on “economically vulnerable borrowers.”
It could take weeks, if not months, for the legal issues to be resolved.
A federal judge in Texas struck down the program nationwide on November 10, declaring it illegal, in the most significant legal setback thus far for Biden’s student loan forgiveness program – prompting the Department of Education to stop accepting applications for debt relief.
Biden’s program was already on hold at the time due to a separate legal challenge before the 8th US Circuit Court of Appeals, but the administration had continued accepting applications, having received 26 million to date.
Under the rules of the student loan forgiveness program, eligible low- and middle-income borrowers can receive up to $10,000 of federal student loan forgiveness and up to $20,000 in cancellation if they also received a Pell grant while enrolled in college.
What happens now for borrowers?
Borrowers will have to wait for the lawsuits to play out. While it can be tough to follow all the various legal challenges, borrowers can subscribe for updates from the Department of Education and check the Federal Student Aid website for further information.
Initially, the Biden administration said that it would start granting student loan forgiveness before payments are set to resume in January after a yearslong pandemic pause.
But that timeline is now in jeopardy.
“For the 26 million borrowers who have already given the Department of Education the necessary information to be considered for debt relief – 16 million of whom have already been approved for relief – the Department will hold onto their information so it can quickly process their relief once we prevail in court,” said White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre in a statement following the Texas ruling that struck down the program.
“We strongly disagree with the District Court’s ruling on our student debt relief program,” she said.
The Department of Justice immediately appealed the Texas judge’s ruling to the 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals.
Four days after the Texas decision, the 8th US Circuit Court of Appeals dealt another legal blow to Biden’s program, granting a request for a preliminary injunction sought by six GOP-led states in a separate lawsuit. The ruling did not change the status quo since the program was already struck down.
The government has asked the Supreme Court to block the 8th Circuit Court’s injunction.
What are the legal arguments?
The Biden administration has argued that Congress granted the secretary of education the power to broadly discharge student loan debt in a 2003 law known as the HEROES Act, which was passed in the wake of the September 11 terrorist attacks.
The government’s lawyers argue that the law allows the secretary to discharge debt in an event of a national emergency, including the Covid-19 pandemic.
But the Texas federal judge found that the law does not provide the executive branch clear congressional authorization to create the student loan forgiveness program.
“The program is thus an unconstitutional exercise of Congress’s legislative power and must be vacated,” wrote Judge Mark Pittman, who was nominated by then-President Donald Trump.
“In this country, we are not ruled by an all-powerful executive with a pen and a phone,” he continued.
The Texas lawsuit was filed by a conservative group, the Job Creators Network Foundation, in October on behalf of two borrowers who did not qualify for debt relief.
One plaintiff did not qualify for the student loan forgiveness program because her loans are not held by the federal government and the other plaintiff is only eligible for $10,000 in debt relief because he did not receive a Pell grant.
They argued that they could not voice their disagreement with the program’s rules because the administration did not put it through a formal notice-and-comment rule making process under the Administrative Procedure Act.
“This ruling protects the rule of law which requires all Americans to have their voices heard by their federal government,” said Elaine Parker, president of Job Creators Network Foundation, in a statement following the ruling on November 10.
The advocacy group was founded by Bernie Marcus, a major Trump donor and former Home Depot CEO.
Where do the other lawsuits stand?
Beyond the Texas case, the Biden administration is facing several other lawsuits over the student loan forgiveness program.
A lawsuit brought by six Republican-led states is pending at the 8th US Circuit Court of Appeals. On October 21, that appeals court put an administrative hold on the program, banning the administration from canceling any debt. The appeals court then granted a preliminary injunction request from the states on November 14. The injunction will “remain in effect until further order of this court or the Supreme Court of the United States,” according to the order. The Department of Justice has asked the Supreme Court to vacate the injunction.
The states have argued that the Biden administration does not have the legal authority to grant broad student loan forgiveness, as well as that the program would hurt them financially for a variety of reasons. A lower court had dismissed the case, ruling that the states did not have legal standing to sue. The states immediately appealed to the 8th Circuit.
The Biden administration has had several wins in court thus far, as plaintiffs have struggled to show they have standing to sue.
One lawsuit, filed by a Wisconsin taxpayers group, was also dismissed by a trial-level federal judge, ruling that the group lacked standing to bring the challenge. The plaintiffs had argued that the loan forgiveness program, which is estimated to cost about $400 billion, would hurt taxpayers and the US Treasury. Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett also rejected the taxpayers group’s request for the Supreme Court to intervene.
A separate case, which was also rejected by Barrett and dismissed by a lower court, was filed by a borrower who argued that the forthcoming loan forgiveness would leave him with a bigger state tax bill. Some states may tax the debt forgiveness, but it is not taxable on the federal level.
The Biden administration is also facing pending lawsuits from Arizona’s GOP Attorney General Mark Brnovich and the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank. Both lawsuits argue that the president does not have the legal authority to broadly cancel student loan debt.
Brnovich argues that the state has standing to sue because the student loan forgiveness program could reduce Arizona’s tax revenue. The state code doesn’t consider the loan forgiveness as taxable income.
The Arizona complaint also argues that the forgiveness policy will hurt the attorney general office’s ability to recruit employees. Currently, its employees may be eligible for the federal Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, but some potential job candidates may not view that as a benefit if their student loan debt is already canceled, the lawsuit argues.
The Cato Institute makes a similar argument about the forgiveness program making it harder for it to recruit employees.
Who may be eligible for student loan forgiveness?
If Biden’s program is allowed to move forward, individual borrowers who earned less than $125,000 in either 2020 or 2021 and married couples or heads of households who made less than $250,000 annually in those years could see up to $10,000 of their federal student loan debt forgiven.
If a qualifying borrower also received a federal Pell grant while enrolled in college, the individual is eligible for up to $20,000 of debt forgiveness.
There are a variety of federal student loans and not all are eligible for relief. Federal Direct Loans, including subsidized loans, unsubsidized loans, parent PLUS loans and graduate PLUS loans, are eligible.
But federal student loans that are guaranteed by the government but held by private lenders are not eligible unless the borrower applied to consolidate those loans into a Direct Loan before September 29.

Changes are coming for Wordle … again.
For starters the New York Times (NYT) this week named Tracy Bennett the new editor of Wordle, the wildly popular online puzzle game that gives players six chances to guess a five-letter word daily.
With an editor in place, the Times said that the game is shifting away from the preselected words of Josh Wardle, the puzzle’s creator. It will, instead, include words that the New York Times has chosen.
Also changing: The answer will never be a plural that ends in “s” or “es.” However, you can guess plural words to help you eliminate possible words.
“Wordle’s gameplay will stay the same, and answers will be drawn from the same basic dictionary of answer words, with some editorial adjustments to ensure that the game stays focused on vocabulary that’s fun, accessible, lively and varied,” Everdeen Mason, the Times’ editorial director of games, said on Monday.
Wordle and your brain: Does playing make you smarter?
Mason added that “while the answer list is curated, the much larger dictionary of English words that are valid guesses will not be curated. What solvers choose to use as guess words is their private choice.”
The Times bought Wordle for “low seven figures” earlier this year. It’s a part of the Times’ portfolio of online games that includes the Crossword and Spelling Bee.
Wordle, which was turned into a board game in July, has been a huge success for the news company, helping boost the number of digital subscriptions for the newspaper.
“Wordle brought an unprecedented tens of millions of new users to the Times, many of whom stayed to play other games which drove our best quarter ever for net subscriber additions to Games,” said CEO Meredith Kopit Levien in the earnings release from May.

Biden says democracy met the test on Election Day
By Maegan Vazquez and Nikki Carvajal, CNN

 — 
President Joe Biden said Thursday that democracy met the test on Election Day after warning ahead of the races that the nation’s future would be at stake when Americans cast their ballots earlier this week.
Though neither the US House or Senate majorities have been called for either party, Biden celebrated with fellow Democrats Thursday, touting their ability to stave off the historical headwinds of a dramatic political pendulum swing in Republicans’ favor in the midterm elections.
Speaking to Democratic campaign workers at the Howard Theatre in Washington, DC, Biden called Election Day “a good day for America, a good day for democracy, and … a strong night for Democrats.”
“It was the first national election since January 6 and there were a lot of concerns about whether democracy would meet the test,” the president said. “It did.”
Less than a week before the election, Biden delivered an urgent appeal near Capitol Hill warning that democracy was on the ballot, stating – just blocks from where a mob attempted to interrupt the certification of the 2020 election – that “we can’t take democracy for granted any longer.” Specifically, he called out the “candidates running for every level of office in America – for governor, for Congress, for attorney general, for secretary of state who won’t commit to accepting the results of the elections they’re in.” He also squarely blamed former President Donald Trump for fomenting the wide spread of election misinformation.
As the results of the midterm elections have trickled in this week, Republicans have not seen the dramatic wins they’d hoped would serve as a referendum on Biden’s agenda. Many of Trump’s endorsed candidates in safe Republican seats have won their races, including several election deniers. But Trump’s picks in toss up races – which play a pivotal role in the fate of each chamber – have not fared well. Those losses are likely to lead to some soul searching amongst Republicans hoping for a successful political message in 2024.
On Thursday, Biden made a point to commend “mainstream Republicans” who lost their elections and accepted defeat, and he also renewed his vow to try to work across the aisle – while also telling Republicans he expected them to do the same.
“I’m prepared to work with Republicans,” Biden said, “but the American people have made it clear they expect Republicans to work with me as well.”
But he repeated that he has some political red lines with Republicans, including threatening to veto any GOP attempts to “repeal the power we just gave Medicare to reduce prescription drug costs,” cuts to Social Security and Medicare, attempts to “walk away from this historic commitment we just made to deal with a climate crisis” and tax cuts for the wealthy.
The president gave much of the credit for the turnout to female voters, saying women “made their voices heard” in the wake of the US Supreme Court decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. And he also credited young people, whose overwhelming turnout appears to have been a large boon for his party.
“Well guess what? Y’all showed up and beat the hell out of them,” Biden remarked.
He added: “Those who support ripping away the right to choose don’t have a clue about the power of women in America, but now I think they do.”
Biden also singled out Vice President Kamala Harris for her focus on reproductive rights, saying, “No one worked harder to get that message across America than this lady right here.”

Donald Trump believes we should terminate “all rules, regulations and articles, even those found in the Constitution” to overturn the 2020 election. That was his view on 1/6 and remains his view today. No honest person can now deny that Trump is an enemy of the Constitution.

 — 
Food is still getting more expensive, but at a slower pace than earlier this year.
In the month of October, food was .6% pricier compared to September, adjusting for seasonal swings, according to data released Thursday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
For the year through October, without seasonal adjustments, food got 10.9% more expensive, with groceries increasing 12.4% and restaurant prices jumping 8.6%.
The increases are less than the record highs clocked just a few months ago, but food prices are still outpacing the overall rate of inflation, which hit 7.7% for the year.
The Federal Reserve has been attempting to curb inflation by raising interest rates, but that doesn’t do much for grocery and restaurant prices.
Egg prices have been especially high this year.

When it comes to food, a number of far-flung factors are disrupting supply.
Extreme heat and drought and a deadly avian flu are hurting some crops, as well as squeezing the supply of turkeys and egg-laying hens. Volatility in the grain market caused by the war in Ukraine as well as high energy prices, which impact fertilizer and transportation costs, are also raising food prices.
“Those things are still problematic,” said Tom Bailey, senior analyst of consumer foods with Rabobank.
Issues like these have led to soaring prices throughout the grocery store.
What’s getting more expensive, and what’s getting cheaper
In the year through October, eggs got a whopping 43% more expensive. Butter went up 26.7%, the price of flour went up 24.6%. Lettuce jumped 17.7%, potatoes popped 15.2% and poultry increased 14.9%. Bread, rice and coffee each went up 14.8%.
A handful of items, however, have seen decreases this year, especially in the meat aisle. Uncooked beef steak fell 6.9%, and beef and veal prices dropped 3.6%.
Some relief for consumers: Prices on a few grocery items are actually coming down
“We’ve seen a little bit of retailer easing of pricing for some of the beef products,” said Bailey. That’s a sign that they are trying to get customers into stores, he noted.
Even as prices cool down, shoppers are still feeling the pain.
“For the consumer, the share of spend of their wallet on food is still well above where we’ve been in the last two decades,” said Bailey.
In October, some prices jumped compared to the previous month.
Eggs saw the highest increase with a 10.1% jump from September. Lunch meats got 3.4% more expensive, lettuce went up 3.3%, tomatoes jumped 2.3% and flour rose 2%.
But several items got less expensive. Fresh fruit fell 2.4%. Uncooked beef roasts and hot dogs both dropped 2.3%, breakfast sausage went down 2% and fresh doughnuts, sweet rolls and coffee cakes fell 1.9%.

Biden says democracy met the test on Election Day
By Maegan Vazquez and Nikki Carvajal, CNN
Published 4:55 PM EST, Thu November 10, 2022

 — 
President Joe Biden said Thursday that democracy met the test on Election Day after warning ahead of the races that the nation’s future would be at stake when Americans cast their ballots earlier this week.
Though neither the US House or Senate majorities have been called for either party, Biden celebrated with fellow Democrats Thursday, touting their ability to stave off the historical headwinds of a dramatic political pendulum swing in Republicans’ favor in the midterm elections.
Speaking to Democratic campaign workers at the Howard Theatre in Washington, DC, Biden called Election Day “a good day for America, a good day for democracy, and … a strong night for Democrats.”
“It was the first national election since January 6 and there were a lot of concerns about whether democracy would meet the test,” the president said. “It did.”
Less than a week before the election, Biden delivered an urgent appeal near Capitol Hill warning that democracy was on the ballot, stating – just blocks from where a mob attempted to interrupt the certification of the 2020 election – that “we can’t take democracy for granted any longer.” Specifically, he called out the “candidates running for every level of office in America – for governor, for Congress, for attorney general, for secretary of state who won’t commit to accepting the results of the elections they’re in.” He also squarely blamed former President Donald Trump for fomenting the wide spread of election misinformation.
As the results of the midterm elections have trickled in this week, Republicans have not seen the dramatic wins they’d hoped would serve as a referendum on Biden’s agenda. Many of Trump’s endorsed candidates in safe Republican seats have won their races, including several election deniers. But Trump’s picks in toss up races – which play a pivotal role in the fate of each chamber – have not fared well. Those losses are likely to lead to some soul searching amongst Republicans hoping for a successful political message in 2024.
On Thursday, Biden made a point to commend “mainstream Republicans” who lost their elections and accepted defeat, and he also renewed his vow to try to work across the aisle – while also telling Republicans he expected them to do the same.
“I’m prepared to work with Republicans,” Biden said, “but the American people have made it clear they expect Republicans to work with me as well.”
But he repeated that he has some political red lines with Republicans, including threatening to veto any GOP attempts to “repeal the power we just gave Medicare to reduce prescription drug costs,” cuts to Social Security and Medicare, attempts to “walk away from this historic commitment we just made to deal with a climate crisis” and tax cuts for the wealthy.
The president gave much of the credit for the turnout to female voters, saying women “made their voices heard” in the wake of the US Supreme Court decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. And he also credited young people, whose overwhelming turnout appears to have been a large boon for his party.
“Well guess what? Y’all showed up and beat the hell out of them,” Biden remarked.
He added: “Those who support ripping away the right to choose don’t have a clue about the power of women in America, but now I think they do.”
Biden also singled out Vice President Kamala Harris for her focus on reproductive rights, saying, “No one worked harder to get that message across America than this lady right here.”

KFC Germany apologizes for advertising a Kristallnacht promotion
By Danielle Wiener-Bronner, CNN Business
Published 12:52 PM EST, Thu November 10, 2022

CNN Business
 — 
KFC Germany apologized for an “unacceptable” message sent to customers on Wednesday, which appeared to tie a sales promotion to the annual commemoration of Kristallnacht.
KFC app users in the country received a message encouraging them to mark the day with crispy chicken and cheese from KFC, according to Twitter users who shared screengrabs of the message in German. The initial message was apparently followed by another, saying the first was an error.
Kristallnacht, often translated as “Night of Broken Glass,” refers to a series of violent raids by the Nazi regime on Jewish businesses, homes and synagogues in 1938.
“Earlier today an automated push notification was accidently [SIC] issued to KFC app users in Germany that contained an obviously unplanned, insensitive and unacceptable message,” KFC Germany said in a statement emailed to CNN Business. “We understand and respect the gravity and history of this day, and remain committed to equity, inclusion and belonging for all.”
“We sincerely apologise,” the statement continued.
KFC Germany didn’t confirm the language used in the alert.
The company explained that it relies on a “semi-automated content creation process linked to calendars that include national observances,” adding that “in this instance, our internal review process was not properly followed, resulting in a non-approved notification being shared.”
KFC Germany said yesterday that it suspended app communications while it put its process under review to make sure something like this doesn’t happen again.
In this case, the company was able to blame an automated system for the mistake. But brands often get their messaging wrong around holidays or memorial days, especially ones that commemorate a painful occasion.
Juneteenth, which marks the end of slavery in the United States, became a federal holiday last year.
Brands rushed to create messages and products for the holiday this year, and many missed the mark. Some relied on racist tropes to mark the occasion and others treated it like a glib celebration, leaving people disappointed and offended.
KFC’s message resulted in similar outrage among some German customers and has been widely criticized on social media.

Home prices rose almost everywhere in the US this summer

In case you needed more evidence of how much home prices have skyrocketed: Even as the housing market was cooling over the summer, prices still rose in 98% of US markets, according to a new report.
From July through September, home prices increased in 181 out of 185 cities tracked by the National Association of Realtors. But the gains had slowed substantially as mortgage rates rose during that time. About half of cities (46%) saw double-digit increases from the year before, down from 80% of cities in the prior quarter.
“Much lower buying capacity has slowed home price growth and the trend will continue until mortgage rates stop rising,” said Lawrence Yun, NAR’s chief economist.
Yun said that because of strong price growth and rising mortgage rates, the median income needed to buy a typical home rose to $88,300 in the third quarter. That’s almost $40,000 more than it was prior to the start of the pandemic.
The average mortgage rate for a 30-year fixed-rate loan during the third quarter – from July to September – was lower than it is now, ranging between 4.99% and 6.70%, according to Freddie Mac. Rates are currently hovering above 7% and expected to go up further as the Federal Reserve continues to take action to rein in inflation.
Where prices rose the most
Prices grew in all parts of the country during the third quarter, but were up the most in the South, rising 11.9% in the third quarter from the year before, according to the report. Prices were up 8.2% in the Northeast, 7.4% in the West, and 6.6% in the Midwest.
Seven of the 10 cities with the biggest year-over-year price jumps were in Florida.
Sarasota, Florida, saw the biggest price jump in the third quarter, up 23.8% from a year earlier. It was followed by the Lakeland and Winter Haven area of Florida, up 21.2% from last year; Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, up by 21.1%; Panama City, Florida, up by 20.5%; and Daytona Beach, Florida, up by 19.6%.
The most expensive markets to buy a home were largely in the West, with half of the top 10 priciest cities in California.
San Jose, California, was the most expensive place to buy a home in the third quarter with the median price hitting $1,688,000, which was up 2.3% from a year before. It was followed by San Francisco, with a median price of $1,300,000; Anaheim, California, at $1,200,000; Honolulu, at $1,127,400; and San Diego, at $900,000.
“The more expensive markets on the West Coast will likely experience some price declines following this rapid price appreciation, which is the result of many years of limited home building,” Yun said. “The Midwest, with relatively affordable home prices, will likely continue to see price gains.”

Twitter executives quit amid company turmoil

He was a famous hacker. Now, he's detailing his main concern with Twitter

 — 
Just days after Twitter laid off thousands of employees, a number of top executives from teams working on privacy and security at the platform have reportedly resigned.
Twitter’s chief information security officer announced their resignation on Thursday, vacating one of the company’s most critical roles just as scrutiny is mounting over Twitter’s future and the erratic decisions of its new owner, Elon Musk.
In a tweet, Lea Kissner, the former CISO, said they were looking forward to figuring out their next steps.
How a 51-year-old celebrity hacker upended one of the world's most influential social networks
“I’ve made the hard decision to leave Twitter,” Kissner tweeted. “I’ve had the opportunity to work with amazing people and I’m so proud of the privacy, security, and IT teams and the work we’ve done.”
Kissner didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment, nor did they publicly offer their reasons for leaving Twitter.
Yoel Roth, Twitter’s head of integrity and safety also resigned from the company on Thursday, according to a source familiar with the situation. In the days following Musk’s acquisition of the company, Roth emerged as a public voice explaining and defending some of the many changes that were being implemented. He joined Musk on a Twitter Spaces discussion on Wednesday to assuage concerns about the platform’s handling of harmful content amid the changes.
Their resignations are the latest example of the internal turmoil that has rocked Twitter following mass layoffs at the company.
Kissner’s departure reportedly coincided with the resignations of multiple other top Twitter leaders Wednesday evening over fears about the company’s legal exposure before the Federal Trade Commission, according to an internal Slack message viewed by CNN. According to the Slack message, Twitter chief privacy officer Damien Kieran resigned on Wednesday evening. Kieran posted a tweet on Thursday evening that appeared to reference his own resignation. The independent journalist Casey Newton and The Verge first reported the resignations.
In the Slack message, a Twitter employee wrote that Musk’s sole priority is “recouping the losses he’s incurring as a result of failing to get out of his binding obligation to buy Twitter.”

The employee’s post also claimed Musk’s focus on monetizing the platform could jeopardize vulnerable users including human rights activists and political dissidents.
It could even put Twitter’s own employees in legal jeopardy, the message suggested, after the employee claimed Musk was unconcerned about Twitter’s potential liability before the FTC.
The employee claimed to have overheard Alex Spiro, Musk’s attorney and, according to the message, Twitter’s new head of legal, saying “Elon puts rockets into space, he’s not afraid of the FTC.” Spiro told CNN that “we are in a continuing dialogue with the FTC and will work closely with the agency to ensure we are in compliance.”
In a statement, a spokesperson for the FTC said it is “tracking recent developments at Twitter with deep concern.”
“No CEO or company is above the law, and companies must follow our consent decrees,” the spokesperson said. “Our revised consent order gives us new tools to ensure compliance, and we are prepared to use them.”
Twitter has twice settled with that agency over user privacy violations, and faces whistleblower allegations from its former head of security, Peiter “Mudge” Zatko, that the company under former CEO Parag Agrawal had violated its FTC obligations a third time. If proven true, Zatko’s allegations could result in billions of dollars in fines and personal liability for Agrawal.
The message outlined plans at Twitter to devolve FTC compliance responsibilities to the individual workers remaining at the company.
“This will put huge amount of personal, professional and legal risk onto engineers,” the message warned, according to The Verge. “I anticipate that all of you will de [sic] pressured by management into pushing out changes that will likely lead to major incidents.”

Because he’s obscenely wealthy people aren’t seeing that this is a dude in the middle of a mental health crisis. 

On the Howard Hughes timeline he’s probably about 10 years away from 6-inch fingernails and drinking his own urine for sustenance.

Donald Trump believes we should terminate “all rules, regulations and articles, even those found in the Constitution” to overturn the 2020 election. That was his view on 1/6 and remains his view today. No honest person can now deny that Trump is an enemy of the Constitution.

Eating disorders have risen in recent years. A new finding may help catch them earlier
By Madeline Holcombe, CNN
Updated 1:10 PM EST, Thu November 10, 2022
The study results suggested that electrolyte levels can help health care professionals identify who might benefit from eating disorder screening, experts said.

 — 
Health care professionals may now have a way to identify possible eating disorder cases a year before they would have been diagnosed, allowing patients to receive support much sooner, according to a new study.
Researchers analyzed provincial health data from Ontario, Canada, for people age 13 and older starting in 2008. The study team tracked participants’ electrolyte levels until 2020 and noted how many were diagnosed with eating disorders, according to the study published Tuesday in JAMA Network Open.
Hospitalizations for eating disorders grew in the pandemic. The problem isn't over, experts say
The results showed that people who experienced electrolyte abnormalities were twice as likely as those who didn’t to be diagnosed with an eating disorder — sometimes more than a year later. And people with severe abnormalities were more than five times as likely to be diagnosed, the study showed.
Abnormal electrolyte levels are common when a person is diagnosed with an eating disorder, said lead study author Dr. Gregory Hundemer, assistant professor of medicine at the University of Ottawa and a nephrologist at the Ottawa Hospital.
EATING DISORDER RESOURCES
US: National Eating Disorder Association
The NEDA has a confidential, toll free helpline at 800-931-2237 as well as an online click-to-chat service. For 24/7 crisis support, text “NEDA” to 741-741.
The NEDA also has a list of recommended websites and free or low-cost resources.
US: National Association of Anorexia Nervosa and Associated Disorders
ANAD runs a helpline at 888-375-7767 from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. CT and provides links to support groups and treatment providers.
Australia: National Eating Disorders Collaboration
A call center at 800-334-673 and online chat run by the Butterfly Foundation is open 8 a.m. to midnight AET every day except public holidays.
UK: Beat Eating Disorders
Helplines for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are open 9 a.m. to midnight weekdays and 4 p.m. to midnight weekends, every day of the year.
Electrolytes — important minerals such as potassium, phosphate and magnesium — can be thrown off by dehydration, restrictive diets, vomiting and use of laxatives, all of which may be symptomatic of an eating disorder, said Dr. Jason Nagata, assistant professor of pediatrics at the University of California, San Francisco. Nagata was not involved in this study.
Disordered eating patterns are often present well before a person is diagnosed, which is why the researchers hypothesized that electrolyte levels might be a good indicator of who might develop an eating disorder, Hundemer said.
“This study raised the concern that electrolyte abnormalities may be a red flag for more screening much earlier into the course of an eating disorder than we might think,” said Dr. Sydney Hartman-Munick, assistant professor of pediatrics at the University of Massachusetts Chan Medical School. Hartman-Munick was not involved in the study.
“We know that timely screening, diagnosis and treatment predict better prognosis for patients with eating disorders, and the study introduces the idea that electrolyte abnormalities may be a red flag that could lead to further evaluation, especially in the primary care setting,” Hartman-Munick added.
Early signs of eating disorders
Abnormal electrolyte levels can be life threatening, and eating disorders have risen since the pandemic started, Nagata said. From the spring of 2020 — when most Covid-19 restrictions/lockdowns were first put in place — through spring 2021, the number of eating disorder inpatient admissions in young adults and adolescents about doubled, according to a recent study.
This latest study on electrolyte abnormalities shows there is a potential for faster intervention, Hundemer said.

Many of the abnormalities were noted more than a year before diagnosis, and in that time, patients might be directed to more targeted screenings for eating disorders, he added.
“There is still so much we don’t know about the best methods for prevention and early detection for eating disorders, and this study offers new insight into future study in this area,” Hartman-Munick said.
Eating disorders are underrecognized and undertreated, especially among men, the LGBTQ community, people of color, older adults and those with larger bodies, Nagata said.
Health care providers should be aware of the risk that may come with abnormal electrolyte levels and the warning signs of an eating disorder — which include fasting, severe caloric restriction, vomiting, or using laxatives or diuretics to lose weight, he said.
'I couldn't stop.' The pandemic is triggering eating disorders in our children
If you are concerned about your weight loss behaviors — including vomiting, laxatives or diuretic use — you should talk with your health care provider about checking electrolyte levels, Nagata added.
Families of teens and adolescents who are showing signs of eating disorders should raise concerns with a health care provider, Nagata said. The professional can assess for an eating disorder and refer families to helpful resources, he added.
If you think someone you know might be struggling with an eating disorder, you can also call the National Eating Disorders Association helpline (800-931-2237) for guidance on how to provide support.

 — 
As midterm results continue to roll in days after Election Day, Democratic and Republican candidates have already been celebrating historic victories.
Heading into Election Day, both parties were looking to diversify their ranks of elected officials, both in Congress and beyond, and they appear on track to do so.
House Republicans will add new members of color to their conference, including John James, who will be the first Black Republican congressman from Michigan, and Juan Ciscomani, who will be the first Latino Republican to represent Arizona in Congress.
Democrats will make a breakthrough for LGBTQ representation in governor’s offices. In Massachusetts and Oregon, Democrats Maura Healey and Tina Kotek will become the nation’s first out lesbian governors.
Republican Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the former Trump White House press secretary, will be the first female governor of Arkansas. And Maryland Democrat Wes Moore will be the state’s first Black governor.
There are still several races that have not yet been called. But for now, here’s a look at the candidates who CNN projects will make history in the 2022 midterms.
This list will be updated as more winners are projected.
Alabama

AL-SEN: Republican Katie Britt will be the first elected female senator from Alabama, CNN projects, winning an open-seat race to succeed her onetime boss, retiring GOP Sen. Richard Shelby. Britt is a former CEO of the Business Council of Alabama and was the heavy favorite in the general election in the deep-red state. Two women have previously represented Alabama in the Senate, but both were appointed to fill vacancies.
Arizona
AZ-06: Juan Ciscomani will be the first Latino Republican elected to Congress from Arizona, CNN projects, winning election to the state’s 6th Congressional District. Ciscomani, who was born in Mexico and immigrated to the US with his family as a child, previously worked at the Tucson Hispanic Chamber of Commerce and was a senior adviser to Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey.
Arkansas

AR-GOV: Republican Sarah Huckabee Sanders will be the first woman elected governor of Arkansas, CNN projects, winning the office her father previously held for over a decade. Sanders, who earned a national profile in her role as press secretary in the Trump White House, is also the first daughter in US history to serve as governor of the same state her father once led.
AR-LG: Republican Leslie Rutledge will be the first woman elected lieutenant governor of Arkansas, CNN projects. Rutledge, the state attorney general, originally sought the open governor’s seat but switched to the lieutenant governor’s race after Sanders entered the GOP gubernatorial primary. Lieutenant governors are elected on separate tickets in Arkansas.
With the election of Sanders and Rutledge, Arkansas will join Massachusetts as the first states to have women serving concurrently as governor and lieutenant governor.
California
CA-SEN: Democrat Alex Padilla will be the first elected Latino senator from California, CNN projects, winning a special election for the remainder of Kamala Harris’ term as well as an election for a full six-year term. Padilla, the son of Mexican immigrant parents, was appointed by California Gov. Gavin Newsom to the seat Harris vacated when she became vice president.
CA-SOS: Democrat Shirley Weber will be California’s first elected Black secretary of state of state, CNN projects. Weber, a former state assemblywoman, has been serving in the position since last year after Newsom picked her to succeed Padilla, who was appointed to the US Senate.
CA-AG: Democrat Rob Bonta will be California’s first elected Filipino American attorney general, CNN projects. Bonta, who was born in the Philippines and immigrated with his family to the US as an infant, has been serving in the position since last year after Newsom appointed him to succeed Xavier Becerra, who left to become President Joe Biden’s Health and Human Services secretary.
CA-42: Democrat Robert Garcia will be the first out LGBTQ immigrant elected to Congress, CNN projects, winning election to California’s 42nd Congressional District. Garcia, who immigrated from Lima, Peru, in the early 1980s at the age of 5, is the current mayor of Long Beach.
Los Angeles Mayor: Democrat Karen Bass will be the first woman and the first Black woman elected mayor of Los Angeles, CNN projects. Bass, who currently represents a Los Angeles-area House seat, will defeat real estate developer Rick Caruso. Bass was on Joe Biden’s short list for a running mate in the 2020 campaign. She’s no stranger to making history: She previously served in the California State Assembly, where in 2008 she became the first Black woman to serve as speaker of a state legislature.
Bass said on November 17, the day after her race was called, that the accomplishment of becoming the first female mayor of Los Angeles and the magnitude of the job was “sinking in.”
“To me, when you do make history, when you’re in a position like this – and I was in a similar position when I was sworn in as speaker – it means that you have extra responsibility. You always have to make sure that you maintain excellence in every step of the way,” she said. “The path that you go is laying the foundation for those that come behind you.”
Colorado
CO-08: Democrat Yadira Caraveo will be the first Latina elected to Congress from Colorado, CNN projects, winning the race for the state’s new 8th Congressional District. Caraveo, a state representative and the daughter of Mexican immigrant parents, will defeat Republican state Sen. Barbara Kirkmeyer to win the seat located north of Denver.
Connecticut
CT-SOS: Democrat Stephanie Thomas will be the first Black woman elected secretary of state of Connecticut, CNN projects. Thomas, a member of the Connecticut House, will succeed appointed Democratic incumbent Mark Kohler.
Florida

The 25-year-old representative-elect told CNN’s Poppy Harlow on November 9 that when President Joe Biden called to congratulate him, the President recalled being too young to be sworn in as a senator when he was first elected at age 29.
“He asked me if it was the same situation. I said, ‘No, Mr. President, you had me beat on that. I’m already old enough to be sworn in on January 3.’ So, it was great to talk with him. You know, he was elected at a very young age, too, so he understands that experience,” Frost said on “CNN This Morning.”
Frost, who made reducing gun violence a central part of his campaign, also told CNN that he will work to pass universal background checks in Washington.

New Jersey man accused of sending online threats to attack a synagogue and Jewish people, federal prosecutor says
By Ray Sanchez and Kristina Sgueglia, CNN

CNN
 — 
An 18-year-old New Jersey man was arrested Thursday after sending a manifesto online with threats to attack a synagogue and Jewish people, federal prosecutors say.
Omar Alkattoul, a Sayreville resident, is charged with a count of transmitting a threat in interstate and foreign commerce earlier this month, according to a criminal complaint and a statement from Philip Sellinger, US Attorney for the District of New Jersey.
Alkattoul appeared Thursday afternoon before US Magistrate Judge Jessica Allen in Newark and was detained without bail. He was not asked to enter a plea. CNN has reached out to his public defender for comment.
Alkattoul faces a maximum penalty of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine if convicted, according to prosecutors.
“No one should be targeted for violence or with acts of hate because of how they worship,” Sellinger said in the statement. “According to the complaint, this defendant used social media to send a manifesto containing a threat to attack a synagogue based on his hatred of Jews.”
FBI identifies source of New Jersey synagogues threat who 'no longer poses a danger to the community'
Court documents allege Alkattoul on November 1 sent via social media a link to a document titled “When Swords Collide” and told another person he authored the manifesto “in the context of an attack on Jews.”
“I am the attacker and I would like to introduce myself,” the suspect wrote, according to court documents.
In the document Alkattoul wrote he “did target a synagogue for a really good reason” and said “the motive of this attack is hatred towards Jews and their heinous acts,” according to the complaint.
The suspect shared the document with several people via an unnamed social media application, authorities said. One of those people informed law enforcement.
Alkattoul told authorities he wrote the document while “live action role playing” and “imagined being al-Qaeda and carrying out an attack,” according to the complaint.
After being interviewed by law enforcement, Alkattoul was voluntarily transferred to a hospital for an examination, the complaint said.
At the hospital, the complaint alleges, the suspect told an employee he had been communicating on social media “with someone he believed to be in al-Qaeda” who he told of his plan to eventually “blow up a synagogue.”
CNN reported earlier this month about the broad threat to synagogues in New Jersey, and that an online antisemitic post in a forum frequented by extremists had prompted an FBI alert.
Authorities were alarmed because the post was written as if an attack had already occurred, according to sources. It factored significantly into the urgency of locating the suspect and also releasing the broad warning to the Jewish community, sources said.
The FBI in Newark tweeted on November 3 it had received “credible information of a broad threat to synagogues” in the state.
While no specific target, timing or plan was mentioned, the nature of the post created enough concern that the FBI decided to issue a general warning out of an abundance of caution.
Over the past few years, antisemitic incidents have risen in the US, with 942 incidents in 2015 jumping to 2,717 tracked in 2021 by the Anti-Defamation League.
CNN’s John Miller, Nicki Brown, Rob Frehse and Christina Maxouris contributed to this report.

Homes are collapsing into the ocean in Florida. Here’s what’s behind the dangerous situation

'We are in trouble here in Daytona': Coastal homes collapse into the ocean

CNN
 — 
Homes and buildings are collapsing into the ocean and authorities have issued warnings to evacuate some areas as Tropical Storm Nicole pushes a huge volume of ocean water onshore in southeast Florida.
Video from Volusia County shows homes crumbling, reduced to wreckage, as Nicole’s waves erode the coastline. Separate video shows the county’s beach safety office collapsing into the rising water.
“Right now, ground zero is here,” Volusia County Sheriff Mike Chitwood told CNN affiliate WESH-TV on Wednesday as Nicole came ashore as a category 1 hurricane.
A Wilbur-by-the-Sea beachside home was left on the edge of a sandy cliff Wednesday after rough surf and storm surge caused by Tropical Storm Nicole washed away about 20 feet of sand.
WKMG
A bricked area outside the home partially washed away, with just inches of sand left between the house and the beach below.
WESH
Three main factors are contributing to the dangerous situation on the coast.
Nicole’s storm surge, which peaked at around 6 feet Thursday morning, is significant because of how massive the storm was as it approached Florida on Wednesday, with tropical-storm-force winds stretching for more than 500 miles.
That storm surge pushed ashore on top of exceptionally high tides associated with this week’s full moon.
And behind it all, sea level in this part of Florida has risen more than a foot in the past 100 years, according to data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and most of that rise has occurred in the past three decades.

Scientists and researchers have long warned that sea level rise is leading to more erosion and high-tide flooding — particularly during extreme coastal storms. This is putting even more stress on sea walls, which are meant to protect coastal communities from high waves and water levels.
“We do gradually put more stress on [sea walls] with sea level rise,” Brian McNoldy, a senior research associate at the University of Miami’s School of Marine and Atmospheric Science, told CNN. “More and more of them are gradually, completely submerged in saltwater, which concrete does not like.”
McNoldy also noted that these walls are aging, and the back-to-back nature of storms is making seawalls more vulnerable. It was only six weeks ago that Hurricane Ian’s storm surge eroded parts of Florida’s eastern coast.
“It doesn’t really take a strong storm – you just need high tides or storm-agitated tides to wash away or put extra stress on the walls,” he said. “Having these two storms six weeks apart, if you don’t give places any time to repair or replenish, each storm definitely leaves its mark.”
Sea level rise is putting more coastal homes at risk to storm surge, high tides and large waves.
WKMG
Many coastal communities in the US experience nuisance flooding, or high-tide flooding, on a regular basis. Higher sea levels, caused by warmer water temperatures and melting glaciers and ice sheets, increase the hazards coastal residents are exposed to.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported in 2019 that by 2050, the United States will experience 25 to 75 days of high-tide flooding.
Additionally, hurricane storm surge is creeping higher, and homes and other critical infrastructure are now exposed to saltwater and erosion that they weren’t a few decades ago.

CNN
 — 
Alan Jackson was presented with the Willie Nelson Lifetime Achievement Award at the 56th Annual Country Music Association Awards on Wednesday.
In his acceptance speech, the country music legend told the crowd at the Bridgestone Arena in Nashville, Tennessee, that “Country music has been real good to me and I fell in love with it when I was a young man.”
“I really love the instruments, the steel guitars and the fiddles and things like that that gave it such a unique character to me and made it its own,” the musician said. “And I love the lyrics and the songs and the artists and the melodies and the harmonies. It’s just a real American music to me.”
Jackson, known for several hits including “It’s Five O’Clock Somewhere,” also thanked his wife Denise saying, “We started out as teenagers and she’s been on this roller coaster ride with me for 40 something years now.”
He added that he’s “not always the easiest person to love, but she’s hung in there and helped me through hard times and we share great times. The good and the bad, the happy and the sad. We’ve survived a lot.”
The Willie Nelson Lifetime Achievement Award recognizes artists who have contributed to country music in a significant way and have positively impacted the music genre.
Jackson has also been named CMA entertainer of the year three times.

New Webb telescope image shows ‘lonely’ dwarf galaxy in striking detail

CNN
 — 
The James Webb Space Telescope has snapped a remarkably detailed image of a nearby dwarf galaxy. The near-infrared view reveals the deepest glimpse yet into a stellar panorama that could offer astronomers an ideal means of studying aspects of the early universe.
The image shows a panoply of stars within a lonely dwarf galaxy called Wolf - Lundmark - Melotte, which lies about 3 million light-years from our home galaxy, the Milky Way, and is about one-tenth the size.
Ghostly figures emerge from Pillars of Creation in new Webb telescope image
The WLM galaxy is intriguing to astronomers because it has remained largely isolated and bears a similar chemical makeup to galaxies in the early universe, according to NASA.
The Webb telescope, which launched in December 2021, is the most powerful space observatory to date. It’s capable of detecting the faint light of incredibly distant galaxies as they glow in infrared light, a wavelength invisible to the human eye.
The Hubble Space Telescope and the now-defunct Spitzer Space Telescope have imaged the WLM galaxy, but Webb used its Near-Infrared Camera, also called NIRCam, to capture it in unprecedented detail.
“We can see a myriad of individual stars of different colors, sizes, temperatures, ages, and stages of evolution; interesting clouds of nebular gas within the galaxy; foreground stars with Webb’s diffraction spikes; and background galaxies with neat features like tidal tails,” said Kristen McQuinn, an assistant professor in the department of physics and astronomy at Rutgers University in Piscataway, New Jersey, in a comment posted on NASA’s website. A tidal tail is a thin “tail” of stars and interstellar gas extending off a galaxy.
“It’s really a gorgeous image,” added McQuinn, who is one of the lead scientists on the Webb Early Release Science program.
On Twitter, NASA’s official Webb telescope account declared that, compared with past space observatory images, Webb’s NIRCam image “makes the whole place shimmer” — a reference to the song “Bejeweled” on Taylor Swift’s new album, “Midnights.”
Some of the stars pictured in this latest Webb image are low-mass stars that were formed in the early universe and are able to survive for billions of years, McQuinn noted on NASA’s site.
“By determining the properties of these low-mass stars (like their ages), we can gain insight into what was happening in the very distant past,” she said.

A Texas woman found guilty of killing a pregnant woman to take her unborn child has been sentenced to death

 — 
A Texas woman convicted of killing a pregnant woman and then taking her unborn baby, who also died, has been sentenced to death, court records show.
A Bowie County jury last month after about an hour of deliberations found Taylor Rene Parker guilty of capital murder in the deaths of Reagan Michelle Simmons and her baby, the district attorney’s office previously said. The same jury was then tasked with choosing her sentence – death or prison without parole.
The jury handed down the death sentence Wednesday, online court records show.
“Based on the strong defense case we put on at sentencing, we are disappointed in the verdict, but we respect the jury’s findings after a long, factually and emotionally difficult trial,” Parker’s attorney, Jeff Harrelson, said.
With her death sentence, Parker becomes one of just seven women on Texas’ death row, according to statistics from the Texas Department of Criminal Justice.
According to a probable cause affidavit, Parker had told her boyfriend and others she was pregnant, held a gender reveal party and on October 9, 2020, said she was going to a hospital in Idabel, Oklahoma, to preregister for labor to be induced.
Jury finds Texas woman guilty of killing pregnant woman to take her unborn child
That same morning, police in New Boston, Texas, west of Texarkana, received a 911 call from a woman who reported someone had killed her daughter, the affidavit said. Responding officers found Simmons, who they learned had been 34 weeks pregnant, with a large cut along her abdomen and the baby no longer in her womb.
Texas state troopers conducted a traffic stop of a car that morning and found Parker holding a baby in her lap and “the umbilical cord was connected to the infant, which appeared to be coming out of the female’s pants, as if she gave birth to the child,” the affidavit said.
Parker and the baby were taken to the hospital in Idabel, where hospital staff determined Parker had not given birth to the child. Parker then admitted to being in a “physical altercation” with the victim and abducting the unborn baby from the victim’s body.
Authorities determined Parker caused the deaths of both Simmons and her baby “due to the inability to provide necessary care to the child,” the affidavit said.
“We are just so thankful justice has been served today, for not only our family, our friends, the prosecution team, our community,” Jessica Brooks, the mother of the victim, told CNN affiliate KSLA, which reported the sentencing trial lasted 25 days and included 142 witnesses.
According to the station, prosecutors argued for death, saying Parker would not change, while the defense, in seeking the provide jurors with context from Parker’s life, said she had traumatic issues that had not been addressed.
“I’m overwhelmed with happiness it’s over,” the victim’s sister Emily Simmons said, per KSLA, “because (Parker) has been such a burden in our life for so long now that I haven’t been able to think about my sister without thinking about her.”

 — 
In 2019, Air Company made a splash when it launched vodka derived from recaptured carbon, in an effort to reduce the amount of the harmful greenhouse gas in the atmosphere.
Today, the Brooklyn-based startup has begun using the same process to make fuel for airplanes.
Air Company’s sustainable aviation fuel, which was recently tested by the US Air Force, could ultimately help the airline industry hit its goal of net zero carbon emissions by 2050. Currently, the airline industry accounts for about 3% of total global carbon emissions each year, and mostly relies on traditional, fossil-based fuels that require various forms of environmental disruption to produce.
Gravity could solve renewable energy's biggest problem
Already, some of the world’s biggest airlines are signing on to Air Company’s vision. The company announced last month that Jet Blue and Virgin Atlantic, as well as startup aircraft company Boom Supersonic, have agreed to purchase millions of gallons of its fuel in the coming years. Jet Blue Ventures, the airline’s investment arm, also invested directly in Air Company’s $30 million Series A funding round earlier this year.
Air Company's carbon-neutral, CO2-derived fuel was successfully used in August 2022 during a test flight in partnership with the US Air Force.
Air Company
“How we think about what the company does is trying to solve humanity’s toughest problems,” Gregory Constantine, co-founder and CEO of Air Company, told CNN in an interview last month. “For us, climate change is the greatest challenge that we’re facing as humanity to date … so if we can work on technologies that take what was once really thought of as a problem and turn it into a solution, then that’s a massive win.”
A number of producers of sustainable aviation fuel have emerged in recent years, including a major Finnish producer called Neste, many of them using ingredients such as plant material and cooking oil. But Air Company’s production process starts by pulling harmful carbon emissions out of the air.
The company first harvests carbon, mostly from industrial settings such as biofuel production facilities. It then takes water, separates the hydrogen from the oxygen, and blends the captured carbon with the hydrogen and a proprietary mix of other compounds, according to Air Company CTO Stafford Sheehan. It then distills that solution down, using what looks like a larger version of, say, a whiskey distilling system. The final products are ethyl alcohol, which is used to make the company’s vodka and other products such as perfume, as well as paraffin, which forms the basis of its jet fuel.
These 'flying' ferries could get you to work in half the time
In some ways, Sheehan said, the process mimics how plants work: It takes in carbon, and aside from the final products, the only other offput is oxygen. And the company says its tests have indicated that planes should be able to fly using its fuel without blending it with fossil-based fuels or modifying their engines.
By the time a plane has flown using Air Company’s fuel, it will have released the same amount of carbon dioxide back into the atmosphere as was captured to make the fuel, meaning the process on the whole is carbon-neutral, Sheehan said. The company uses renewable energy sources like solar to power its production facility.
Air Company does still have some work to do until its carbon-derived fuel is ready to be used widely on commercial flights. It needs more testing, and it needs to grow its manufacturing footprint. Sheehan said the company’s next production facility is already in the works and will be about 100 times the size of its Brooklyn test facility, which is probably about the size of a two-bedroom New York City apartment.
Air Company was founded in 2019 by Gregory Constantine and Dr. Stafford Sheehan.
Air Company
The company will also need to bring down the cost of its fuel, which is currently more expensive than traditional jet fuels, although the company declined to provide details on just how much. Air Company said that “consumers will not feel the impact of this shift,” and added that lowering the cost will be achieved in part “through an array of government incentives made available to fuel producers generating sustainable alternatives.”
Constantine said the company is planning for the first test of its fuel on a commercial plane next year, and expects to have its fuel used on its first commercial passenger flight by 2024.
Still, Air Company is hopeful that its efforts could eventually disrupt the aviation industry for the better, just as it’s been working to do with its consumer goods.
“Aviation has been a part of the goal since the start,” he said. “However, to get to those, you know, large industrial markets like aviation fuel, which it is traditionally known as the hottest industry industries to decarbonize, is going to take time. It’s going to take a lot of money and a lot of effort.”

 — 
Just days after Twitter laid off thousands of employees, a number of top executives from teams working on privacy and security at the platform have reportedly resigned.
Twitter’s chief information security officer announced their resignation on Thursday, vacating one of the company’s most critical roles just as scrutiny is mounting over Twitter’s future and the erratic decisions of its new owner, Elon Musk.
In a tweet, Lea Kissner, the former CISO, said they were looking forward to figuring out their next steps.
How a 51-year-old celebrity hacker upended one of the world's most influential social networks
“I’ve made the hard decision to leave Twitter,” Kissner tweeted. “I’ve had the opportunity to work with amazing people and I’m so proud of the privacy, security, and IT teams and the work we’ve done.”
Kissner didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment, nor did they publicly offer their reasons for leaving Twitter.
Yoel Roth, Twitter’s head of integrity and safety also resigned from the company on Thursday, according to a source familiar with the situation. In the days following Musk’s acquisition of the company, Roth emerged as a public voice explaining and defending some of the many changes that were being implemented. He joined Musk on a Twitter Spaces discussion on Wednesday to assuage concerns about the platform’s handling of harmful content amid the changes.
Their resignations are the latest example of the internal turmoil that has rocked Twitter following mass layoffs at the company.
Kissner’s departure reportedly coincided with the resignations of multiple other top Twitter leaders Wednesday evening over fears about the company’s legal exposure before the Federal Trade Commission, according to an internal Slack message viewed by CNN. According to the Slack message, Twitter chief privacy officer Damien Kieran resigned on Wednesday evening. Kieran posted a tweet on Thursday evening that appeared to reference his own resignation. The independent journalist Casey Newton and The Verge first reported the resignations.
In the Slack message, a Twitter employee wrote that Musk’s sole priority is “recouping the losses he’s incurring as a result of failing to get out of his binding obligation to buy Twitter.”
Lea Kissner, Twitter's chief information security officer, announced their resignation from the company on Thursday.

The employee’s post also claimed Musk’s focus on monetizing the platform could jeopardize vulnerable users including human rights activists and political dissidents.
It could even put Twitter’s own employees in legal jeopardy, the message suggested, after the employee claimed Musk was unconcerned about Twitter’s potential liability before the FTC.
The employee claimed to have overheard Alex Spiro, Musk’s attorney and, according to the message, Twitter’s new head of legal, saying “Elon puts rockets into space, he’s not afraid of the FTC.” Spiro told CNN that “we are in a continuing dialogue with the FTC and will work closely with the agency to ensure we are in compliance.”
In a statement, a spokesperson for the FTC said it is “tracking recent developments at Twitter with deep concern.”
“No CEO or company is above the law, and companies must follow our consent decrees,” the spokesperson said. “Our revised consent order gives us new tools to ensure compliance, and we are prepared to use them.”
Twitter has twice settled with that agency over user privacy violations, and faces whistleblower allegations from its former head of security, Peiter “Mudge” Zatko, that the company under former CEO Parag Agrawal had violated its FTC obligations a third time. If proven true, Zatko’s allegations could result in billions of dollars in fines and personal liability for Agrawal.
The message outlined plans at Twitter to devolve FTC compliance responsibilities to the individual workers remaining at the company.
“This will put huge amount of personal, professional and legal risk onto engineers,” the message warned, according to The Verge. “I anticipate that all of you will de [sic] pressured by management into pushing out changes that will likely lead to major incidents.”

Donald Trump believes we should terminate “all rules, regulations and articles, even those found in the Constitution” to overturn the 2020 election. That was his view on 1/6 and remains his view today. No honest person can now deny that Trump is an enemy of the Constitution.

 — 
At least two people have died during the damage wrought by Nicole’s overnight landfall Thursday along Florida’s eastern shore, which knocked out power to thousands, pushed buildings near collapse and flooded the coast as the first hurricane to hit the United States in November in nearly 40 years.
Two people were “electrocuted by a downed power line” in Orange County, the Orange County Sheriff’s Office said in a press release.
A tornado threat, plus powerful wind and heavy rain, are expected to continue Thursday in parts of Florida, Georgia and South Carolina after Nicole, which hit at Category 1 strength, weakened to a tropical depression. All tropical storm and storm surge warnings have however been discontinued.

Meanwhile, communities are assessing the damage.
At least 49 beachfront buildings including 24 hotels and condos have been deemed “unsafe” following Hurricane Nicole in Volusia County, officials said in a press release. “The structural damage along our coastline is unprecedented,” county manager George Recktenwald said in the release. “We have never experienced anything like this before, so we ask for your patience as we make our assessments.
An additional 11 structures on Daytona Beach shores have already been deemed compromised, according to Recktenwald.
Volusia County officials have “declared a curfew in incorporated and unincorporated areas east of the Intracoastal Waterway from 11:22 a.m. Thursday, Nov. 10, through 7 a.m. Friday, Nov. 11,” said a Volusia County storm update.
Two hundred residents were housed in county shelters, said the update. Three shelters remain open. Roughly 23,000 customers are without power in the county, according to PowerOutage.us.

In Indian River County, officials Thursday morning will “be assessing debris and messaging cleanup plans,” said spokesperson Kathy Copeland. In St. Lucie County, there were so far “no serious reports of damages or injuries,” spokesperson Erick Gill said, adding, “Most likely the biggest impact is going to be beach erosion.”

At 10 p.m. ET Thursday, Nicole was packing 35-mph sustained winds and centered about 20 miles north of Tallahassee, moving northwest at 15 mph.
Up to 8 inches of rain could drench eastern, central and northern portions of Florida through Saturday. And between 2 to 6 inches are expected from parts of the US southeast to the southern and central Appalachians and western mid-Atlantic, the hurricane center said.
Nicole weakened to a tropical storm shortly after landfall, and then became a depression late Thursday. It’s expected to become a post-tropical cyclone over the Southeast.
Here’s what to know now:
Residents outside Florida should now prepare: There are nearly three million people under a tornado watch issued for southeast Georgia, eastern and southern South Carolina and portions of far southern North Carolina. “Given the uncertainty of the storm’s strength and path as it approaches South Carolina, residents need to have their personal emergency plans ready to go just in case we need to take safety precautions later in the week,” said Kim Stenson, who heads the state’s emergency management division.
Tens of thousands without power: More than 237,000 homes and businesses in Florida were without power late Thursday, according to PowerOutage.us.
Low tide limits storm surge: Nicole’s peak winds coincided with low tide, limiting the storm surge and inundation on the shore. At Port Canaveral, the surge was measured at just under 6 feet around 4 a.m. ET, just after landfall. Later Thursday morning, surge was down to around 3 feet, but water levels are expected to remain high through high tide, between 8 a.m. and 10 a.m.
Nicole's storm surge pushes Wednesday into East Boynton Beach in Florida.
FB/Boynton Beach Police Department
King Tide puts structures at risk: The King Tide that affected Volusia County Thursday morning “is of great concern for potentially further damage to structures,” said officials with Volusia County Emergency Management. King Tides is a term used to describe higher than normal tidal cycles that typically occur during a new moon or a full moon when the moon makes its closest pass to the Earth. When they coincide with bad weather including heavy rain, winds and waves, they can cause severe flooding. Because of rising sea levels, King Tides are becoming more frequent and severe.
Flights canceled and schools closed: The storm’s colossal path led to the closure of many schools, colleges and universities, as well as the cancellation of hundreds of flights and the shuttering of amusement parks. Orlando International Airport halted operations Wednesday afternoon, and Miami International Airport warned of cancellations but did not plan to close.
Historic hurricane: Nicole’s landfall Thursday was the latest in a calendar year a hurricane has ever struck Florida’s Atlantic coast. It broke the record set by the Yankee Hurricane, which hit Florida’s east coast on November 4, 1935.
Where the storm hit: The storm struck just south of Vero Beach with winds of 75 mph before quickly weakening, the National Hurricane Center said. Its strong winds, downpours and storm surge thrashed some areas hit in September by Hurricane Ian. Nicole on Wednesday brought strong winds and dangerous storm surge to the northwestern Bahamas.

Record-breaking sale of Microsoft co-founder's art collection surpasses $1.6 billion
Updated 10th November 2022

Written by
Jacqui Palumbo, CNN
Oscar Holland, CNN
This article has been updated following the conclusion of the auction's second part.
Art from the private collection of late Microsoft co-founder Paul G. Allen fetched over $1.6 billion this week to become the largest single-owner sale in auction history.
Works by Georges Seurat, Paul Cézanne, Vincent van Gogh, Paul Gauguin and Gustav Klimt all sold for over $100 million across a record-shattering two nights at Christie's in New York.
Spanning 500 years of art history, art from Allen's collection was offered on Wednesday and Thursday, with all proceeds going to philanthropic causes, the auction house said. Christie's had initially estimated that the 150-plus works would sell for a combined $1 billion, but the landmark sum was exceeded even before the conclusion of day one.
Art explained: How do art auctions really work?
Works by contemporary artists Jasper Johns and Lucian Freud were also among the record-breakers on Wednesday, which saw sales in excess of 1.5 billion. Paintings by Edward Hopper, Georgia O'Keeffe and Jackson Pollock were among dozens more that went under the hammer on day two to add a further $115.9 million to the total.
The auction's single biggest sale was Seurat's ""Les Poseuses, Ensemble (Petite version),"" pictured above, which fetched over $149.2 million — almost five times the previous record for the French artist's work.
Cézanne's ""La Montagne Sainte-Victoire"" attracted the sale's second biggest sale price, fetching almost $137.8 million. Credit: Christie's
Elsewhere, Cézanne's oil on canvas ""La Montagne Sainte-Victoire,"" one of more than 30 views he painted of the French mountain range, sold for almost $137.8 million. Allen acquired the famed alpine scene in 2001 for $35 million, then the second-highest price paid for a Cézanne at auction, according to Max Carter, a vice chairman of 20th and 21st century art at Christie's.
Only five of the painter's views of Sainte-Victoire are left in private hands, Carter added. ""Each one is from a slightly different vantage point. Most of them are slightly further back,"" he told CNN in an interview prior to the sale. ""It's also rare that it's... not obscured by any trees in front of the mountain.""
""Verger avec cyprès"" is now the most expensive Van Gogh painting ever to sell at auction. Credit: Christie's
A Van Gogh painting, ""Verger avec cyprès,"" meanwhile fetched almost $117.2 million to become the most expensive work by the artist ever to sell at auction. Painted in Arles, France, two years before the artist's death, it is ""as special as any Van Gogh we've offered in 30 years,"" according to Carter.
""This is when his color has become unmoored from reality and is dictated by imagination,"" Carter said. Out of the orchard series, ""only five are in private hands,"" he added. ""The vast majority are in museums.""
The two other artworks to attract nine-figure bids were Gauguin's ""Maternité II,"" which fetched $105.7 million, and Klimt's ""Birch Forest,"" a large-scale landscape that sold for over $104.5 million.

Showing a dappled wood scene on the outskirts of Vienna, and painted in Klimt's romantic Art Nouveau style, the latter artwork is ""almost like a fairy tale,"" Carter said. The sale set a new auction record for the Austrian artist a decade and a half after it was part of a landmark sale that included five Klimt masterpieces once looted by Nazis.
The man on the phone: What's it like making history's highest auction bid?
The Gauguin painting also smashed a previous auction record for the artist's work (though one sold at a private sale in 2015 reportedly sold upwards of $300 million). Allen bought the canvas, which has religious overtones in its mother-and-child composition, in 2004 for a then-record $39 million.
It was painted during Gauguin's 10-year stint in French Polynesia, a period of his life that is rife with controversy (he fathered a child with a teenager there) but that produced paintings that are still highly sought-after.
""Most of the paintings or drawings that come up (for sale) tend to be from earlier periods in his life,"" Carter said.

Contemporary masters
After spending several decades assembling his collection, Allen lent works to museums around the world, including The National Gallery and Royal Academy of Arts in London and The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.
The exhibition ""Seeing Nature,"" based on his collection, toured the US in 2016 and 2017 with stops at the Seattle Museum of Art and Minneapolis Institute of Arts, among others. Allen died in 2018 from non-Hodgkin's lymphoma at age 65.
Art explained: How do you fall in love with art?
""(Allen) was collecting all the way up until the year that he passed away,"" Johanna Flaum, a vice chairman of 20th and 21st century art at Christie's, told CNN ahead of the sale.
While most of Wednesday's biggest sellers date back to the 19th century, contemporary masterpieces also attracted record-breaking sums.
A 1980s work by British painter Lucian Freud, ""Large Interior, W11 (after Watteau),"" sold for $86 million, shattering the artist's previous record of $56.2 million. Allen acquired the painting in 1998 for $5.8 million, around 15 years after Freud completed it.

The painting, which has been widely exhibited around the world, took two years for Freud to complete. It was modeled after the figures in French artist Jean-Antoine Watteau's ""Les Jaloux (The Jealous Ones)"" from the early 18th century. But Freud populated his swirling interior scene with his own loved ones.
""(It) has largely been regarded, since the time it was painted, as being Freud's very best painting,"" Flaum said.
Rare portrait by Francis Bacon fetches $52.8 million at auction
""The painting includes a compilation of those that were the closest to Freud: a current lover, ex-lover, (his) children,"" she explained. ""His world is encapsulated in the figures, so it's quite personal.""
Elsewhere, a total of six works by Jasper Johns, the prolific American artist who mounted a two-city retrospective in New York and Philadelphia last year, were offered for sale across the two nights. On Wednesday ""Small False Start"" sold for over $55.3 million.

As well as setting an auction record for the 92-year-old painter, it is now among the most expensive works by a living artist ever to go under the hammer.
Why Jasper Johns has been 'miscast' as a mysterious artist
""One of the interesting things about the Johns market is that there really has been very little to come to auction by way of significant works,"" Flaum said. ""There certainly have been very significant prices that have traded privately... The auction market particularly has really been starved for top quality work by Johns.""
The diversity of works in Allen's collection extended not only to different time periods but also varied media. Sculptures by Alberto Giacometti and Louise Bourgeois also featured across the two-day sale, alongside a hanging mobile by Alexander Calder, an earthenware ceramic vase by Pablo Picasso and a neon sign by American artist Bruce Nauman.

""It's hard to say there's one unifying principle for a collection that spans 500 years of the greatest works of Western art,"" Carter said. ""But I think, to an extent, you can — he was looking at artists who looked at the world a different way, and who were... looking ahead to the future.""
Allen's sister, Jody Allen, said in a press statement ahead of the sale that, to her brother, art was ""both analytical and emotional.""
""He believed that art expressed a unique view of reality — combining the artist's inner state and inner eye — in a way that can inspire us all,"" she said. ""His collection reflects the diversity of his interests, with their own mystique and beauty.""

Alex Jones ordered to pay nearly half a billion dollars to Sandy Hook families in additional damages

 — 
A Connecticut judge on Thursday ordered right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones to pay an additional $473 million in punitive damages over the lies he told about the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting.
Connecticut Superior Court Judge Barbara Bellis awarded the families over $323 million in common law punitive damages for attorney’s fees and costs and $150 million in damages under a state law called the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act, which prohibits unfair competition and deceptive acts.
“The record also establishes that the defendants repeated the conduct and attacks on the plaintiffs for nearly a decade, including during the trial, wanton, malicious, and heinous conduct that caused harm to the plaintiffs,” Bellis said in her decision. “This depravity, and cruel, persistent course of conduct by the defendants establishes the highest degree of reprehensibility and blameworthiness.”
Alex Jones seeks new trial after Sandy Hook verdict of almost $1 billion
The massive sum of money is in addition to the $965 million a jury awarded eight families of Sandy Hook victims and a first responder last month in compensatory damages. Under Connecticut law, a judge determines the amount of punitive damages to award.
Jones baselessly repeated after the 2012 mass shooting, in which 26 people were killed, that the incident was staged, and that the families and first responders were “crisis actors.”
The lies spawned multiple lawsuits and a trial was held in September and October over lawsuits that were filed in Connecticut.
The plaintiffs in that lawsuit throughout the trial described in poignant terms how the lies had prompted unrelenting harassment against them and compounded the emotional agony of losing their loved ones.
CNN has reached out to Alex Jones’ attorney for comment.
It’s unclear when or how much of the money the plaintiffs will ultimately see.
Jones has said that he will appeal the original Connecticut decision and claimed that there “ain’t no money” to pay the massive figure the jury initially awarded the plaintiffs.
The decision in Connecticut came after a separate jury in Texas determined that Jones and his company should award two Sandy Hook parents who sued in that state nearly $50 million.
While Jones initially lied about the 2012 shooting, he later acknowledged that the massacre had occurred as he faced multiple lawsuits. But he failed to comply with court orders during the discovery process of the lawsuits in Connecticut and Texas, leading the families in each state to win default judgments against him.

Female governors will break a record in 2023
By Simone Pathe, CNN
Published 9:33 PM EST, Wed November 9, 2022

 — 
The US will have a record number of female governors in 2023. Still, the record-setting number – 12 – will represent a small fraction of the top executives across the 50 states.
The previous record of nine female governors serving concurrently was set in 2004, according to the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University.
Incumbent female governors in Maine, Alabama, Michigan, Iowa, South Dakota, Kansas and New Mexico won reelection on Tuesday, while New York Gov. Kathy Hochul won a first full term after taking over the top job in 2021 following the resignation of Andrew Cuomo. Hochul will become the first elected female governor in the state.
Meet the history-makers of the 2022 midterm elections
Two states – Massachusetts and Arkansas – elected new female governors. Democrat Maura Healey will become the first woman elected to the governorship of Massachusetts and the first out lesbian governor in the US. Republican Sarah Huckabee Sanders, a former White House press secretary in the Trump administration, will become the state’s first female governor, winning the job that her father once held.
Arkansas and Massachusetts will also become the first states to have women serving in the governor and lieutenant governor positions at the same time, according to CAWP.
CNN has yet to make a projection in two gubernatorial races – Arizona and Oregon – in which all the candidates are women. Those states are included in the record-setting 12.
Democrat Katie Hobbs, the Arizona secretary of state, was narrowly leading Republican Kari Lake, a favorite of former President Donald Trump, in the Grand Canyon State, as of Wednesday evening.
And in Oregon, Democrat Tina Kotek, a former state House speaker, was marginally ahead of Republican Christine Drazan, a former state House minority leader, while former state Sen. Betsy Johnson, an independent, was pulling less than 10% of the vote, as of Wednesday evening. Kotek could also become one of the first out lesbian governors in the country.
Even before Election Day, 2022 had set a record for the number of all-female gubernatorial matchups. Those five states were Arizona, Alabama, Iowa, Michigan and Oregon. Before this year, there had only been four woman-versus-woman gubernatorial matchups in all of history, according to CAWP. In total, 25 women were nominated for governor by the two major parties in 2022, a historical record. Sixteen of them were Democrats and nine were Republicans.
Of the gubernatorial races that CNN has projected so far, Democrats have won six and Republicans have won four.

DC Attorney General sues Washington Commanders, owner Dan Snyder and NFL for deceiving residents
By Jessica Schneider, Eric Levenson, David Close and Jacob Lev, CNN
Updated 3:49 AM EST, Fri November 11, 2022
Washington Commanders owner Dan Snyder is accused of colluding to deceive DC residents about an investigation into the team's workplace culture.
Tim Heitman/USA Today Sports/Reuters
CNN
 — 
DC Attorney General Karl Racine announced a lawsuit against embattled Washington Commanders owner Dan Snyder, the team and the NFL on Thursday, alleging they colluded to deceive DC residents about an NFL investigation into the team’s toxic workplace culture and allegations of sexual assault.
“For years the team and its owner have caused very real and very serious harm and then lied about it to dodge accountability and to continue to rake in profits,” Racine said Thursday. “So far they seem to have gotten away with it, but that stops today.”
The lawsuit alleges those deceptive efforts aimed to keep fans in the dark and increase profits for the team. The lawsuit cites the District of Columbia’s Consumer Protection Procedures Act, which gives the Attorney General broad authority to hold individuals or a company accountable for misleading customers.
The AG’s investigation began last fall and found that Snyder lied to DC residents when he denied knowing anything about allegations of a hostile work environment and culture of sexual harassment within the team, according to Racine.
“In fact, the evidence shows Snyder was not only aware of the toxic culture within his organization, he encouraged it and he participated in it,” Racine said. “Mr. Snyder exerted a high level of personal control over everything the Commanders did and his misconduct gave others permission to treat women in the same demeaning manner.”
DC Attorney General Karl Racine announced the lawsuit in a press conference Thursday.
WJLA
The NFL and Commanders launched what they billed as an independent investigation into the allegations, but they secretly entered into an agreement to give Snyder power over what could be shared with the public, the lawsuit alleges. At the same time, Snyder and the team tried to interfere with and obstruct the investigation, the lawsuit states.
Ultimately, the NFL released a short press release summarizing the investigation’s findings but said that they did not receive a written investigative report due to confidentiality concerns, the lawsuit states.
“Does any part of this investigation sound independent? Does any of this sound like accountability?” Racine said. “Of course not. That’s why we’re suing.”
Racine is now seeking unspecified financial penalties for every incident in which the parties lied to residents dating back to July 2020. The Attorney General said the penalties could run into the millions of dollars. The lawsuit also seeks a court order forcing the NFL to release all findings from its 10-month investigation into the Commanders’ workplace culture.
Commanders counsel John Brownlee and Stuart Nash issued a joint statement in response to the lawsuit.
Washington Commanders owner Dan Snyder exploring the sale of team
“Over two years ago, Dan and Tanya Snyder acknowledged that an unacceptable workplace culture had existed within their organization for several years and they have apologized many times for allowing that to happen,” they said. “We agree with AG Racine on one thing: the public needs to know the truth. Although the lawsuit repeats a lot of innuendo, half-truths and lies, we welcome this opportunity to defend the organization – for the first time – in a court of law and to establish, once and for all, what is fact and what is fiction.”
NFL vice president of communications Brian McCarthy rejected the allegations as baseless.
“The independent investigation into workplace misconduct at the Washington Commanders was thoroughly and comprehensively conducted by Beth Wilkinson and her law firm. Following the completion of the investigation, the NFL made public a summary of Ms. Wilkinson’s findings and imposed a record-setting fine against the club and its ownership,” he said.
“We reject the legally unsound and factually baseless allegations made today by the DC Attorney General against the NFL and Commissioner Goodell and will vigorously defend against those claims.”
The announcement is just the latest issue for the Commanders, the newly branded team mired in several major investigations. Once one of the NFL’s premiere franchises, the team has had minimal success on the field and consistent controversies off the field over the last two decades under Snyder.
Snyder announced last week that he is considering a sale of the team and that he and his wife hired Bank of America Securities “to consider potential transactions.”
How the investigation began
The allegations stem from a Washington Post report in 2020 in which 15 female former Commanders employees and two journalists who covered the team accused team staffers of sexual harassment and verbal abuse.
After an investigation by attorney Beth Wilkinson, the NFL fined the team $10 million, and Snyder handed control over the franchise’s daily operations to his wife, Tanya Snyder.
Yet the NFL declined to publicly release the findings of the investigation, sparking Congress to get involved with a House Oversight Committee review. Commissioner Goodell testified before the panel in June that the Commanders’ culture was “not only unprofessional, but toxic for far too long.”
Goodell said that the team had not received a written report from Wilkinson in order to preserve the confidentiality of those who had participated in the internal investigation.
Lisa Banks and Debra Katz, who represent over 40 former Commanders employees, released a statement praising the suit and calling on the NFL to release the Wilkinson investigation.
House panel alleges Commanders owner Dan Snyder fostered 'toxic workplace' and 'conducted a shadow investigation' targeting accusers
“Today’s civil complaint filed by the DC Attorney General against the Washington Commanders, Dan Snyder, the NFL, and Commissioner Roger Goodell is further evidence of what we’ve long known: that both the Commanders and the NFL have engaged in deception and lies designed to conceal the team’s decades of sexual harassment and abuse, which has impacted not only the victims of that abuse, but also consumers in the District of Columbia.
“The filing of this complaint also marks an important step in validating the experiences of the brave women and men who came forward and in achieving, for the first time, a level of transparency into the scope of the misconduct.
“For far too long, the NFL has actively concealed wrongdoing by the Washington Commanders and has shielded Mr. Snyder from accountability at every turn. The NFL must understand that sexual harassment and abuse cannot be tolerated or concealed.”
The off-field issues have also been felt by the players and the team, now sitting at a disappointing 4-5 record, good for last place in the NFC East.
“Since I arrived here, it’s been a dark cloud over our organization,” Commanders cornerback Benjamin St-Juste told Journal de Québec on Saturday. “Every time something good happens on the field, something bad happens off the field. A fresh start would give us a renewed energy and would win back the fans’ trust.”
Franchise uses running back’s shooting to make political point
The Commanders also faced sharp criticism for an inflammatory statement posted Wednesday that used the August shooting of running back Brian Robinson Jr. to push back against the lawsuit.
Racine’s office announced Wednesday he would hold a press conference to make a “major announcement” related to the Commanders the next day. In response, the Commanders issued a statement that referenced Robinson’s shooting and criticized its hometown city for “out-of-control violent crime.”
“Less than three months ago, a 23-year-old player on our team was shot multiple times, in broad daylight,” a Commanders spokesperson said in the statement. “Despite the out-of-control violent crime in DC, today the Washington Commanders learned for the first time on Twitter that the DC Attorney General will be holding a press conference to ‘make a major announcement’ related to the organization tomorrow.
Two teens arrested in the shooting of Washington Commanders player Brian Robinson, police say
“It is unfortunate that, in his final days in office, Mr. Racine appears more interested in making splashy headlines, based on offbeat legal theories, rather than doing the hard work of making the streets safe for our citizens, including bringing to justice the people who shot one of our players.”
Robinson, a rookie running back, was shot twice in an attempted armed robbery in August. He missed the first month of the season due to the injuries but has since recovered and returned to the field. Two teens were arrested last week in connection with the shooting.
Robinson’s agent Ryan Williams tweeted his displeasure with the Commanders’ statement on Wednesday night.
“Up until an hour ago, the Commanders handled the Brian Robinson situation with so much care, sincerity and class. And I was so grateful for all of it,” Williams said in a tweet Wednesday. “Although I know that there are some great humans in that building, whoever is hiding behind this statement is not one of them.”
Commanders president Jason Wright issued another statement later on Wednesday, saying the earlier statement “expressed our external counsel’s ongoing frustration with the Attorney General’s office.”
“The lawyers’ legitimate frustrations with the AG should have been separate and apart from referencing the terrible crime that affected our player,” Wright said.

 — 
Between warnings of a recession, high inflation and layoff fears, the news is bleak. Why not have some chocolate?
Chocolate makers are reporting booming sales as stressed out customers reach for something sweet to take the edge off.
In the third quarter, sales of Hershey’s (HSY) chocolates, which include Reese’s, Kit Kat and Hershey bars, jumped 12.6% in retail. Mondelez (MDLZ), the global snack brand that makes Toblerone, Cadbury and others, said its chocolate sales grew 9.3% in the quarter.
Chocolate, like many comfort foods, got a boost during the pandemic. But unlike other categories such as pizza, where interest fell off as employees returned to the office and kids went back to school, chocolate is still growing — thanks in part to demand from stressed out consumers.
“Chocolate grew in 2020 and has maintained that growth, something many industries were not able to do,” according to a 2022 report from the research firm Mintel. “Increased at-home occasions, the need for fun and relief from stress, and the availability and convenience of chocolate all contributed to this upward trajectory.”
In the year through October 30, chocolate sales hit $17.7 billion in US retail, according to data from market research firm IRI, up from $14.6 billion for the year in 2019.

One reason for the growth is higher prices for groceries and snacks, including chocolate. The increase isn’t affecting sales too much — shoppers are not that sensitive to changes in the price of chocolate, said Dan Sadler, principal of client insights at IRI, who has expertise in the confections market and tracks price sensitivity.
In the second quarter, IRI found that elasticity for chocolate was about -.4. That means that a 10% increase in prices would result in only a 4% drop in sales by volume, Sadler explained.
“You can raise that price, and you’ll see a little bit of a hit to volume, but not a whole lot, not like you will in some other categories,” he said.
How America turned into a nation of snackers
Even chocolate makers have been surprised by how well demand is holding up.
Elasticity “remains below expectations,” said Mondelez CEO Dirk Van de Put during a recent analyst call discussing the company’s third-quarter results, lower even than before Covid. “We see consumers saying that chocolate is really something they cannot live without.”
Hershey raised its net sales and earnings outlook for the year on November 4th, when it reported third-quarter results that exceeded its expectations.
“Our products remain an affordable treat for families and for consumers,” said Hershey CEO Michele Buck during an analyst call. “We know that part of that is they want to reward themselves when times are tough. They also use these products to relieve stress. And we think that those trends will continue.”
Customers are making some changes, she noted, like shopping at value channels or choosing value packs.
It’s not s’mores without Hershey
Companies like Mondelez and Hershey are largely spared competition from store brands, or private label, which are gaining ground as grocery prices rise.
According to IRI, just 2.7% of the US chocolate retail market is made up of private label, while that portion is much higher in other categories. In dairy milk, for example, store brands account for about 62% of sales. Even in salty snacks and non-chocolate candy, private label share is at 4.8%.
Shoppers are “brand specific” when it comes to chocolate, Sadler said. “You’re gonna make s’mores with a Hershey bar, you’re not going to substitute with something else.”
Mondelez benefits from that kind of brand loyalty, as well. “Shoppers continue to say they are much less likely to switch to private label in chocolate and biscuits compared to other categories,” said Mondelez’s Van de Put during the call.
Eventually, higher prices may hit the chocolate category. IRI is seeing volume sales start to dip, Sadler noted, suggesting that consumers are becoming more price sensitive.
And though private label sales pale in comparison to national brands, they are also growing at a faster clip than branded chocolate.
IRI’s data shows that private label sales rose 16% in the year through October 30 compared to the year before, while national brands grew by 8.8%.
Still, chocolate isn’t going anywhere. The sweet’s “position as an accessible indulgence will help shield it from significant impacts,” Mintel’s report said.

What to know as states keep counting with key races hanging in the balance
By Jeremy Herb, CNN
Updated 5:58 PM EST, Thu November 10, 2022
An election worker boxes tabulated ballots inside the Maricopa County Recorders Office, Wednesday, Nov. 9, 2022, in Phoenix.
Matt York/AP
CNN
 — 
Key races to determine control of the Senate in Arizona and Nevada have yet to be called as both states race to count hundreds of thousands of ballots that have yet to be processed.
It still may be hours – or days – before enough ballots are counted in those states to determine who won the Senate and gubernatorial races in both states. There are also still many key congressional races uncalled in California and Colorado that will determine what the House looks like when the new Congress is seated in January.
The unofficial results – and lingering uncertainty about who will control Congress next year – hasn’t prevented Republican apprehension about the election results, where an expected Republican wave never materialized. The lackluster GOP results have raised new questions about House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy’s path to the speakership and added a new layer to the looming 2024 feud between former President Donald Trump and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis.
Here’s what you should know as the counting continues:
What is taking so long to count ballots in key states?
The biggest reason for the delay is the way that each state handles the ballots outside of those cast at polling places on Election Day, including both early votes and mail-in ballots.
In Arizona, for instance, CNN’s decision desk estimates there are roughly 675,000 ballots to be counted. The majority of those, about 400,000 ballots, are in Maricopa County, the state’s most populous county that includes Phoenix.
The latest on the 2022 midterm elections
Of those ballots, about 290,000 were dropped off at vote centers on Election Day, Bill Gates, the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors chairman, said on CNN Thursday. Those ballots have to be processed before they can be counted, leading to a lag time in tabulating.
“We’re now getting into what we call late-earlys, so these are early ballots that we would have received over the weekend, or, in specifically 290,000 that were dropped off on election day at our vote centers,” Gates said.
The total was “a record,” he added.
In addition, Maricopa County has about 17,000 ballots that were attempted to be counted on Election Day but were not read by the tabulator because of a printer error, and those ballots still need to be counted, too.
The county has not yet started counting the 290,000 ballots dropped off on Election Day, Gates said Thursday. Officials in Maricopa County said that they expect to release additional vote counts later Thursday evening that would include ballots received Saturday night, Sunday and most of Monday.
In Pima County, Arizona’s second-most populous, officials said there were roughly 159,000 ballots left to be counted as of Wednesday evening, and the county doesn’t expect to complete the count until November 14 or 15.
The uncounted ballots include more than 54,000 early ballots still being processed by the recorder’s office. The county expects to tabulate about 20,000 ballots per day and will post results at 6 p.m. local time each day.
Nevada mail-in ballots still arriving
In Nevada, the state law allows mail-in ballots to be received through Saturday, as long as they were postmarked by Election Day, meaning counties are still receiving ballots to be counted.
Clark County, the state’s largest that includes Las Vegas, received more than 12,000 postmarked ballots from the post office on Wednesday, Clark County registrar Joe Gloria said. The number dropped significantly on Thursday, however, as the county received another 626 ballots from the Postal Service.
How election officials staved off chaos at polling places Tuesday
In addition, counties in Nevada have tens of thousands of mail-in ballots that were dropped off on Election Day in drop boxes located at polling places. Clark County said that its Election Day drop boxes contained nearly 57,000 mail ballots.
In all, there are more than 50,000 ballots that need to be counted in Clark County, which are in “various stages in the process of validation,” Gloria said in a Thursday update.
Washoe County, which includes Reno, received close to 18,500 ballots on Tuesday from voting centers and the post office, as well as about 4,000 additional ballots in the mail Wednesday, according to Jamie Rodriguez, the county’s interim registrar of voters.
Bethany Drysdale, a spokeswoman for the county, told CNN Thursday there still were about 20,000 ballots that needed to be counted. “More mail in ballots will arrive today, but we can’t estimate how many,” she said.
Rodriguez told reporters at a Wednesday press conference that the county was still adjusting to the use of mail-in ballots and got more than they did during the primary earlier this year.
“Not that we weren’t expecting a large number of ballots coming in – seeing two full shelves of ballots, though, is a little more than we expected, and I think a little harder for us now than in the primary,” Rodriguez said.
Trump vs. DeSantis
The lackluster performance of several Trump-endorsed candidates in battleground states has cast new doubts about Trump’s potential 2024 campaign launch that’s expected at an event scheduled for Tuesday.
Trump grapples with 2024 questions amid GOP midterm letdown
At the same time, DeSantis’s resounding reelection victory in Florida is fueling calls for him to capitalize on his momentum and challenge Trump for the 2024 nomination.
The beginning of the presidential jockeying right after the midterms end is nothing new, but the potential fight in the Republican Party looking for 2024 is particularly noteworthy after Trump teed up the night before the election that he would be making an announcement at a Florida rally the next Tuesday.
The Trump-DeSantis showdown has been simmering for months now, but it could burst into the open as the 2024 primary season officially gets underway. A Trump adviser told CNN Wednesday that DeSantis “was already having a moment but the spotlight just quadrupled in intensity” after Tuesday’s election.
After ‘red wave’ washes out, McCarthy faces tougher path
McCarthy is moving swiftly to lock down votes needed to claim the speaker’s gavel in the next Congress, as Republicans are still closing in on a majority in the House even after Democrats had a better-than-expected night on Tuesday. CNN has not yet projected a Republican takeover of the chamber.
But the ultimate size of a Republican majority could determine how difficult it will be for McCarthy to become speaker, as a narrow majority could prompt the pro-Trump House Freedom Caucus to stand in the way of McCarthy’s leadership ambitions.
A source familiar with the House Freedom Caucus’ deliberations told CNN on Wednesday morning there are around two dozen current and incoming members willing to vote against McCarthy if he doesn’t offer them concessions. They are actively discussing putting up a nominal challenger to face McCarthy in next week’s leadership elections in an effort to force the GOP leader to give them more influence in how the House operates, the source said.
Rep. Bob Good of Virginia, a member of the hardline House Freedom Caucus, told reporters Thursday that McCarthy “has not done anything to earn my vote” for speaker, predicting there would be a challenge to McCarthy for the role.
This story has been updated with additional developments Thursday.
CNN’s Ellie Kaufmann, Bob Ortega, Gary Tuchman, Paul Vercammen, Kristen Holmes, Gabby Orr, Manu Raju, Melanie Zanona, Christina Maxouris, Anna Maja Rappard and Kyung Lah contributed to this report.

 — 
Russia’s Defense Ministry says its troops are preparing to withdraw from a large part of the occupied Ukrainian region of Kherson, in a move that’s humiliating but also – after the developments of recent weeks – unsurprising.
The plan would give up thousands of square kilometers (including some of Ukraine’s best farmland) that Russia has occupied since the early days of the invasion, and was formally declared its territory just five weeks ago.
At a choreographed meeting in Moscow on Wednesday, Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and General Sergey Surovikin – the recently appointed commander of what Moscow refers to as its “Special Military Operation” in Ukraine – put the best possible face on the withdrawal.
Since August, Russian troops have killed 9,500 Ukrainian soldiers in Kherson and successfully repelled “up to 80% to 90% of enemy missiles,” Surovikin claimed.
Nevertheless, a retreat would protect the lives of civilians and troops, he said.
“I understand that this is a very difficult decision, but at the same time we will preserve the most important thing – the lives of our servicemen and the overall combat capability of the grouping of troops, which is futile to keep on the right (west) bank in a limited area,” Surovikin said.
Russia will withdraw forces from Kherson in Ukraine war setback
Russian commentators and officials have carefully avoided the word retreat, spinning the “withdrawal” as a smart military call to regroup on the eastern side of the river Dnipro, in defensible positions that Ukrainian forces would struggle to destroy.
It’s not known at this stage how the Ukrainians will respond. Their troops on the southern front lines are exhausted and the land ahead of them is likely to be heavily mined. Pursuing the Russian troops would shed more blood, as would any fighting in dense areas like Kherson city.
Ukraine will “move very carefully, without emotions, without unnecessary risk,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said late on Wednesday in his daily video message.
“We are gradually moving to the south, strengthening our positions. Step by step,” he said.
The announcement in Moscow did not provoke the chest-thumping that accompanied previous reversals.
Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov, who has often been critical of the Defense Ministry and the high command, said Surovikin had saved a thousand soldiers and “made a difficult but right choice between senseless sacrifices for the sake of loud statements and saving the priceless lives of soldiers.”
Kadyrov added that Kherson was a difficult place to fight, especially without guaranteed resupply routes.
In the summer, when Ukraine received longer-range rockets such as the US HIMARS, it set about degrading as many river bridges, railroad hubs and supply depots deep behind Russian lines as it could reach. The Russians resorted to pontoon bridges – even submerging railway cars – but getting munitions and other supplies across the Dnipro became increasingly difficult.
But not everyone accepted the Kherson withdrawal with equanimity. Hawkish Russian commentator Sergey Markov described the planned relinquishment of Kherson on his Telegram channel as “the largest geopolitical defeat of Russia since the collapse of the USSR. The political consequences of this huge defeat will be really big.”
“The main reason for this defeat is the rejection of a real war and the catastrophic delay in making the necessary decisions,” he continued.
Kadyrov seemed to agree that delays had whittled down Moscow’s options. Fighting in Kherson required “a stable regular supply of ammunition and the formation of a strong, reliable rear,” he said. “Why was this not done from the first days of the special operation?”
Back in October, when Surovikin got the job as overall commander of the operation, he warned that difficult choices must be faced. The Kharkiv debacle – which saw Ukrainian forces sweep across much of the region in one week – predated his appointment, and he may have been wary that Kherson could quickly become another embarrassment.
On October 18, in an interview with Russian state news agency TASS, Surovikin said that plans for Kherson would depend on the “evolving military-tactical situation,” which he described as “already very difficult.”
“We will act consciously, in a timely manner, not excluding the adoption of difficult decisions,” he said.
Discretion, it seems, became the better part of valor. Over the past two weeks, Russian forces have dug in on the east bank. Pillbox guardhouses have become a common sight; trenches appeared on satellite imagery and civilians were unceremoniously removed from homes close to the river.
What happens if Russia withdraws
If and when Russian troops do withdraw to the east bank, their supply lines will become easier and they will regain defense in depth. Any attempt by Ukrainian forces to cross the Dnipro would be costly to the point of prohibitive.
Russia would retain control of 60 per cent of the Kherson region, including the coastline along the Sea of Azov. So long as Moscow’s troops control and fortify the Dnipro’s east bank, Ukrainian forces will struggle to damage or disrupt the canal that carries fresh water to Crimea.
Surovikin’s priority appears to be stabilizing Russia’s defensive lines after a difficult few months. He made the point on Wednesday that the forces being pulled out of Kherson “will be used for active operations, including offensive ones, in other directions in the operation zone.”
There is always a chance that the Moscow meeting on Wednesday was designed to lure Ukrainian forces into a trap, and that the Russians don’t intend to abandon the west bank altogether. Senior Ukrainian officials have certainly been skeptical. But the tactical situation for Russian forces, pushed into a shrinking pocket above the river, has gone from challenging to near-impossible in weeks.
Russian troops slam generals over 'incomprehensible battle' that reportedly killed 300 in Donetsk
The larger political failure in Kherson can’t be camouflaged. Russian-appointed officials have run Kherson city and environs since March. They have distributed Russian passports to anyone who would have one, talked about the ruble replacing the Ukrainian hryvnia, and organized the wholesale theft of grain.
Senior officials arrived from Moscow to discuss Kherson’s integration into the “Russian world.” And then there was the illegal and implausible referendum in September, followed by the pomp of the ceremony in Moscow annexing Kherson and three other regions.
On September 30, Putin said he had a message for Kyiv. “People living in Luhansk and Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia are becoming our citizens. Forever.”
“We will defend our land with all the powers and means at our disposal.”
There again, a week is a long time in politics. The celebrations orchestrated by Putin little over a month ago have been confounded in one region, just as Ukrainian forces begin to make inroads in Luhansk as well.

 — 
The Artemis I mission, which is expected to send an uncrewed spacecraft on a test mission around the moon, is delayed yet again, as NASA’s Space Launch System faces Tropical Storm Nicole, which is now expected to strengthen into a hurricane before it slams into Florida’s East Coast.
The space agency had been targeting November 14 for the third launch attempt but is now looking at November 16, “pending safe conditions for employees to return to work, as well as inspections after the storm has passed,” NASA said in a statement Tuesday evening. November 16 would offer a two-hour launch window that opens at 1:04 a.m. ET.
The rocket, often referred to as SLS, is sitting on its launchpad at Kennedy Space Center, which lies just to the north of where the storm’s center is expected to make landfall, CNN meteorologist Brandon Miller noted. That will mean the area can expect some of the strongest winds the system will bring.
If it is a 75-mile-per-hour (120-kph) Category 1 hurricane, as it’s predicted to be, gusts could range between 80 and 90 miles per hour (130 to 145 kph), according to Miller. That could mean the rocket will get battered by winds higher than the predetermined limits of what the rocket can withstand. Officials have said that SLS is designed to withstand gusts of up to 85 miles per hour (137 kph).
“Further, the National Weather Service in Melbourne, Florida, has forecasted max wind gusts occurring early Thursday morning of 86 miles per hour,” Miller added. “So yes, this is absolutely possible that wind gusts exceed that threshold.”
The National Hurricane Center’s latest report also gives a 15% chance that Cocoa Beach, which lies about 20 miles (32 kilometers) south of the launch site, will endure sustained hurricane-force winds.
Officials at NASA, however, said in a statement “forecasts predict the greatest risks at the pad are high winds that are not expected to exceed the SLS design.”
“The rocket is designed to withstand heavy rains at the launch pad and the spacecraft hatches have been secured to prevent water intrusion,” the statement continues.

The space agency decided to roll the SLS rocket out to its launchpad last week, as the storm was still an unnamed system brewing off the East Coast. At the time, officials had been expecting this storm to bring in sustained winds of around 25 knots (29 miles per hour) with gusts of up to 40 knots (46 miles per hour), which was deemed to be well within the predetermined limits of what the rocket can withstand, according to comments from Mark Burger, a launch weather officer with the US Space Force’s 45th Weather Squadron, at a NASA news conference on November 3.
“The National Hurricane Center just has a 30% chance of it becoming a named storm,” Burger said last Thursday. “However, that being said, the models are very consistent on developing some sort of a low pressure.”

But the storm did grow into a named system on Monday, three days after the rocket was rolled out to the launchpad.
The storm’s strength is unusual, as Nicole is expected to be the first hurricane to strike the United States in November in nearly 40 years.
To prepare for the storm, NASA said its teams have powered down the Orion spacecraft, which sits atop the SLS rocket, as well as the rocket’s side boosters and other components.
“Engineers have also installed a hard cover over the launch abort system window, retracted and secured the crew access arm on the mobile launcher and configured the settings for the environmental control system on the spacecraft and rocket elements,” according to the statement. “Teams also are securing nearby hardware and performing walkdowns for potential debris in the area.”
Kennedy Space Center announced on its Twitter feed Tuesday that it is “in a HURICON III status and continues to prep for the upcoming storm taking prudent precautions across all of our programs, activities, and workforce in advance of the storm.”
The HURICON III preparations include “securing facilities, property and equipment” as well as deploying a rideout team, which is a staff that will be on site to assess any damages.
NASA sets date for another try at Artemis I launch
The SLS rocket had been stowed away for weeks after issues with fuel leaks thwarted the first two launch attempts and then Hurricane Ian rolled through Florida, forcing the rocket to vacate the launchpad in September.
Officials at NASA returned the rocket to the launchpad last week with the goal of working toward a third launch attempt on November 14. It’s not clear how or if the storm could impact those plans.
The overall goal of NASA’s Artemis program is to return humans to the moon for the first time in half a century. And the Artemis I mission — expected to be the first of many — will lay the groundwork, testing the rocket and spacecraft and all their subsystems to ensure they are safe enough for astronauts to fly to the moon and back.

Ukraine claims big gains in south, but fears retreating Russians will turn Kherson into ‘city of death’

Big blow to Putin as Russia orders to withdraw from Kherson
02:30 - Source: CNN
Kyiv, Ukraine
CNN
 — 
Ukraine’s military said it had retaken swathes of territory in Kherson on Thursday after Moscow ordered a partial withdrawal from the area, though officials in Kyiv warned that retreating Russian soldiers could turn the regional capital into a “city of death” on their way out.
A military spokesman said that in just 24 hours, Ukrainian forces had pushed the front line in the key southern region of Kherson forward by 7 kilometers (4.3 miles) and taken control of more than 260 square kilometers of territory (100 square miles). Kyiv said it took control of the towns of Snihurivka and Kyselivka, both of which sit along key roads leading into Kherson city, the regional capital. Kyselivka is located about 15 kilometers (9 miles) away from Kherson city.
Moscow on Wednesday said its troops would withdraw from the west bank of the Dnipro River, an area that includes Kherson city, in one of the biggest military setbacks for Russia since its invasion began. A spokesman for the Russian Defense Ministry said that effort began the following day.
Officials in Kyiv, however, have treated the announcement with skepticism. Kherson is one of four Ukrainian regions that Russia attempted to annex in violation of international law, and some doubt that Moscow would give up fighting for a territory filled with people that Russian President Vladimir Putin vowed would be Russian citizens “forever.”
Ukrainian officials are also concerned that the Russian military will embrace scorched earth tactics and leave behind a trail of devastation in the wake of their withdrawal. Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, alleged Thursday that Russia “wants to turn Kherson into a ‘city of death.’”
The Russian military “mines everything they can: apartments, sewers. Artillery on the left [eastern] bank plans to turn the city into ruins. This is what ‘Russian world’ looks like: came, robbed, celebrated, killed ‘witnesses,’ left ruins and left,” Podolyak tweeted.
Ukraine military spokesman Vladyslav Nazarov said Russian forces were continuing to shell areas recaptured by the Ukrainian military and attempted to strike humanitarian aid distribution points.
However, signs of the retreat have begun to emerge.
Gen. Mark Milley, the chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Washington had seen the “beginnings” of a Russian withdrawal in Kherson. Satellite imagery taken last week of Russian-occupied Crimea showed trenches being dug near the border with Kherson, a possible sign that Russian military leaders are nervous about the progress of Ukraine’s counteroffensive.
Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky said more than 41 settlements in southern Ukraine have been liberated following Russia’s decision to move to the eastern side of the Dnipro river.
He added that police units had moved into several settlements in Kherson to begin stabilization measures, but the liberation of Ukrainian territory was just the first step in a long process.
Ukraine’s commander-in-chief, Valerii Zaluzhnyi, said Kyiv’s military success in Kherson left Russia with “no other option but to resort to fleeing.” When asked if the withdrawal was actually taking place, Zaluzhnyi said Ukrainian authorities could neither confirm nor deny it. But defending occupied territory on the west bank of Kherson had become increasingly difficult for the Russians as Ukrainian forces disabled bridges across the Dnipro and attacked Russian supply lines.
Russia's withdrawal from half of Kherson is both humiliating and unsurprising
While Russia’s top military leaders attempted to put the best possible face on the withdrawal, it is undoubtedly a major and humiliating setback for the Kremlin.
“I understand that this is a very difficult decision, but at the same time we will preserve the most important thing – the lives of our servicemen and the overall combat capability of the grouping of troops, which is futile to keep on the right (west) bank in a limited area,” said General Sergey Surovikin, the recently appointed commander of the war effort.
If and when Russian troops do withdraw to the east bank, their supply lines will become easier to manage and they will regain defense in depth. Any attempt by Ukrainian forces to cross the Dnipro could be costly to the point of prohibitive.
Russia would still retain control of 60% of the Kherson region, including the coastline along the Sea of Azov. So long as Moscow’s troops control and fortify the Dnipro’s east bank, Ukrainian forces will struggle to damage or disrupt the canal that carries fresh water to Crimea.

On Thursday night, several social media accounts in Kherson spoke of explosions along the river on Thursday night. Local groups reported on Telegram channels that two bridges near Kherson city had been shelled from the east bank, where the Russians have fortified positions.
CNN is unable to verify the reports and no geolocatable images have emerged.
Telegram channels also reported gunfire on the outskirts of the city, and upriver, local social media networks reported explosions in Kakhovka and the sound of motorboats crossing the river.
There were also reports — again unofficial — of explosions on or near bridges at Zahorianivka and Muzykivka and near the Kakhovka hydro-electric power plant, where there is a large dam.
Neither the Ukrainian government nor Russian appointees in Kherson have commented on the explosions.
As Russian forces pulled back in Kherson, Ukrainian authorities in neighboring Mykolaiv were hoping for some respite from the persistent missile attacks that have hit the city over the past few months.
Vitalii Kim, head of Mykolaiv regional administration, said on his Telegram channel: “Lots of good news for today. We are preparing to reconnect electricity, heat, humanitarian aid kits, medicines, etc.”
The last few settlements in the Mykolaiv region occupied by the Russians have now been liberated, but Kim said: “We continue to remain silent, because it is all the military’s business.”

 — 
In 2019, Air Company made a splash when it launched vodka derived from recaptured carbon, in an effort to reduce the amount of the harmful greenhouse gas in the atmosphere.
Today, the Brooklyn-based startup has begun using the same process to make fuel for airplanes.
Air Company’s sustainable aviation fuel, which was recently tested by the US Air Force, could ultimately help the airline industry hit its goal of net zero carbon emissions by 2050. Currently, the airline industry accounts for about 3% of total global carbon emissions each year, and mostly relies on traditional, fossil-based fuels that require various forms of environmental disruption to produce.
Gravity could solve renewable energy's biggest problem
Already, some of the world’s biggest airlines are signing on to Air Company’s vision. The company announced last month that Jet Blue and Virgin Atlantic, as well as startup aircraft company Boom Supersonic, have agreed to purchase millions of gallons of its fuel in the coming years. Jet Blue Ventures, the airline’s investment arm, also invested directly in Air Company’s $30 million Series A funding round earlier this year.
Air Company's carbon-neutral, CO2-derived fuel was successfully used in August 2022 during a test flight in partnership with the US Air Force.
Air Company
“How we think about what the company does is trying to solve humanity’s toughest problems,” Gregory Constantine, co-founder and CEO of Air Company, told CNN in an interview last month. “For us, climate change is the greatest challenge that we’re facing as humanity to date … so if we can work on technologies that take what was once really thought of as a problem and turn it into a solution, then that’s a massive win.”
A number of producers of sustainable aviation fuel have emerged in recent years, including a major Finnish producer called Neste, many of them using ingredients such as plant material and cooking oil. But Air Company’s production process starts by pulling harmful carbon emissions out of the air.
The company first harvests carbon, mostly from industrial settings such as biofuel production facilities. It then takes water, separates the hydrogen from the oxygen, and blends the captured carbon with the hydrogen and a proprietary mix of other compounds, according to Air Company CTO Stafford Sheehan. It then distills that solution down, using what looks like a larger version of, say, a whiskey distilling system. The final products are ethyl alcohol, which is used to make the company’s vodka and other products such as perfume, as well as paraffin, which forms the basis of its jet fuel.
These 'flying' ferries could get you to work in half the time
In some ways, Sheehan said, the process mimics how plants work: It takes in carbon, and aside from the final products, the only other offput is oxygen. And the company says its tests have indicated that planes should be able to fly using its fuel without blending it with fossil-based fuels or modifying their engines.
By the time a plane has flown using Air Company’s fuel, it will have released the same amount of carbon dioxide back into the atmosphere as was captured to make the fuel, meaning the process on the whole is carbon-neutral, Sheehan said. The company uses renewable energy sources like solar to power its production facility.
Air Company does still have some work to do until its carbon-derived fuel is ready to be used widely on commercial flights. It needs more testing, and it needs to grow its manufacturing footprint. Sheehan said the company’s next production facility is already in the works and will be about 100 times the size of its Brooklyn test facility, which is probably about the size of a two-bedroom New York City apartment.
Air Company was founded in 2019 by Gregory Constantine and Dr. Stafford Sheehan.
Air Company
The company will also need to bring down the cost of its fuel, which is currently more expensive than traditional jet fuels, although the company declined to provide details on just how much. Air Company said that “consumers will not feel the impact of this shift,” and added that lowering the cost will be achieved in part “through an array of government incentives made available to fuel producers generating sustainable alternatives.”
Constantine said the company is planning for the first test of its fuel on a commercial plane next year, and expects to have its fuel used on its first commercial passenger flight by 2024.
Still, Air Company is hopeful that its efforts could eventually disrupt the aviation industry for the better, just as it’s been working to do with its consumer goods.
“Aviation has been a part of the goal since the start,” he said. “However, to get to those, you know, large industrial markets like aviation fuel, which it is traditionally known as the hottest industry industries to decarbonize, is going to take time. It’s going to take a lot of money and a lot of effort.”

 — 
Homes and buildings are collapsing into the ocean and authorities have issued warnings to evacuate some areas as Tropical Storm Nicole pushes a huge volume of ocean water onshore in southeast Florida.
Video from Volusia County shows homes crumbling, reduced to wreckage, as Nicole’s waves erode the coastline. Separate video shows the county’s beach safety office collapsing into the rising water.
“Right now, ground zero is here,” Volusia County Sheriff Mike Chitwood told CNN affiliate WESH-TV on Wednesday as Nicole came ashore as a category 1 hurricane.
A Wilbur-by-the-Sea beachside home was left on the edge of a sandy cliff Wednesday after rough surf and storm surge caused by Tropical Storm Nicole washed away about 20 feet of sand.

Three main factors are contributing to the dangerous situation on the coast.
Nicole’s storm surge, which peaked at around 6 feet Thursday morning, is significant because of how massive the storm was as it approached Florida on Wednesday, with tropical-storm-force winds stretching for more than 500 miles.
That storm surge pushed ashore on top of exceptionally high tides associated with this week’s full moon.
And behind it all, sea level in this part of Florida has risen more than a foot in the past 100 years, according to data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and most of that rise has occurred in the past three decades.

Scientists and researchers have long warned that sea level rise is leading to more erosion and high-tide flooding — particularly during extreme coastal storms. This is putting even more stress on sea walls, which are meant to protect coastal communities from high waves and water levels.
“We do gradually put more stress on [sea walls] with sea level rise,” Brian McNoldy, a senior research associate at the University of Miami’s School of Marine and Atmospheric Science, told CNN. “More and more of them are gradually, completely submerged in saltwater, which concrete does not like.”
McNoldy also noted that these walls are aging, and the back-to-back nature of storms is making seawalls more vulnerable. It was only six weeks ago that Hurricane Ian’s storm surge eroded parts of Florida’s eastern coast.
“It doesn’t really take a strong storm – you just need high tides or storm-agitated tides to wash away or put extra stress on the walls,” he said. “Having these two storms six weeks apart, if you don’t give places any time to repair or replenish, each storm definitely leaves its mark.”
Sea level rise is putting more coastal homes at risk to storm surge, high tides and large waves.
WKMG
Many coastal communities in the US experience nuisance flooding, or high-tide flooding, on a regular basis. Higher sea levels, caused by warmer water temperatures and melting glaciers and ice sheets, increase the hazards coastal residents are exposed to.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported in 2019 that by 2050, the United States will experience 25 to 75 days of high-tide flooding.
Additionally, hurricane storm surge is creeping higher, and homes and other critical infrastructure are now exposed to saltwater and erosion that they weren’t a few decades ago.

 — 
Facebook parent company Meta on Wednesday said it is laying off 11,000 employees, marking the most significant job cuts in the tech giant’s history.
The job cuts come as Meta confronts a range of challenges to its core business and makes an uncertain and costly bet on pivoting to the metaverse. It also comes amid a spate of layoffs at other tech firms in recent months as the high-flying sector reacts to high inflation, rising interest rates and fears of a looming recession.
“Today I’m sharing some of the most difficult changes we’ve made in Meta’s history,” CEO Mark Zuckerberg wrote in a blog post to employees. “I’ve decided to reduce the size of our team by about 13% and let more than 11,000 of our talented employees go.”
Facebook became Meta one year ago. Its metaverse dream feels as far away as ever
The job cuts will impact many corners of the company, but Meta’s recruiting team will be hit particularly hard as “we’re planning to hire fewer people next year,” Zuckerberg said in the post. He added that a hiring freeze would be extended until the first quarter, with few exceptions.
In September, Meta had a headcount of more than 87,000, per a September SEC filing.
Meta’s core ad sales business has been hit by privacy changes implemented by Apple, advertisers tightening budgets and heightened competition from newer rivals like TikTok. Meanwhile, Meta has been spending billions to build a future version of the internet, dubbed the metaverse, that likely remains years away from widespread acceptance.
Last month, the company posted its second quarterly revenue decline and said that its profit was cut in half from the prior year. Once valued at more than $1 trillion last year, Meta’s market value has since plunged to around $250 billion.
“I want to take accountability for these decisions and for how we got here,” Zuckerberg wrote in his post Wednesday. “I know this is tough for everyone, and I’m especially sorry to those impacted.”
Shares of Meta rose 5% in trading Wednesday following the announcement.
Meta is not alone in feeling the pain of a market downturn. The tech sector has been facing a dizzying reality check as inflation, rising interest rates and more macroeconomic headwinds have led to a stunning shift in spending for an industry that only grew more dominant as consumers shifted more of their lives online during the pandemic.
“At the start of Covid, the world rapidly moved online and the surge of e-commerce led to outsized revenue growth,” Zuckerberg wrote Wednesday. “Many people predicted this would be a permanent acceleration that would continue even after the pandemic ended. I did too, so I made the decision to significantly increase our investments. Unfortunately, this did not play out the way I expected.”
“I got this wrong, and I take responsibility for that,” he added.
Meta’s headcount in September was nearly twice the 48,268 staffers it had at the start of the pandemic in March of 2020.
A handful of tech companies have announced hiring freezes or job cuts in recent months, often after having seen rapid growth during the pandemic. Last week, rideshare company Lyft said it was axing 13% of employees, and payment-processing firm Stripe said it was cutting 14% of its staff. The same day, e-commerce giant Amazon said it was implementing a pause on corporate hiring.
Also last week, Facebook-rival Twitter announced mass layoffs impacting roles across the company as its new owner, Elon Musk, took the helm.
In addition to the layoffs, Zuckerberg said the company expects to “roll out more cost-cutting changes” in the coming months. Meta, which like other tech giants is known for its vast, perk-filled offices, is rethinking its real estate needs, he said, and “transitioning to desk sharing for people who already spend most of their time outside the office.”
“Overall,” he said, “this will add up to a meaningful cultural shift in how we operate.”

US observed Russian navy preparing for possible test of nuclear-powered torpedo

Russian navy seen preparing for possible test of nuclear-powered torpedo

CNN
 — 
The US observed Russian naval vessels preparing for a possible test of a new nuclear-powered torpedo in recent weeks, a senior US official with direct knowledge told CNN.
Among the vessels which took part in the preparations was the Belgorod, a cruise missile submarine modified for special operations that is able to launch unmanned underwater vehicles including the Poseidon torpedo.
In the last week, the vessels were observed leaving the testing area in the Arctic Sea and heading back to port without carrying out a test. The US believes the Russians may have encountered technical difficulties.
“This can be seen as part of the bigger picture and Russia’s recent military practice, sending ill-trained and under-equipped troops to Ukraine,” a Western diplomat told CNN. “Russia’s military industry is going through difficult times, and we can also see that Western sanctions on high-tech military goods are having an effect and must continue.”
Russia will withdraw forces from Kherson in Ukraine war setback
US officials said Russia could attempt to test the torpedo again but note the waters in the testing area will soon begin to ice over, limiting the window for operations.
A test of the torpedo would likely have inflamed tensions with the US even further at a time when Washington and its allies have been carefully monitoring for any sign Russia might be preparing to use nuclear weapons in the war in Ukraine. The US has also been paying particular attention to any possible tests of the Poseidon torpedo.
The Poseidon torpedo is a nuclear-powered unmanned underwater vehicle capable of carrying both conventional and nuclear munitions. Its nuclear propulsion system gives the Poseidon virtually limitless range.
The US does not believe any test would have involved detonating a nuclear device. Any potential danger would come from a malfunction of the nuclear propulsion system, which could pose risks from radioactivity.
President Vladimir Putin first announced the existence of the Poseidon system during his State of the Nation address in 2018, touting it as an “innovative” new weapon.
US officials urge Ukraine to signal it is still open to diplomatic discussions with Russia
“The nuclear power unit is unique for its small size while offering an amazing power-weight ratio. It is a hundred times smaller than the units that power modern submarines but is still more powerful and can switch into combat mode, that is to say, reach maximum capacity, 200 times faster,” Putin said at the time.
The Belgorod is the longest submarine in the ocean today and was turned over to the Russian Navy in June.
At more than 608 feet, it is longer even than the US Navy’s Ohio class ballistic and guided missile submarines, which come in at 569 feet.
The Belgorod was floated in 2019 and was expected to be delivered to the Russian Navy in 2020 after trials and testing, but those were delayed by the coronavirus pandemic, Russia’s state-run TASS news agency reported. No timeline for the sub’s first deployment was given.
US officials divided over new intelligence suggesting Russian military discussed scenarios for using nuclear weapons
TASS previously reported that the sub will carry the in-development Poseidon nuclear-capable torpedoes, which are being designed to be launched from hundreds of miles away and to sneak past coastal defenses by traveling along the sea floor.
In November 2020, Christopher Ford, then assistant secretary of state for international security and non-proliferation, said Poseidons are being designed to “inundate US coastal cities with radioactive tsunamis.”
A US Congressional Research Service (CRS) report in April said Poseidons are intended as retaliatory weapons, designed to hit back at an enemy after a nuclear strike on Russia.
According to the CRS report, the Belgorod would be capable of carrying up to eight Poseidons, though some weapons experts say its payload is more likely to be six torpedoes.
CNN’s Brad Lendon contributed reporting.

Fred Hickman, a pioneering sports broadcaster and anchor who helped to launch two major cable networks and influenced and informed a generation of sports journalists and fans, has died.
Hickman, who turned 66 on October 16, died peacefully in hospital after battling liver cancer according to his widow Sheila.
“A light has gone out,” Sheila Hickman told CNN.
Hickman was one of the first anchors on CNN. On June 1, 1980, the network’s first day on the air, he and Nick Charles were the first hosts of “Sports Tonight,” the 11 pm ET sports news and highlights program which competed with ESPN’s “SportsCenter,” often winning the time slot.
He stayed with CNN and Turner Sports for most of the next 21 years,
“Fred truly succeeded at everything he did and was adored by his colleagues in front of the camera and behind the scenes,” said Cory Charles, Nick Charles’ widow. Charles passed away in 2011.
“Fred and my late husband were known as Nick & Hick. I have so many memories over the past 30 years of him, not only as Nick’s partner, but as a dear friend and brother,” she said. “The two of them were not only incredible on the air but so hysterical off camera together.”
In 2001, Hickman moved to the YES Network, the regional sports network that airs Yankees and Brooklyn Nets games, among other programming. He was the first anchor to appear on the network’s initial broadcast on March 19, 2002, and its lead anchor for the network’s first three years.
“Fred was a joy to work with and a joyful person,” said YES broadcaster Michael Kay in a statement included in the network’s tribute to him Wednesday. “A total pro that you felt comfortable knowing would lead you the right way on the air. He was the first voice ever heard on YES and his professionalism put us all on the right track.”
After his time at YES, he moved to ESPN in 2004, serving as a host of “SportsCenter” among other programing there through 2008. He then moved on to Fox, serving as pre- and post-game host for the Atlanta Braves broadcasts on the Fox Sports South and Sport South Networks, through 2011.

Recently, he served as an anchor and managing editor at Black News Channel.
He was praised by many of his former colleagues and fans when news of his passing spread on Wednesday.
“I was the only female anchor at CNN Sports, and Fred was such a welcoming presence…always with a laugh, a quip, a story…and supremely talented,” ESPN’s Hannah Storm tweeted Wednesday.
“Had the privilege of working with him & Nick at CNN Sports. Huge talent with huge heart,” tweeted Dan Hicks of NBC Sports.
“If you are about my age, he was one of the faces on your sports-crazy youth on CNN. He was a true OG in the field,” tweeted Pittsburgh sports radio host Colin Dunlap, who called Hickman and some of his colleagues from that time “our internet before the internet.”
“It didn’t matter if you were a high-level executive or a production assistant on your first day, Fred made you feel special as soon as he met you. He was a wonderful person to be around – someone who brightened every room he walked into,” said YES anchor Bob Lorenz in YES’ tribute to him.
“As a professional Fred was noteworthy for his studio acumen, his presence that gave a fledgling nework instant credibility, his dedication to his craft and his excellence under pressure,” said John Filippelli, president of production and programming at YES.
Hickman began his broadcast career in radio, first in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, while he was in college, then at a station in his hometown of Springfield, Illinois.
He soon became an anchor, director and reporter at WICS-TV, also in Springfield. He worked there two years soon after college before moving to CNN.

President Joe Biden said Twitter owner and Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s relationship with other countries was “worthy of being looked at,” but declined to say how that could be done.
“I think that Elon Musk’s cooperation and/or technical relationships with other countries is worthy of being looked at, whether or not he is doing anything inappropriate,” Biden said, when asked if Musk was a threat to national security. “But that’s all I’ll say.”
When a reporter in the room asked, “How?” the President responded: “There’s a lot of ways.”
Twitter stock falls after report says Biden admin weighing security review of Musk ventures
Just before Musk completed his $44-billion acquisition, Bloomberg reported that Biden administration officials were in early discussions about possibly subjecting some of Musk’s ventures to national security reviews, including the Twitter takeover. Asked by CNN at the time, the administration pushed back on the report, which cited people familiar with the matter.
“We do not know of any such conversations,” National Security Council Spokesperson Adrienne Watson said in a statement. A Treasury spokesperson said the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States “does not publicly comment on transactions that it may or may not be reviewing” by law and practice.
Among the equity investors who committed to provide financing to help Musk fund the deal are several foreign entities, including the Qatar sovereign wealth fund and Saudi Arabian Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, who was already one of Twitter’s largest investors prior to Musk’s proposed takeover.
– CNN’s Clare Duffy contributed to this report.

Donald Trump believes we should terminate “all rules, regulations and articles, even those found in the Constitution” to overturn the 2020 election. That was his view on 1/6 and remains his view today. No honest person can now deny that Trump is an enemy of the Constitution.

Justice Sonia Sotomayor declines to block NYC public sector Covid-19 vaccine mandate
By Ariane de Vogue and Tierney Sneed, CNN

 — 
Justice Sonia Sotomayor on Thursday rejected a request that the Supreme Court block New York City’s public sector Covid-19 vaccine requirement as it applies to employees with who have religious objections to the vaccine.
The emergency application from the New Yorkers for Religious Liberty was filed with Sotomayor, who supervises the lower courts that have ruled in the case.
Her order rejecting it did not indicate that she had put the matter before the full court.
Supreme Court justices finally get together behind closed doors with a long to-do list
The challengers argued that they have been forced to choose between the mandate and their public sector jobs. Plaintiffs include firefighters, teachers, and police officers. They say that the city has set up a process for individualized exemptions but still denies most exceptions based on religious liberty concerns.
“President Biden’s pronouncement that the pandemic is over has done little to reverse the ongoing constitutional nightmare in New York City,” John Bursch, a lawyer for the challengers, argued.
“Moreover, it has been widely reported that a ‘tripandemic’ may loom ahead this winter, greatly increasing the likelihood that the Mandates will remain in place or new ones will replace them,” he argued.

 — 
Tesla drivers will soon be able to take a video call directly from their vehicle’s touchscreen dashboard, Zoom announced Tuesday.
The video call provider announced on Tuesday during its annual Zoom (ZM)topia conference, where it typically teases new features to support remote calls, that its software is coming to Tesla (TSLA)’s built-in infotainment center. In a pre-recorded demo video shown at the event, a Tesla (TSLA) driver is seen taking a Zoom (ZM) call while recharging her vehicle.
After this story initially published, the company told CNN Business the car will need to be parked show video; when the vehicle is in motion, only audio will be enabled. The timing of the launch is still unknown, however.
The feature itself is one that Tesla has been mulling for years. In May 2020, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said in a tweet adding Zoom calls to Tesla vehicles was “definitely a future feature.” In the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic, Musk received a bevvy of tweets that requested Zoom integration; drivers argued it would give them another private space to take calls and make use of the existing driver-facing camera, present in some Teslas, and large display.
At the time, a Zoom spokesperson told pop culture website Mashable that adding support for video calls into its infotainment system would not be the safest use case because many people might attempt to use it while driving.
Zoom also unveiled at Tuesday’s event other new tools, including the integration of email and calendar services directly into the service, a conversational AI and chatbot that helps troubleshoot issues, and support for developers to monetize their apps on Zoom’s App Marketplace.
The Zoom news comes as Tesla faces growing competition in the electric vehicle market from established automakers such as Volkswagen, Ford and General Motors. Some investors have expressed concerns that Musk will be too distracted by his purchase of Twitter to give enough attention to addressing Tesla’s problems.
This week, Musk continued to sell Tesla stock for a total that now nears $4 billion since he acquired Twitter (TWTR). Tesla shares have lost 46% of their value so far this year on disappointing sales caused by supply chain problems.
Musk’s companies haven’t always had a strong relationship with Zoom. SpaceX, for example, banned its employees from using Zoom in April 2020 over “significant privacy and security concerns.”

Mortgage rates rise back above 7%

Mortgage rates have jumped back above 7%, after dropping last week.
The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 7.08% in the week ending November 10, up from 6.95% the week before, according to Freddie Mac. A year ago, the 30-year fixed rate stood at 2.98%.
Mortgage rates have risen throughout most of 2022, spurred by the Federal Reserve’s unprecedented campaign of hiking interest rates in order to tame soaring inflation.
What will my monthly mortgage payment be?
Last week, the Fed announced it would raise interest rates by another 75 basis points, the sixth rate increase this year and the fourth-consecutive hike of that size. While the Labor Department announced Thursday that consumer prices rose in October by 7.7% from a year ago, less than expected, the Fed still has far to go in its effort to tame inflation.
“The housing market is the most interest-rate sensitive segment of the economy, and the impact rates have on homebuyers continues to evolve,” said Sam Khater, Freddie Mac’s chief economist. “Home sales have declined significantly and, as we approach year-end, they are not expected to improve.”
While the Fed does not set the interest rates borrowers pay on mortgages directly, its actions influence them. Mortgage rates tend to track the yield on 10-year US Treasury bonds. As investors see or anticipate rate hikes, they make moves which send yields higher and mortgage rates rise.
Affordability is not improving
With mortgage rates up four percentage points from a year ago, buyers’ purchasing power has plummeted. That has pushed many buyers out of the market and those who remain may need to look at a lower price point or make compromises on the location, size, or condition of a house in order to find one that is affordable.
“The key to making a good decision in this challenging housing market is to be laser focused on what you need now and in the years ahead, so that you can stay in your home long enough that buying is a sound financial decision,” said Danielle Hale, Realtor.com’s chief economist.
Based on September 2021’s median home price and 30-year fixed mortgage rate, a typical homebuyer with a 20% down payment would have been looking at a $1,187 monthly payment last year, according to calculations from Freddie Mac.
This year, due to both higher prices and mortgage rates that are hovering around 7%, a typical buyer is facing a $2,065 monthly payment. That is $878 more a month.
Because of this drastic change in the cost to finance a home, sales have dropped for eight months running, according to the National Association of Realtors. A survey from Fannie Mae showed that only 16% of people think this is a good time to buy a home, a record low.
But last week’s mortgage applications ticked up slightly for the first time in six weeks, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association, indicating that some people are still buying homes.
“The desire for homeownership is strong,” said Bob Broeksmit, president and CEO of the MBA. “Many prospective buyers are waiting for the volatility in mortgage rates to subside, as well as for a clearer picture of the economic outlook.”
The average mortgage rate is based on a survey of conventional home purchase loans for borrowers who put 20% down and have excellent credit, according to Freddie Mac. But many buyers who put down less money up front or have less than perfect credit will pay more.

Elon Musk pleads with advertisers to stay on Twitter

Twitter users are flocking to Mastodon. What is it?

CNN
 — 
Twitter owner Elon Musk pleaded with advertisers to keep using his platform on Wednesday as he sketched out his plans for user verification, content moderation and even his intention to add banking features to Twitter in front of a live audience of over 100,000 users.
During an hour-long Twitter Spaces session attended by representatives from Adidas, Chevron, Kate Spade, Nissan and Walgreens, Musk said he wanted Twitter to “be a force that moves civilization in a positive direction.”
An indicator of success, he said, would be whether his decisions lead to growth in users and advertising, while failure would mean the opposite.
The collection of major advertisers and brands listening to Musk’s remarks underscored the intense interest — and perceptions of risk — generated by Musk’s erratic management of the company over the past week, from launching (and then un-launching) product changes to his sweeping layoffs that hit half the company.
Twitter briefly rolled out gray 'official' check marks. Then Elon Musk changed his mind
To his critics, and to companies that have paused advertising on Twitter, Musk asked to be given a chance.
“I understand if people want to give it a minute and see how things are evolving,” he said. “But really, the best way to see how things are evolving is just use Twitter. And see how your experience has changed. Is it better? Is it worse?”
Musk repeatedly urged skeptics to use the platform while addressing questions about his proposal to offer blue check marks to users who agree to pay $8 a month — a plan whose rollout has been marred by uncertainty and abrupt changes.
Users who pay for Twitter Blue, the platform’s subscription service, will not be required to provide identifying information other than a credit card and a phone number, Musk confirmed. Twitter will eventually default to displaying tweets from Twitter Blue subscribers, while tweets from users who do not pay for a blue check mark, he said, would be relegated to a separate page on the site and effectively buried unless viewers sought out that material.
Brands will be expected to foot the bill for their own verification on Twitter Blue, Musk said. He did not go into specifics about a separate, gray verification badge Twitter is developing for major brands, government accounts and media outlets — a feature the company has said will not be available for purchase but rather bestowed on high-profile accounts to distinguish them from those who paid for blue check marks. On Wednesday Twitter briefly appeared to have rolled out the grey check mark feature for some users, though Musk soon after tweeted that he had “killed it.” A Twitter product manager working on the feature left the door open for its eventual release.
Musk also argued, contrary to some of his critics, that well-resourced purveyors of mis- and disinformation would not be able to game the system because they would quickly run out of phone numbers and credit cards, or eventually tire of the effort.
Musk sought to distill many of the challenges of running a social media platform into a binary.
“Thinking of it as an information problem, truth is signal and falsehood is noise,” he said. “And we want to improve the signal-to-noise ratio as much as possible.”
Elon Musk's Twitter lays off employees across the company
Musk’s expansive plans for Twitter include adding financial products to the mix. It could begin, he said, with Twitter allowing users to pay each other through the platform, with the company setting up each user with an initial gift of $10 to test it out. Over time, Musk added, Twitter will offer the ability for users to transfer money out of its system to third-party banks — and then to market its own banking services.
“The next step would be a money market account so you can get an extremely high yield on your balance,” Musk said, adding that debit cards and checks could also be a part of the plan.
Last week, Twitter submitted registration paperwork to the US government that indicated its intent to join the payments industry, and to comply with certain banking regulations. A copy of the paperwork viewed by CNN showed that the Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network received the registration filing by “Twitter Payments LLC” on Nov. 4. A FinCEN spokesperson declined to comment on Twitter’s filing, which had been first reported by the New York Times on Wednesday.
Musk acknowledged brands’ concerns about the presence of hate speech and other offensive content on the platform.
“I don’t think having hate speech next to an ad is great, obviously,” he said with a chuckle.
Yoel Roth, Twitter’s head of integrity and safety, said Twitter is increasing its investment in ideas to battle hateful content.
“We think there’s a lot of other stuff we can do, from warning messages to interstitials, to reducing the reach of that content, that we haven’t fully explored in the past,” Roth said, vowing to implement those ideas quickly. Twitter has implemented many of these steps in the past, particularly in response to election and Covid-19 misinformation.
Musk said he and his teams are at work changing much of Twitter’s existing codebase, partly to support new features such as longform video. That feature, he said, will initially allow paid users to download 10 minutes of high-definition video before gradually lengthening that time limit to 40 minutes and then several hours.
And he emphasized the importance of Community Notes, formerly known as Birdwatch, a crowdsourced fact-checking feature that Twitter has been testing with some of its users.
Community Notes, he said, “will obviate the need for a lot of the content stuff that’s currently in place, I think.”
The sprawling question-and-answer session occasionally delved into the metaphorical and philosophical.
At one point, Musk appeared to acknowledge that his commitment to “free speech” was not absolute.
“There’s a giant difference between freedom of speech and freedom of reach,” he said.
Musk also described Twitter’s existing verification system as a “lords and peasants situation” and compared it to the American Revolutionary War.
“In the United States, we fought a war to get rid of that stuff,” he said. “Maybe this is a dumb decision, but we’ll see.”

Voters approve Medicaid expansion and a minimum wage increase in these states

'Not the normal midterm election': David Axelrod reacts to voting night trends

CNN
 — 
Voters in several states have approved progressive measures that could not get through a Democratic-led Congress or Republican-dominated statehouses.
More low-income South Dakota residents will have access to Medicaid, and Arizona residents with medical debt will get more protections. Minimum wage workers in Nebraska will get a boost in pay.
Here’s a sampling of the ballot measures:
South Dakota will expand Medicaid in 2023
South Dakota voters voted to broaden Medicaid to roughly 42,500 low-income residents starting in mid-2023. The measure passed 56% to 44%, according to South Dakota Secretary of State data.
“South Dakotans know their families and neighbors deserve health care without going into debt or avoiding check-ups, procedures, and medication they need,” said Kelly Hall, executive director of The Fairness Project, which backed the measure.
It’s the seventh successful effort to expand Medicaid in Republican-led states, which began with the approval of Maine voters in 2017. Ballot initiatives have also passed in Missouri, Oklahoma, Idaho, Nebraska and Utah in recent years.
More than 60 organizations – including the South Dakota Farmers Union, the Greater Sioux Falls Chamber of Commerce and multiple health care and religious groups – endorsed Amendment D. It will open up coverage to adults making less than roughly $19,000 a year.
Currently, childless adults are not eligible for Medicaid in South Dakota, and parents must have very low incomes to qualify – about $1,000 a month for a family of four.
Obamacare is proving popular in red states that didn't expand Medicaid
By expanding Medicaid, South Dakota is expected to receive an additional $328 million in federal funds the first year and generate 4,000 new jobs, according to Zach Marcus, campaign manager for South Dakotans Decide Healthcare, which advocated for the ballot measure. The state’s Legislative Research Council found last year that expansion would save South Dakota $162.5 million over five years.
Many Republican officials opposed the measure, citing its potential future costs. States are responsible for picking up 10% of the health care tab of the expansion enrollees.
South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, a Republican, did not support the initiative, though she has said she will carry it out if voters approve it. An expansion bill failed in a state Senate vote earlier this year.
Until the vote, South Dakota was one of 12 states that had opted not to expand Medicaid. The only remaining states where citizen-led ballot initiatives could be possible are Florida and Wyoming, Hall said.
The minimum wage will rise in Nebraska
Nebraska voters opted to raise the state’s minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2026, up from the current $9 an hour. The vote was 58% to 42% in favor, according to Nebraska Secretary of State data.
It is expected to benefit about 150,000 workers, according to the National Employment Law Project and the Economic Policy Institute, which are both left-leaning groups. Some 75% of the workers are over the age of 20.
The measure will provide these workers with an additional $2,100 in pay, said Kate Wolfe, campaign manager of Raise the Wage Nebraska. More than 25 organizations and lawmakers are in the coalition that supported Initiative 433, which was backed by The Fairness Project.
“Initiative 433 passed tonight because Nebraskans understand that raising the minimum wage is about respecting and rewarding hard work,” Wolfe said.
Voters in 2014 approved a ballot measure to raise the minimum wage to $9 an hour by 2016.
Opponents, however, said that the initiative would hurt businesses in the state and reduce employment opportunities for youth.
“The proposed increase in the initiative is a 66.7% increase over four years,” Bud Synhorst, CEO of the Lincoln Independent Business Association, wrote in a local business publication last month. “That is a radical increase that will be felt across the economy.”
In Nevada, some 54% of voters had cast ballots supporting a state constitutional amendment to increase the minimum wage to $12 an hour by 2024, as of Wednesday afternoon, according to Nevada Secretary of State data. The measure would also remove an existing provision setting different rates for the minimum wage based on whether the employer offers certain health benefits.
Some 46% of voters were opposed to the measure, as of Wednesday evening.
CNN projected on Friday that the amendment will pass.
The state minimum wage is already set to rise to $12 an hour for workers who don’t receive certain health care benefits and $11 an hour for those who do, in 2024.
Supporters of the initiative, Question 2 on the ballot, said that workers should have a constitutional guarantee of a $12 hourly minimum wage, preventing lawmakers from reducing it in the future. Opponents argued the change wasn’t necessary because the state legislature already has the authority to increase the minimum wage.
Medical debt measures approved in Arizona
Voters in Arizona overwhelmingly opted to change some rules governing medical debt owed by residents.
Proposition 209 passed by a 72% to 28% vote, according to Arizona Secretary of State data. It will cap the interest rate on medical debt at 3% and limit wage garnishment for medical debt to a maximum of 30% of earnings.
It will also increase the value of primary residences and cars that would be protected from medical debt collectors to $400,000 and $15,000, respectively, up from $250,000 and $6,000, said Rodd McLeod, spokesperson for Healthcare Rising Arizona, which supported the measure that is also backed by The Fairness Project.
The measure will not forgive any medical debt, McLeod said.
Opponents argued the initiative would hurt consumers. It will make it harder for Arizonans to obtain credit and for businesses in the state to collect on debt, as well as increase interest rates on consumer debt, according to Protect Our Arizona, which had hoped to defeat the measure.
California may not tax the rich
Meanwhile, California’s Proposition 30, which would add a surtax of 1.75% on people making more than $2 million a year, was on its way to failure, 59% to 41%, as of Wednesday evening, according to California Secretary of State data. CNN is not yet projecting a winner.
Most of the funds would have gone to promote zero-emission vehicles and wildfire prevention and control.
The measure was backed largely by Lyft, which, like other ride-share companies, is subject to another state rule requiring that it use mostly zero-emission vehicles by 2030. Opponents, including the state Republican Party, said the ballot measure was an attempt by Lyft to get taxpayers to foot the bill for the company.
Notably, Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom also opposed the measure, appearing in an ad to defeat it.
“Prop 30 is being advertised as a climate initiative, but in reality it was devised by a single corporation to funnel state income taxes to benefit their company,” he said in the ad.
Supporters, which include environmental groups, public interest organizations, unions and a bevy of Democratic officials, said the measure was needed to address climate change in the state. It would generate roughly $100 billion over the next 20-plus years, they said.

Biden to meet Xi on Monday for first high-stakes sit-down with Chinese leader

President Joe Biden will meet Chinese leader Xi Jinping face-to-face on Monday, their first in-person encounter since Biden took office and one that will offer a clarifying opportunity for the world’s most important bilateral relationship.
“The leaders will discuss efforts to maintain and deepen lines of communication between the United States and the PRC, responsibly manage competition, and work together where our interests align, especially on transnational challenges that affect the international community. The two leaders will also discuss a range of regional and global issues,” said White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre in a statement.
US officials are entering the sit-down on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Bali without expectations for major deliverables or even the hope that tensions will be significantly eased.
But they do hope Biden can “build the floor” of a functional relationship that doesn’t tip over into conflict and even allows for productive cooperation in areas like climate and North Korea.
“I don’t in any way think that the two leaders are going to sit down and be able to solve all their differences or problems,” a senior administration official said. “But I do think that we believe that some of these steps could be important along the way.”
Instead of any significant takeaways, US officials hope the two leaders can at least come to a mutual understanding about where they see the relationship between the world’s largest economies. The official said the talks would be “in depth” and “substantive.”
“One of the main objectives is really about deepening their understanding of one another’s priorities and intentions, where possible, with the goal of reducing misunderstandings and misperceptions,” the official said.
Up for discussion will be a sharing of each leaders’ respective views of the US-China relationship, which has deteriorated in recent months after Beijing reacted with fury at House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to self-governing Taiwan.
China cut off most official channels of communication with the United States afterward, though there were sufficient enough contacts to arrange the meeting between Biden and Xi. In those talks, US and Chinese officials discussed the reestablishment of communications.
Biden and Xi have spoken by phone five times since the president entered the White House. They traveled extensively together, both in China and the United States, when both were serving as their country’s vice president.
Both enter Monday’s meeting on the back of significant political events. Biden fared better than expected in US midterm elections and Xi was elevated to an unprecedented third term by the Chinese Communist Party.
US officials declined to speculate on how the two leaders’ political situations might affect the dynamic of their meeting. Instead, they laid out areas they expected to be on the table.
That includes the issue of Taiwan, which Beijing claims. Biden has vowed in the past to use US military force to defend the island from a Chinese invasion. The issue is among the most contentious between Biden and Xi.
Biden will also raise human rights concerns, the official said. The US accuses China of committing genocide against the Muslim minority population in the western Xinjiang province.
Biden will also raise what the US views as China’s harmful economic practices. It’s unclear whether the issue of US tariffs on Chinese goods would arise in the talks.
The president also plans to discuss areas where the two countries can cooperate, including on climate change.
And he will raise the matter of Russia’s war in Ukraine and North Korea’s ongoing provocations — two areas the US is looking for China to assert its influence to prevent further conflict.
The official did not specify what Biden’s message would be on North Korea, saying they didn’t want China to know Biden’s talking points ahead of time.
