 — 
Americans and the Federal Reserve got some welcome news Thursday on inflation.
The Consumer Price Index rose 7.7% for the year ending in October, a much slower pace of increase than the 8% economists had expected and the lowest annual inflation reading since January.
The stock market skyrocketed on the news, with Dow futures surging by more than 800 points on hopes the Fed would dial back its aggressive rate hikes.
While Fed Chair Jerome Powell said earlier this month that the central bank still has “some ways to go” in its battle to tame inflation, sentiment is clearly growing that the Fed may be able to tap the brakes ever so slightly.
Fed funds futures are now pricing in a nearly 80% chance of a half-point increase, at the Fed’s December policymaking meeting, smaller than the three-quarters of a percentage point increases the Fed announced at the previous four meetings.
“Today’s CPI report shows inflation is moving in the right direction,” said Eric Merlis, managing director and co-head of global markets at Citizens. “The report provides ammunition for the Fed to begin pricing in sub-75-basis-point tightenings. This will be a welcome development for the Fed.”
Peak inflation?
On a monthly basis, prices rose by 0.4%. That’s on par with the previous month’s increase of 0.4%. Economists were anticipating the monthly figure to grow, given energy prices marched upward in October amid a move by OPEC+ to slash oil production and ongoing uncertainty in Russia’s war in Ukraine.
There also appeared to be some gains made in a measurement watched even more closely by the Fed: Core CPI, which excludes the more volatile categories of food and energy, measured 6.3% for the year ended in October, down from the 6.6% increase posted in September.
Month-on-month, core CPI increased 0.3%. It had logged monthly increases of 0.6% in both August and September.
How does inflation affect my standard of living?
This period of high inflation is likely reaching an inflection point, said Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM.
“While I expect the Fed to lift the policy rate by 50 basis points at its December meeting, the supersize rate hikes are likely now in the rearview mirror,” he said.
Thursday’s CPI report marked an improvement from a stretch of hotter-than-expected inflation readings, but the pervasiveness of price increases remains problematic for consumers, businesses and the Biden administration.
“Any meaningful relief for household budgets is still somewhere over the horizon,” said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate.
“In categories that are necessities — shelter, food, and energy — we continue to see large and consistent increases,” he said. “The areas posting declines are for the most part either irregular or more discretionary in nature — airfare, used cars, and apparel.”
Year over year, shelter prices are up 6.9%, food prices are up 10.9%, and energy prices are up 17.6%, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Costs for staples such as eggs (up 43%), bread (up 14.8%) and milk (up 14.%) remain elevated.

 — 
Adidas (ADDDF) ended its sneaker partnership with Ye, formerly known as Kanye West, last month after the musician’s anti-Semitic tirade. But Adidas (ADDDF) will continue to sell the lucrative sneaker and apparel line, stripped of the Yeezy name and branding.
The company said it’s the sole owner of all Yeezy line design rights for both existing and future colors and versions. Selling the sneakers under Adidas’ own branding will save the company about $300 million in royalty payments and marketing fees.
“Going forward, we will leverage the existing inventory with the exact plans being developed as we speak,” Adidas finance chief said Wednesday Harm Ohlmeyer.
The Yeezy line was a key product for Adidas and the fallout has hurt the company.
Yeezy products generated nearly $2 billion in sales last year for Adidas accounting for 8% of the company’s total sales, according to Morgan Stanley. The line also helped Adidas get shelf space at major retailers and brought new customers into the stores who purchased other Adidas merchandise.
Ending the partnership cost Adidas more than $250 million in profit and $500 million in lost revenue, the company said Wednesday.
On Tuesday, Adidas said it was appointing a new CEO, tapping the head of Puma to succeed outgoing CEO Kasper Rorsted.
Norwegian Bjørn Gulden, 57, will become CEO of Adidas next year. He will have to find ways to replace Yeezy sales and turn around the brand. Adidas’ stock has dropped around 80% the last two years.
It would be a mistake for Adidas to continue selling the line, said Darcey Jupp, an apparel analyst at GlobalData.
“It should refrain from relaunching items under its own brand, as they will always be synonymous with West, and this would likely result in muted customer demand,” he said in a note to clients.

T. rex skull could sell for $20 million at auction
Published 10th November 2022
Credit: Sotheby's
Written by
Amarachi Orie, CNN
A Tyrannosaurus rex skull is expected to fetch up to $20 million at auction next month, according to Sotheby's.
The skull, which has been named Maximus, is one of the most complete of its kind ever found, the auction house said in a press release Tuesday, adding that it represents a ""rare and important paleontological discovery.""
Weighing over 200 pounds and standing 6 feet and 7.5 inches (2 meters) tall, the colossal skull could become one of the most valuable fossils sold at auction when it is offered at a sale in New York.
The skull, named Maximus, is one of the most complete of its kind ever found, according to Sotheby's. Credit: Sotheby's
Describing the fossil as ""extremely rare,"" the auction house's global head of science and popular culture, Cassandra Hatton, said in a statement that the sale was an ""unprecedented moment.""
Mummified dinosaur's skin was gnashed by ancient crocs
Maximus was discovered on private land in the extensively studied Hell Creek Formation in South Dakota. The skull belonged to an adult dinosaur, and all its ""tooth-bearing jaw elements"" have been preserved along with most of its external bones. The rest of the skeleton was largely destroyed by erosion, as the excavation site had been severely weathered over time, the auction house said.
The preserved skull was found at Hell Creek Formation in Sorth Dakota, though the rest of its skeleton had largely eroded away. Credit: Sotheby's
""This T. rex fossil is an extraordinary discovery,"" said Henry Galiano, a Sotheby's natural history consultant, in a press statement. ""Unearthed in one of the most concentrated areas for T. rex remains, the skull retained much of its original shape and surface characteristics with even the smallest and most delicate bones intact, with an extremely high degree of scientific integrity.
""Without the work of experienced field palaeontologists who carefully collected and preserved this skull, it may have eroded away and been lost to science forever,"" he added.
Fossil auction controversy
Last month marked 25 years since a T. rex nicknamed Sue became the first dinosaur ever to be auctioned, which sold the fossil for $8.36 million. Described by Hutton as ""the largest and most complete T. rex ever discovered,"" Sue was also found at the Hell Creek Formation, which has yielded more T. rex remains than any other location in the world, according to Sotheby's.
In 1997, a T. rex nicknamed Sue became the first dinosaur ever to sell auction, said Sotheby's. Credit: Martin Baumgaertner/Field Museum
The 1997 sale was met with controversy, however, with some experts concerned that specimens in private collections would become unavailable for scientific study. Paleontologists have also argued that the growth of the collectors' market makes it harder for them to carry out excavation work on private land.
Scientists are concerned about the million dollar auction of this dinosaur skeleton
""In many areas where dinosaur fossils are found, it is becoming more difficult for professional paleontologists to obtain permission to collect fossils on private property because of the commercial value of fossils,"" wrote paleontologist John W. Hoganson in a 1998 edition of the North Dakota Geological Survey's newsletter.
It is a debate that has surrounded large fossil auctions ever since. Earlier this year, Sotheby's sold the skeleton of a Gorgosaurus, a relative of the T. rex, for just over $6 million, prompting fresh concerns among experts. It was the only fossil of its kind ever to be offered for private ownership, with the other known specimens all housed in museum collections.
""In my own opinion, there are only cons,"" P. David Polly, a professor and chair of the department of earth and atmospheric sciences at Indiana University Bloomington, told CNN at the time of the Gorgosaurus sale. ""While certainly there is no law in the US that supports this for fossils that come off private land, it's easy for me as a scientist to argue that that fossil is important to all of us, and really ought to be going into a public repository where it can be studied — where the public at large can learn from it and enjoy it.""

US Navy engineer and wife sentenced for conspiring to sell classified information to foreign country
By Mary Kay Mallonee, CNN

 — 
A US Navy nuclear engineer and his wife have each been sentenced to about two decades behind bars for conspiring to sell classified information related to the design of nuclear-powered warships to a foreign country in exchange for thousands of dollars in cryptocurrency.
The Justice Department announced Wednesday that Jonathan Toebbe, 44, of Annapolis, Maryland, was sentenced to more than 19 years. His wife, Diana Toebbe, 46, was sentenced to more than 21 years in prison.
The couple pleaded guilty in February to conspiracy and hoped to get a federal judge in West Virginia to sign off on proposed plea agreements for lesser sentences. Judge Gina Groh rejected the agreements stating that it was not in the best interest of the country to accept the deals in which Jonathan Toebbe could have been sentenced to between 12 and 18 years in prison, while his wife could have been sentenced to up to three years in prison.
The Toebbes pleaded guilty again in September as part of new agreements that exposed them to longer potential sentences, according to court documents.
The couple coordinated drop-offs of encrypted SD cards containing classified information about nuclear submarines, specifically Virginia-class vessels, for who they believed were members of a foreign government in exchange for thousands of dollars in cryptocurrency, according to a criminal complaint.
Prosecutors said the couple went to great lengths to hide the SD cards at the dead-drop locations over the course of several months, tucking an SD card into a Saran-wrapped peanut butter sandwich in one instance, while others were hidden inside a packet of gum and a sealed Band-Aid wrapper.
“The Toebbes conspired to sell restricted defense information that would place the lives of our men and women in uniform and the security of the United States at risk,” said Assistant Attorney General Matthew Olsen of the Justice Department’s National Security Division.

After Hillary lost, she went for a walk in the woods, wrote books, did podcasts & traveled the world advocating for human rights & democracy at large.
She didn’t once call for the Constitution to be terminated.

But do go on about how women are “too emotional to lead” won’t you.

King Charles III unveils first posthumous statue of Queen Elizabeth II
Updated 10th November 2022

Written by
Amarachi Orie, CNN
King Charles III has unveiled the first statue of his late mother Queen Elizabeth II since her death in September.
The new sculpture in the English city of York was revealed on Wednesday outside York Minster, the largest gothic cathedral in Britain, and pays tribute to the late monarch's life of service and dedication.

""When this statue was first planned five years ago, during a reign of unprecedented duration and achievement, it was intended as a celebration of the late Queen's Platinum Jubilee,"" the King said in a speech at a rainy unveiling ceremony while holding a black umbrella.
Print of King Charles III's Balmoral Castle artwork sells for almost 10 times estimate
""Now, as we have witnessed, with great sadness, the passing of that reign, it is unveiled in her memory, as a tribute to a life of extraordinary service and devotion,"" he continued.
""The late Queen was always vigilant for the welfare of her people during her life. Now, her image will watch over what will become Queen Elizabeth Square for centuries to come,"" he added, before pulling down the purple cloth covering the towering statue, which overlooks York's new public square from above one of the cathedral's entrances.

Ahead of the unveiling, Archbishop of York Stephen Cottrell described the ""unique occasion"" as an ""immensely poignant moment"" honoring ""the long life and service of Her Late Majesty Queen Elizabeth to her people, her nation and the Commonwealth.""
'She sat for him 12 times': The Nigerian artist who made a bronze sculpture of Queen Elizabeth II
The Queen died aged 96 on September 8, just months after celebrating an unprecedented seven decades on the throne.
Her commemorative statue, which was designed and carved by York Minster stonemason Richard Bossons, stands at just over six and a half feet tall and weighs around 4,000 pounds.

The French limestone sculpture shows the late Queen in Garter robes, crowned with the George IV State Diadem, and holding the orb and scepter -- symbols of her role as head of church and state.
""She will stand proud and resolute in her niche, welcoming worshippers and visitors alike,"" said Bossons in a statement.
A blemished arrival
Earlier Wednesday, a 23-year-old man was arrested ""on a suspicion of a public order offence"" after eggs were thrown at the King and Queen Consort during their visit to York, according to North Yorkshire police.

None of the eggs hit the royals, who carried on with their engagement, meeting members of the local community.
The man has been interviewed and released on police bail, the force said in an update on Thursday.

Deadly listeria outbreak in 6 states linked to deli meat and cheese

 — 
A deadly outbreak of listeria in six states has been linked to contaminated deli meat and cheese, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced Wednesday.
The truth, and strategy, of food expiration dates
People at high risk of severe illness from listeria infection — such as pregnant people, the elderly and those with weakened immune systems — should not eat meat or cheese from any deli counter without first reheating it “steaming hot,” the agency suggests.
A total of 16 people have been infected, and 13 have been hospitalized, according to reports from six states. One death was reported in Maryland; another person became ill while pregnant and lost their baby, the CDC said in a statement.
To date, seven listeria infections has been reported in New York, three in Maryland, two in Illinois, two in Massachusetts, one in California and one in New Jersey. Those infected ranged in age from from 38 to 92, with an average age of 74. Over half of those sickened were men.
Most of the people identified in the outbreak so far are of Eastern European descent or speak Russian, the CDC said, adding that the agency is still investigating reasons for why the outbreak appears to be disproportionately affecting this population.
However, some infected people who got sick could have recovered without medical care, and thus their cases have gone unreported. “The true number of sick people in this outbreak is likely higher than the number reported, and the outbreak may not be limited to the states with known illnesses,” the CDC added.
In interviewing those sickened, CDC investigators found that five of the seven people in New York purchased sliced deli meat or cheese from at least one location of NetCost Market, a chain of stores selling international foods. However, that is not the only location of the illness, the CDC said, as people sickened in other states reported buying meats or cheeses from other delis.
Listeria monocytogenes is a hardy bacteria that can be easily transferred in food preparation and can be hard to remove, the CDC said.
Deli counters and food processing facilities can be a common source of listeria infection, the CDC said, as listeria can easily spread between food and equipment or surfaces and can be hard to remove.
If you have purchased deli cheese or meat, the agency recommends a careful cleaning of your refrigerator — and any containers or surfaces the meat or cheese may have touched — with hot, soapy water.
“Call your healthcare provider right away if you have any symptoms of severe Listeria illness after eating meat or cheese from a deli,” the CDC said.
Symptoms of listeria usually occur within four weeks of infection but can take as long as 70 days to appear. In some cases, the first signs of infection are diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms. Typical symptoms that follow include headache, stiff neck, fever, muscle pain, confusion, loss of balance and convulsions.
Who’s most at risk
Listeria is the third leading cause of death from food poisoning in the United States, according to the CDC, and is especially dangerous for anyone older than age 65, with a weakened immune system, or pregnant.
How do you know if your chicken is cooked properly? It's complicated, say researchers
Pregnant people are especially at risk. According to the CDC, they are 10 times more likely to get a listeria infection, and the odds are even higher for Hispanic pregnant people, who are 24 times more likely to get listeria.
Pregnant people typically experience only flu-like symptoms, but the danger to a developing fetus is high. Infections during pregnancy can lead to miscarriage, premature delivery or stillbirth. Newborns with listeria infection can develop blood infections, meningitis, and other serious and potentially life-threatening complications.
A listeria infection is treated with antibiotics.

University of Kentucky student who repeatedly hurled racist slur at Black student permanently banned from campus

 — 
The student facing assault charges after she repeatedly hurled a racial slur at a Black student on campus early Sunday morning has been permanently banned from campus and could face additional charges, the University of Kentucky president said.
Sophia Rosing – who is no longer a student – was initially suspended on an interim basis, and is now no longer a student, permanently banned from campus, and will not be eligible to re-enroll as a student, the message from University of Kentucky (UK) President Eli Capilouto to the UK community said.
Black University of Kentucky student in viral video says she was 'physically, verbally and racially assaulted'
“Although she is no longer a student, we must continue our investigations,” Capilouto continued.
“That includes our cooperation with an investigation into criminal charges filed; our Code of Student Conduct disciplinary proceedings and racial harassment misconduct being reviewed by our Office of Institutional Equity and Equal Opportunity.”
“As a community working wholeheartedly to prevent racist violence, we also must be committed to holding people accountable for their actions. The processes we have in place are essential,” he continued.
On Tuesday, Rosing’s attorney, Fred Peters, told CNN that she plans to withdraw from UK in the next couple of days and that she is “very embarrassed, very remorseful, very humiliated.”
Rosing has been charged with alcohol intoxication in a public place, fourth-degree assault without visible injury, second-degree disorderly conduct, and third-degree assault on a police officer or probation officer, according to Kimberly Baird, the Fayette County Commonwealth’s Attorney.

‘We desperately need money,’ climate envoy Kerry tells CNN amid criticism of his emission credits plan

John Kerry: Climate should not be about conflict with China
02:48 - Source: CNN
CNN
 — 
US climate envoy John Kerry on Thursday defended his plan to raise cash for climate action by selling carbon emission offsets to companies, telling CNN there was “not enough money in any country in the world to actually solve this problem.”
Speaking to CNN at the COP27 climate summit in Egypt, Kerry said the world cannot avoid the worst effects of the climate crisis without private money – because governments are not willing to pay what’s needed.
Kerry’s plan to finance the renewable energy transition in vulnerable countries by allowing companies to pay for someone else to cut their planet-warming emissions, instead of cutting their own, raised concerns among climate experts. Many have warned that selling carbon credits could discourage companies from making real cuts to emissions.
The US-China climate deal was a rare bright spot in an otherwise thorny relationship. Should it be mended?
But Kerry has made his view clear.
“We desperately need money,” Kerry told CNN. “It takes trillions and no government that I know of is ready to put trillions into this on an annual basis,” he added.
“I am absolutely convinced that it is one of the few ways that we have to be able to produce the amount of capital we need to accelerate this transition.”
United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned on Tuesday that “shadow markets for carbon credits cannot undermine genuine emission reduction efforts.”
Kerry admitted that carbon trading can be problematic when there aren’t “sufficient rules or guardrails and you don’t have environmental integrity,” but said he wants to set up a system that would be tightly controlled.
“I met with the Secretary-General yesterday, and he was very clear he doesn’t object to all of them,” Kerry said, referring to carbon offset programs. “He objects to the ones that are ripping things off, but we talked about the tightest possible accountability, and I am absolutely convinced that it is one of the few ways that we have to be able to produce the amount of capital we need to accelerate this transition.”
The International Energy Agency said last month that governments must triple their annual clean energy investments to $4 trillion by 2030 if the world is to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. But it only expects global investments in low-carbon energy to increase to $2 trillion a year until the end of the decade.

President Joe Biden said Twitter owner and Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s relationship with other countries was “worthy of being looked at,” but declined to say how that could be done.
“I think that Elon Musk’s cooperation and/or technical relationships with other countries is worthy of being looked at, whether or not he is doing anything inappropriate,” Biden said, when asked if Musk was a threat to national security. “But that’s all I’ll say.”
When a reporter in the room asked, “How?” the President responded: “There’s a lot of ways.”
Twitter stock falls after report says Biden admin weighing security review of Musk ventures
Just before Musk completed his $44-billion acquisition, Bloomberg reported that Biden administration officials were in early discussions about possibly subjecting some of Musk’s ventures to national security reviews, including the Twitter takeover. Asked by CNN at the time, the administration pushed back on the report, which cited people familiar with the matter.
“We do not know of any such conversations,” National Security Council Spokesperson Adrienne Watson said in a statement. A Treasury spokesperson said the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States “does not publicly comment on transactions that it may or may not be reviewing” by law and practice.
Among the equity investors who committed to provide financing to help Musk fund the deal are several foreign entities, including the Qatar sovereign wealth fund and Saudi Arabian Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, who was already one of Twitter’s largest investors prior to Musk’s proposed takeover.

CNN Business
 — 
Americans and the Federal Reserve got some welcome news Thursday on inflation.
The Consumer Price Index rose 7.7% for the year ending in October, a much slower pace of increase than the 8% economists had expected and the lowest annual inflation reading since January.
The stock market skyrocketed on the news, with Dow futures surging by more than 800 points on hopes the Fed would dial back its aggressive rate hikes.
While Fed Chair Jerome Powell said earlier this month that the central bank still has “some ways to go” in its battle to tame inflation, sentiment is clearly growing that the Fed may be able to tap the brakes ever so slightly.
Fed funds futures are now pricing in a nearly 80% chance of a half-point increase, at the Fed’s December policymaking meeting, smaller than the three-quarters of a percentage point increases the Fed announced at the previous four meetings.
“Today’s CPI report shows inflation is moving in the right direction,” said Eric Merlis, managing director and co-head of global markets at Citizens. “The report provides ammunition for the Fed to begin pricing in sub-75-basis-point tightenings. This will be a welcome development for the Fed.”
Peak inflation?
On a monthly basis, prices rose by 0.4%. That’s on par with the previous month’s increase of 0.4%. Economists were anticipating the monthly figure to grow, given energy prices marched upward in October amid a move by OPEC+ to slash oil production and ongoing uncertainty in Russia’s war in Ukraine.
There also appeared to be some gains made in a measurement watched even more closely by the Fed: Core CPI, which excludes the more volatile categories of food and energy, measured 6.3% for the year ended in October, down from the 6.6% increase posted in September.
Month-on-month, core CPI increased 0.3%. It had logged monthly increases of 0.6% in both August and September.
How does inflation affect my standard of living?
This period of high inflation is likely reaching an inflection point, said Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM.
“While I expect the Fed to lift the policy rate by 50 basis points at its December meeting, the supersize rate hikes are likely now in the rearview mirror,” he said.
Thursday’s CPI report marked an improvement from a stretch of hotter-than-expected inflation readings, but the pervasiveness of price increases remains problematic for consumers, businesses and the Biden administration.
“Any meaningful relief for household budgets is still somewhere over the horizon,” said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate.
“In categories that are necessities — shelter, food, and energy — we continue to see large and consistent increases,” he said. “The areas posting declines are for the most part either irregular or more discretionary in nature — airfare, used cars, and apparel.”
Year over year, shelter prices are up 6.9%, food prices are up 10.9%, and energy prices are up 17.6%, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Costs for staples such as eggs (up 43%), bread (up 14.8%) and milk (up 14.%) remain elevated.

 — 
Having previously swum in the world’s coldest waters wearing just his swimming trunks, for his latest challenge Lewis Pugh went to the opposite extreme.
When he became the first person to swim across the Red Sea last month – a feat which took 16 days and saw him encounter crashing waves, busy shipping channels and extraordinary sea life – Pugh toiled against what was by far the warmest ocean he’s ever experienced.
As the sun beat down on his back and the water temperature sometimes crept above 30 degrees Celsius (86 degrees Farenheit), Pugh found himself battling exhaustion and dehydration – even when he restricted himself to swimming at the coolest times of the day.
“It’s a significant challenge,” he tells CNN Sport, “and the challenge comes because one feels just so weak and lacking in energy.”
Pugh, an endurance swimmer from the United Kingdom, is accustomed to tackling extreme conditions in some of the world’s most remote oceans.
But the marathon swim from Tiran Island in Saudi Arabia to Hurghada in Egypt posed a myriad of difficulties, not least because it involved weaving through shipping traffic in the Gulf of Suez – the stretch of water connecting the Suez Canal to the Red Sea.
And if negotiating a steady stream of oil tankers and freight containers wasn’t problematic enough, Pugh was also buffeted by big, rolling waves as he fought against choppy waters for the majority of the swim.
Lewis Pugh had to contend with large shipping vessels while swimming across the Red Sea.
In total, he covered a distance of roughly 76 miles (123 kilometers) from October 11-26, swimming between 3.5 and 7.5 miles each day.
“My body is really, really hammered,” says Pugh, about a week after finishing the swim. “Every single day, these waves were crashing up against me … It was just twisting my body backwards and forwards, backwards and forwards.”
The swim also carried the ever-present risk of encountering a shark, of which there around 40 different species in the Red Sea, according to Pugh; the most dangerous are hammerheads, oceanic whitetips, oceanic blacktips and tiger sharks.
As protection, the underside of Pugh’s support boat was equipped with an electronic device capable of repelling sharks within a four-meter radius, meaning any run-ins were few and far between.
But the sea life Pugh did witness at close quarters left him mesmerized by its beauty.
“When you swim across these coral reefs, it’s absolutely unbelievable because the colors are so vibrant – the yellows, the purples, the greens, and then all the wildlife that lives in them,” he says.
Pugh completed his swim across the Red Sea -- home to some of the world's most biodiverse coral reefs -- in 16 days.
For sections of the swim, Pugh was joined by open-water swimmer Mariam Saleh Bin Laden – who became the first Arab, first Saudi and first woman to swim from Saudi Arabia to Egypt – and Egyptian swimmer Mostafa Zaki.
The purpose of the swim was to shine a spotlight on the world’s coral reefs – home to the earth’s most vibrant marine ecosystems – and their precarious status amid the climate crisis.
Scientists have predicted that about 70% to 90% of all living coral will disappear in the next 20 years in the face of rising sea temperatures.
According to findings from an Australian government agency published earlier this year, warming waters have already caused coral bleaching in 91% of reefs surveyed along the Great Barrier Reef.
Pugh, a leading figure in marine protection as the UN Patron of the Oceans, says the coral and wildlife in the Red Sea have adapted to the high water temperatures over thousands of years, making it home to some of the most resistant coral in the world.
But other places tell a different story.
“I did a swim a few years ago across the width of the Maldives – a group of islands in the middle of the Indian Ocean – and I remember just swimming over these coral reefs, and they were absolutely unbelievable,” says Pugh.
“I went back 10 years later. The water had risen; the temperature of the water had risen just a little bit; the animals had all but disappeared, and that coral was completely white, bleached, dead.”
Pugh's swim went from Saudi Arabia's Tiran Island to Hurghada in Egypt.
This week, Pugh has traveled to the COP27 climate summit in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt – a location he passed during his swim across the Red Sea.
There, he plans to speak with world leaders about the gravity of the climate crisis and what it means for the future of the planet – just as he did at last year’s COP26 in Glasgow, Scotland, after swimming across Greenland’s Ilulissat Icefjord.
“I see the polar regions and the coral reefs of the world as the two ground zeros of the climate crisis,” says Pugh. “And the reason why I say this is because it’s so evident in these parts of the world that we have a very, very serious crisis.”
Part of the reason for Pugh’s long-distance swims is to persuade world leaders to introduce marine protected areas.
In 2015, for example, he swam down the Ross Sea in Antarctica, which today contains a protected area spanning 1.55 million square kilometers – the largest such area in the world at roughly the size of the United Kingdom, Germany, France and Italy combined.
But Pugh also wants the swims to tell stories about parts of the world which are often overlooked.
“When you see damage on land, it’s so very, very evident,” he says. “Underwater, it’s much more challenging. With these swims, I tried to take people – take the public, take the media, take world leaders – to the scene of the crime and show them what’s happening and explain why it’s important that we protect these places.”
Still recovering from his Red Sea swim, Pugh is unsure of the next ocean he will plunge into wearing just his swimming briefs. For now, he is focused on COP27 and the promises made by the world’s leaders in the face of the climate crisis.
“We need to have commitments which are much shorter, much sharper,” says Pugh. “And our commitments need to be far greater than what I’ve seen before.”

Thanksgiving is two weeks away. Get your updated Covid-19 shot now, health officials warn

How vaccines stop the spread of viruses
01:26 - Source: CNN
CNN
 — 
With Thanksgiving just two weeks away, people who are eligible for an updated Covid-19 vaccine booster but still haven’t received the shot will need to roll up their sleeves Thursday to get as much protection as possible before the holiday.
Health officials are worried about a possible surge in respiratory illnesses this winter – including Covid-19, flu, RSV and rhinoviruses – and they are urging people who are not up-to-date on their Covid-19 shots to get vaccinated as soon as possible.
“The way it makes protection is to create these proteins, which we call antibodies, that then circulate in the bloodstream. Well, that can’t be done with a snap of the finger. There’s a biological process that takes place,” said Dr. William Schaffner, a professor in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center and medical director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases.
After getting the updated Covid-19 vaccine, that biological process can take about 10 to 14 days.
Covid-19 boosters could prevent about 90,000 US deaths this winter, but only if more people get them, analysis suggests
“So it starts right away, and gradually you get more and more of these antibodies into your bloodstream until, by about two weeks, you’re close to having a maximum,” Schaffner said. “The booster actually functions as a booster: You get an increase in antibody that’s faster than if you started from scratch.”
The rollout of the updated boosters has been sluggish, and there’s some urgency to building protection before gathering with family and friends for the holidays – the first festive season of the pandemic since most prevention measures, including masks and social distancing, largely became things of the past.
In October, White House Covid-19 Response Coordinator Dr. Ashish Jha said that getting the updated Covid-19 vaccine is “the most important thing” Americans can do for their health right now.
“The most important thing every American can do to reduce their likelihood of having significant, preventable health issues in the next three to six months is to go get an updated Covid vaccine,” Jha said. “Beyond that, we need to make sure that everyone over the age of 50 or otherwise with high-risk conditions gets treatments if they do get infected. We have treatments widely available.”
Uptake of updated Covid-19 booster remains slow
As colder weather arrives, people spend more time indoors and more holiday celebrations are planned, concern mounts among local health officials that there will be some uptick in the spread of Covid-19, flu and RSV in the weeks ahead, said Lori Tremmel Freeman, chief executive officer of the National Association of County and City Health Officials.
That concern is heightened even more because relatively few people across the United States have gotten the updated Covid-19 vaccine booster that is now available for those 5 and older.

Will approaching winter mean new Covid-19 surge?
“The message from the local health departments on this is that you should by now – if you are eligible and able – be getting your booster to protect you through the holidays,” Freeman said.
“The longer that time goes on since you’ve received your last booster, the more that your immunity wanes and the more susceptible you become again to getting sick with the virus,” she said. “So all those things together spell out that we have prevention to do right now as we get ready for the end of the year and the holiday season upon us.”
Less than 10% of the US population – about 26 million people 5 and older – has gotten an updated Covid-19 booster dose, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Coverage is highest among older adults: More than 1 in 5 seniors who got their primary series have also gotten an updated booster, compared with about 1 in 15 adults under the age of 30.
But the pace of uptake is relatively slow.
About 1 in 5 adults who have their primary series say they will probably or definitely not get the updated booster – a share that has been consistent since at least September, CDC data shows.
What to know about getting updated Covid-19 booster, flu shot at the same time
“What clearly will happen if we still don’t have widespread acceptance of this Covid booster is that the anticipated increase that we expect with Covid this winter will increase even more,” Schaffner said. “So we could make the season worse from the point of view of more serious disease.”
He added that with rising flu activity, an ongoing surge in RSV and the growing concerns around a possible increase in Covid-19 this winter, that is why it will be important to get vaccinated against Covid-19 and flu ahead of the holidays – and to make sure those around you will be vaccinated, washing their hands and staying home when sick.
“You could have a rule: You’re all welcome at the Thanksgiving table, for example, if you’re vaccinated and not only against Covid, against influenza, too,” Schaffner said.
Health officials say it’s fine to get the updated Covid-19 booster and flu vaccine at the same time.
Flu activity continues to ramp up
Flu is already spreading at high levels in some areas.
Last week, government health officials warned of an early and severe start to cold and flu season in the United States, saying they were closely monitoring hospital capacity and medical supplies and were ready to send help if needed.
“We suspect that many children are being exposed to some respiratory viruses now for the first time, having avoided these viruses during the height of the pandemic,” said Dr. Jose Romero, director of the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases.
Flu 'gathering speed' across US as health officials and doctors prepare for a potentially rough season
Across the United States, cases of RSV and influenza are increasing. At the same time, Covid-19 cases, which had been dropping, appear to have plateaued over the past three weeks, Romero said. A raft of new variants has been gaining ground against BA.5, the Omicron subvariant that caused a wave of illness over the summer.
Looking ahead, some vaccine makers, including Novavax and Pfizer and BioNTech, are developing two-in-one combination vaccines that will offer protection against both flu and Covid-19 in a single shot.
Last week, Pfizer and BioNTech announced that the first study participant has received a dose of their investigational flu-Covid combination vaccine in a Phase 1 trial. The vaccine candidate contains components of the companies’ updated Covid-19 booster and their investigational flu vaccine.
In October, Novavax announced that its Covid-19 and flu combination vaccine generated immune responses against coronavirus and influenza strains, showing “positive results” in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial. That trial is “the first of its kind” to evaluate a Covid-flu combination vaccine, the company said, and insights from the trial will inform a Phase 2 study that’s expected to start by the end of this year. The investigational vaccine is a two-in-one combination of Novavax’s Covid-19 vaccine and its quadrivalent flu vaccine candidate.
Moderna is also developing a combined flu and Covid-19 mRNA vaccine and another combination vaccine targeting flu, Covid-19 and RSV.

Health officials have long suspected that Covid-19 vaccinations will be needed annually in the future, similar to how seasonal flu vaccines are given each year.
A combination vaccine could be available as soon as for the next flu season, Freeman said, making it easier for people to roll up their sleeves on an annual basis.
“We may see as early as next year,” she said. “And that will help make it easier for people to make that choice to get both their flu and Covid either together in one vaccine or together at once wherever they’re able to get their vaccine.”

Biden aims to assert American leadership abroad at UN climate summit and G20
By Kevin Liptak, CNN
Updated 11:20 PM EST, Thu November 10, 2022

 — 
It’s a story President Joe Biden tells at nearly every opportunity: last year, meeting his new counterparts at his first international summit, he proudly informed them, “America is back.”
“For how long?” one of them asked.
As Biden departs this week for a weeklong around-the-world trip, the question still resonates.
“They’re very concerned that we are still the open democracy we’ve been and that we have rules and the institutions matter,” Biden said Wednesday during a news conference.
Biden hopes his stops at a climate meeting here on the Red Sea, a gathering of Southeast Asian nations in Cambodia and a high-stakes Group of 20 summit on the Indonesian island of Bali will assert American leadership in areas former President Donald Trump either ignored or actively shunned.
“If the United States tomorrow were to, quote, withdraw from the world, a lot of things would change around the world. A whole lot would change,” Biden said ahead of his trip.
He and his advisers believe they are entering the series of high-stakes meetings with a solid argument his version of the US role in the world will endure. He resisted historical and political headwinds in this year’s midterm elections while many of Trump’s handpicked candidates lost. And over the past year, he secured passage of a major climate investment and rallied the world behind efforts to support Ukraine and isolate Russia.
Yet the anxieties of American allies persist over the future of US commitments – to Ukraine, to fighting climate change, to treaty partners and, perhaps most urgently, to upholding Democratic norms. Foreign diplomats have watched intently as the midterm political season played out, searching for clues at how the American electorate was judging Biden’s first two years in office and reporting back to their capitals on voter dissatisfaction that could fuel Trump’s return to office.
Republicans appeared to be moving toward gaining control of the House of Representatives as of Wednesday night. And Trump is readying a third presidential bid, potentially to be announced while Biden is on the opposite side of the planet.
White House aides have not voiced concern at the potential split-screen, believing foreign policy to be among the president’s strengths, particularly when compared to Trump’s chaotic style of diplomacy.
“We just have to demonstrate that he will not take power,” Biden said Wednesday. “If he does run, making sure he, under legitimate efforts of our Constitution, does not become the next president again.”
Presidents have often turned to foreign policy, where they can act with relatively few congressional restraints, at moments of domestic political turmoil. President Barack Obama launched a similar tour of Asia after his self-described “shellacking” in the 2010 midterms.
Four defining global threats will loom over Biden’s trip: Russia’s war in Ukraine, escalating tensions with China, the existential problem of climate change and the potential for a global recession in the coming months. Other flashpoints, like North Korea’s rapidly accelerating provocations and uncertainty over Iran’s nuclear program, will also factor in.
Of those, defending Ukraine and combating climate change could be the most impacted by results from this week’s election.
At the G20 summit, Biden hopes to rally leaders from the world’s developed economies behind his 10-month effort to isolate and punish Russia for its invasion of Ukraine. He isn’t planning to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin, who won’t be attending the meeting in person and is considering whether to participate virtually.
Global economic headwinds have tested international resolve for the pressure campaign, however, and world leaders have worked with varying levels of intensity toward finding a diplomatic end to the conflict.
Some Trump-aligned House Republicans have called for cutting funding to Ukraine, though other GOP defense hawks have vowed not to abandon the country amid its war with Russia.
House Republican Leader McCarthy, in an interview with CNN this week, attempted to reaffirm his support for Ukraine while saying they would not automatically rubber stamp any additional requests for aid.
“I’m very supportive of Ukraine,” McCarthy said. “I think there has to be accountability going forward. … You always need, not a blank check, but make sure the resources are going to where it is needed. And make sure Congress, and the Senate, have the ability to debate it openly.”
At the United Nations climate summit in Egypt, Biden arrives having signed the largest US investment in fighting climate change ever, a dramatically different scenario from previous international meetings – including last year’s gathering in Scotland – where American commitments to carbon reduction weren’t backed by law.
“We’ve seen the United States go from a global laggard to a global leader in less than 18 months,” a senior administration official said this week.
The $375 billion commitment will provide Biden leverage as he works to convince other countries to step up their own efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, all with the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.
In his speech, Biden will call on nations to “really keep their eyes on the ball when it comes to accelerating ambitious action to reduce emissions,” the official said. And he will highlight his administration’s intent to propose a rule this week requiring large federal contractors to develop carbon reduction targets and disclose their greenhouse gas emissions, leveraging the federal government’s purchasing power to combat climate change in the private sector and bolster vulnerable supply chains.
But Republicans have said they will work to repeal parts of the law, and have accused Biden of contributing to rising energy prices by blocking the extraction of fossil fuels, which contribute to climate change.
When Trump was president, he withdrew the US altogether from the Paris Climate Accord, the agreement leaders are meeting to discuss the week.
Even absent the American political uncertainty, there are concerns rising energy costs and a looming recession could dampen resolve toward transitioning to cleaner energy. US officials have moderated expectations for this year’s summit, which Biden is only expected to attend for a few hours.
In Congress, Biden has achieved more bipartisan success in his efforts to counter China, the other major issue he will confront this week. A recently passed law meant to bolster the American semiconductor industry earned Republican and Democratic votes, partly because it promised to wean the US off its dependence on Chinese products.
Biden’s aides worked over the past month to arrange his first face-to-face meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping since taking office, even as tensions simmer between Washington and Beijing. The meeting will take place on Monday at the G20 in Indonesia. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit in August to self-governing Taiwan enraged Chinese leaders and led to a near-shutoff of communication with the US.
Biden said Wednesday he and Xi would lay out “what each of our red lines are” and discuss issues they each believe are in their own “critical national interests” during the meeting.
In his recently released National Security Strategy, Biden identified China as “America’s most consequential geopolitical challenge,” and he hopes an in-person meeting with Xi – who has just resumed international travel following the Covid-19 pandemic – can help establish lines of communication.
Xi arrives at the G20 fresh from an historic Communist Party conference that elevated him to an unprecedented third term – a sharp contrast to Biden’s current political situation.
It’s not yet clear how that disparity will manifest in Bali.
“The big question is are the two leaders going to come in a sort of more conciliatory mode or sort of a more defiant one,” said Matthew Goodman, senior vice president at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.
“They’ve both gotten through their political events of the year and they might come in a little more liberated for one reason or another to try to reach out and find common ground,” Goodman said. “There are the kind of global challenges that really affect both the US and China – whether it’s growth, or pandemics, or climate change. And so there’s possibility of some kind of conciliatory approach from both sides.”

(CNN) — More than 1,300 flights have been canceled Thursday after Tropical Storm Nicole made landfall in Florida, packing winds of up to 75 miles per hour.
Data from flight tracking site FlightAware showed that, as of about 3 p.m. ET, carriers in the United States had canceled 1,353 flights, affecting both international and domestic services.
More than 900 flights had been canceled Wednesday.
Orlando International Airport was the most impacted destination, according to FlightAware. The airport closed on Wednesday and was assessing damage on Thursday. The airport had not reopened as of about 3 p.m. ET on Thursday.
The passenger terminal at Orlando Sanford International Airport remained closed on Thursday. The airport anticipates reopening on Friday morning.
Melbourne Orlando International Airport also closed Wednesday. Operations were expected to resume there sometime Thursday afternoon.
Daytona Beach International Airport was also closed and expected to reopen at 4 a.m. ET on Friday.
Palm Beach International Airport, which closed on Wednesday afternoon, was slated to reopen at 8 a.m. ET on Thursday.
Miami International Airport and Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport have experienced some delays and cancellations but remained open.
The storm also led to phased closures of Florida theme parks on Wednesday, with Walt Disney World parks in Orlando and Universal Orlando Resort among those affected. Disney World parks planned a phased reopening on Thursday, starting at noon. Universal Orlando also anticipated a phased reopening Thursday.
Nicole made landfall just south of Vero Beach as a category 1 hurricane with winds of 75 mph, but has now weakened to a tropical storm, according to the National Hurricane Center.

Suspended Nets guard Kyrie Irving meets with NBA commissioner Adam Silver, per reports, as Brooklyn blows out Knicks

 — 
Suspended Brooklyn Nets star Kyrie Irving reportedly met with NBA commissioner Adam Silver on Tuesday, according to multiple reports, including one from the Athletic’s Shams Charania, citing unnamed sources.
According to Charania, Silver and Irving met and had “a productive and understanding visit,” as Irving and the Nets work toward his return to the court.
CNN has reached out to the NBA, the Nets and Irving’s representatives but has not heard back.
Irving was suspended a minimum of five games without pay by the Nets last week, after posting a Twitter link to a documentary containing antisemitic messages, and his initial refusal to issue an apology. He missed his fourth game Wednesday night – a 112-85 Nets blowout of their crosstown rivals, the New York Knicks.

The 30-year-old posted an apology on his Instagram following his suspension from the team.
“To All Jewish families and Communities that are hurt and affected from my post, I am deeply sorry to have caused you pain, and I apologize,” Irving wrote. “I initially reacted out of emotion to being unjustly labeled Anti-Semitic, instead of focusing on the healing process of my Jewish Brothers and Sisters that were hurt from the hateful remarks made in the Documentary.
“I had no intentions to disrespect any Jewish cultural history regarding the Holocaust or perpetuate any hate. I am learning from this unfortunate event and hope we can find understanding between us all,” Irving continued.
Last week, Silver said he was planning to meet with Irving and was “disappointed” after the guard did not offer an apology nor denounce the “harmful content contained in the film he chose to publicize.”

Brooklyn Nets general manager Sean Marks told the media last Friday that Irving would need to pass “some remedial steps and measures” for the star to rejoin the team.
Marks said in part, “(Steps) have been put in place for him to obviously seek some counseling … from dealing with some anti-hate and some Jewish leaders within our community. He’s going to have to sit down with them, he’s going to have to sit down with the organization after this, and we’ll evaluate and see if this is the right opportunity to bring him back.”
The Nets reportedly outlined “six-action items” he must complete in order to return to the team, according to the Athletic, citing unnamed league sources.
The six steps are: Irving must apologize and condemn the film he promoted, make a $500,000 donation to anti-hate causes, complete sensitivity training, as well as anti-Semitism training, meet with the ADL and Jewish leaders and meet with team owner Joe Tsai “to demonstrate an understanding of the situation.”
New coach Vaughn leads Nets to big win
Irving missed his fourth game on Wednesday when the Nets hosted the Knicks at Barclays Center in Brooklyn.
Before the game, the Nets named assistant coach Jacque Vaughn as their next permanent head coach. Vaughn was the interim head coach after Brooklyn parted ways with former head coach Steve Nash last week after a disappointing 2-5 start.
And, with Vaughn instilled as the permanent head coach, the Nets looked much more like themselves on Wednesday, easily beating their rivals 112-85 behind a triple-double from Kevin Durant.
The 2014 NBA MVP finished with 29 points, 12 rebounds and 12 assists, while being ably helped by some of his teammates.
Seth Curry chipped in 23 points off the bench while Edmond Sumner had 18 points as the Nets’ record improved to 5-7.
Durant expressed how “excited” he was for Vaughn after the victory.

“I know the work that he puts in every day. I know how much he cares about the development of each player, and this team as a whole,” the 34-year-old told the media. “Look forward to playing for him. All the guys have responded to how he wants us to play, so I’m looking forward to how we progress after this.”
When asked what the team has been going through over recent weeks, Durant said: “We were struggling, we’ve been through a lot.
“Guys got pride, individual pride, and we just wanted to come out and play better. That’s what we’ve been doing. We don’t want this to be a honeymoon stage for us, we want to continue to keep pushing through, keep finding ways to get better, finding ways to turn those weaknesses into strengths and keep pushing from here.”
Julius Randle led the way for the Knicks with 24 points and 11 rebounds, as their record slips to 5-6.

GET '5 THINGS' IN YOUR INBOX
If your day doesn’t start until you’re up to speed on the latest headlines, then let us introduce you to your new favorite morning fix. Sign up here for the ‘5 Things’ newsletter.
Election officials cautiously went into the midterms this week bracing for the possibility of harassment and hostility at some polling places. Luckily, voting went smoothly across the US – even after two years that election-deniers bragged that they would flood the polls with observers to find fraud.
Here’s what else you need to know to Get Up to Speed and On with Your Day.
(You can get “5 Things You Need to Know Today” delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.)
1. Midterms
Control of Congress remains undetermined as results continue to trickle in from Senate races in Arizona and Nevada. Georgia’s contest is also heading to a runoff on December 6 after neither Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock nor Republican challenger Herschel Walker surpassed the 50% threshold needed to win the race outright. In the House, it could be days until a full picture emerges as votes are still being counted in states like California, Oregon, Nevada and Arizona. Although Republicans are inching toward a slim majority in the House, President Joe Biden called the midterm vote “a good day for democracy” and praised Democrats’ efforts to stave off resounding GOP wins. “While any seat lost is painful… Democrats had a strong night,” he said.
2. Tropical Storm Nicole
Nicole made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane just south of Vero Beach, Florida, early this morning, packing winds of 75 mph, according to the National Hurricane Center. While it has weakened to a tropical storm, Nicole is expected to lash the state with heavy rain and storm surge for the next several hours. Nicole’s colossal path has already caused power outages for nearly 110,000 customers and has prompted the closures of many schools, colleges and universities as well as the cancellation of hundreds of flights and the shuttering of amusement parks. Additionally, some residents evacuated their homes after they were deemed unsafe and at risk of collapse due to the storm’s impact. You can track the storm’s path here.

3. Ukraine
Russia has ordered its troops to retreat from the key city of Kherson, the only regional capital it has captured since start of its war in Ukraine. This is a dramatic setback for Russian President Vladimir Putin, as Ukrainian forces approach the city from two directions. The withdrawal “demonstrates the courage, the determination, the commitment of Ukrainian armed forces and also the importance of the continued support” of the West, NATO Secretary General Stoltenberg told CNN. This comes as a top US general said Russia has suffered more than 100,000 killed and wounded soldiers as a result of the invasion – and Ukraine is probably looking at similar numbers.

4. Marijuana
Ballot measures that will legalize marijuana are expected to pass in two states and fail in three others, CNN projects, as momentum has grown nationwide to push for lifting penalties once associated with cannabis. Voters in Arkansas, North Dakota and South Dakota rejected measures that would have allowed certain amounts of cannabis possession and recreational consumption for people 21 and older. CNN projects Maryland and Missouri will approve measures to legalize recreational marijuana use. In Maryland specifically, individuals who were previously convicted of cannabis possession and intent to distribute will also be able to apply for record expungement. Recreational use of marijuana is currently legal in 19 states – along with Washington, DC.
5. Listeria outbreak
The CDC issued a warning Wednesday about a deadly listeria outbreak in six states that has been linked to contaminated deli meat and cheese. People at high risk of severe illness from listeria infection – such as pregnant people, the elderly and those with weakened immune systems – should not eat meat or cheese from any deli counter without first reheating it “steaming hot,” the CDC said in a statement. At least one death was reported in Maryland and 16 people have been infected, according to reports from six states. If you have recently purchased deli cheese or meat, the agency recommends a careful cleaning of your refrigerator – and any containers or surfaces the meat or cheese may have touched – with hot, soapy water.

That’s how many female governors the US will have in 2023, setting a new record for the nation. While the number still represents a small fraction of the top executives across the 50 states, it beats the previous record of nine female governors serving concurrently in 2004, according to the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University.
TODAY’S QUOTE
“Maybe this is a dumb decision, but we’ll see.”
– Elon Musk, backing his plan to offer blue check marks to Twitter users who agree to pay $8 a month – a strategy that has been marred by uncertainty and abrupt changes. During a Twitter Spaces session on Wednesday, Musk pleaded with advertisers to keep using his platform to “see how things evolve.” Twitter currently appears to be battling a wave of celebrity and corporate impersonators on its platform who have quickly gamed the company’s new paid verification system.

 — 
Americans and the Federal Reserve got some welcome news Thursday on inflation.
The Consumer Price Index rose 7.7% for the year ending in October, a much slower pace of increase than the 8% economists had expected and the lowest annual inflation reading since January.
The stock market skyrocketed on the news, with Dow futures surging by more than 800 points on hopes the Fed would dial back its aggressive rate hikes.
While Fed Chair Jerome Powell said earlier this month that the central bank still has “some ways to go” in its battle to tame inflation, sentiment is clearly growing that the Fed may be able to tap the brakes ever so slightly.
Fed funds futures are now pricing in a nearly 80% chance of a half-point increase, at the Fed’s December policymaking meeting, smaller than the three-quarters of a percentage point increases the Fed announced at the previous four meetings.
“Today’s CPI report shows inflation is moving in the right direction,” said Eric Merlis, managing director and co-head of global markets at Citizens. “The report provides ammunition for the Fed to begin pricing in sub-75-basis-point tightenings. This will be a welcome development for the Fed.”
Peak inflation?
On a monthly basis, prices rose by 0.4%. That’s on par with the previous month’s increase of 0.4%. Economists were anticipating the monthly figure to grow, given energy prices marched upward in October amid a move by OPEC+ to slash oil production and ongoing uncertainty in Russia’s war in Ukraine.
There also appeared to be some gains made in a measurement watched even more closely by the Fed: Core CPI, which excludes the more volatile categories of food and energy, measured 6.3% for the year ended in October, down from the 6.6% increase posted in September.
Month-on-month, core CPI increased 0.3%. It had logged monthly increases of 0.6% in both August and September.
How does inflation affect my standard of living?
This period of high inflation is likely reaching an inflection point, said Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM.
“While I expect the Fed to lift the policy rate by 50 basis points at its December meeting, the supersize rate hikes are likely now in the rearview mirror,” he said.
Thursday’s CPI report marked an improvement from a stretch of hotter-than-expected inflation readings, but the pervasiveness of price increases remains problematic for consumers, businesses and the Biden administration.
“Any meaningful relief for household budgets is still somewhere over the horizon,” said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate.
“In categories that are necessities — shelter, food, and energy — we continue to see large and consistent increases,” he said. “The areas posting declines are for the most part either irregular or more discretionary in nature — airfare, used cars, and apparel.”
Year over year, shelter prices are up 6.9%, food prices are up 10.9%, and energy prices are up 17.6%, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Costs for staples such as eggs (up 43%), bread (up 14.8%) and milk (up 14.%) remain elevated.
—CNN Business’ Matt Egan and Paul R. La Monica contributed to this report.

Record-breaking sale of Microsoft co-founder's art collection surpasses $1.6 billion
Updated 10th November 2022
Credit: Christie's
Written by
Jacqui Palumbo, CNN
Oscar Holland, CNN
This article has been updated following the conclusion of the auction's second part.
Art from the private collection of late Microsoft co-founder Paul G. Allen fetched over $1.6 billion this week to become the largest single-owner sale in auction history.
Works by Georges Seurat, Paul Cézanne, Vincent van Gogh, Paul Gauguin and Gustav Klimt all sold for over $100 million across a record-shattering two nights at Christie's in New York.
Spanning 500 years of art history, art from Allen's collection was offered on Wednesday and Thursday, with all proceeds going to philanthropic causes, the auction house said. Christie's had initially estimated that the 150-plus works would sell for a combined $1 billion, but the landmark sum was exceeded even before the conclusion of day one.
Art explained: How do art auctions really work?
Works by contemporary artists Jasper Johns and Lucian Freud were also among the record-breakers on Wednesday, which saw sales in excess of 1.5 billion. Paintings by Edward Hopper, Georgia O'Keeffe and Jackson Pollock were among dozens more that went under the hammer on day two to add a further $115.9 million to the total.
The auction's single biggest sale was Seurat's ""Les Poseuses, Ensemble (Petite version),"" pictured above, which fetched over $149.2 million — almost five times the previous record for the French artist's work.
Cézanne's ""La Montagne Sainte-Victoire"" attracted the sale's second biggest sale price, fetching almost $137.8 million. Credit: Christie's
Elsewhere, Cézanne's oil on canvas ""La Montagne Sainte-Victoire,"" one of more than 30 views he painted of the French mountain range, sold for almost $137.8 million. Allen acquired the famed alpine scene in 2001 for $35 million, then the second-highest price paid for a Cézanne at auction, according to Max Carter, a vice chairman of 20th and 21st century art at Christie's.
Only five of the painter's views of Sainte-Victoire are left in private hands, Carter added. ""Each one is from a slightly different vantage point. Most of them are slightly further back,"" he told CNN in an interview prior to the sale. ""It's also rare that it's... not obscured by any trees in front of the mountain.""
""Verger avec cyprès"" is now the most expensive Van Gogh painting ever to sell at auction. Credit: Christie's
A Van Gogh painting, ""Verger avec cyprès,"" meanwhile fetched almost $117.2 million to become the most expensive work by the artist ever to sell at auction. Painted in Arles, France, two years before the artist's death, it is ""as special as any Van Gogh we've offered in 30 years,"" according to Carter.
""This is when his color has become unmoored from reality and is dictated by imagination,"" Carter said. Out of the orchard series, ""only five are in private hands,"" he added. ""The vast majority are in museums.""
The two other artworks to attract nine-figure bids were Gauguin's ""Maternité II,"" which fetched $105.7 million, and Klimt's ""Birch Forest,"" a large-scale landscape that sold for over $104.5 million.

Showing a dappled wood scene on the outskirts of Vienna, and painted in Klimt's romantic Art Nouveau style, the latter artwork is ""almost like a fairy tale,"" Carter said. The sale set a new auction record for the Austrian artist a decade and a half after it was part of a landmark sale that included five Klimt masterpieces once looted by Nazis.
The man on the phone: What's it like making history's highest auction bid?
The Gauguin painting also smashed a previous auction record for the artist's work (though one sold at a private sale in 2015 reportedly sold upwards of $300 million). Allen bought the canvas, which has religious overtones in its mother-and-child composition, in 2004 for a then-record $39 million.
It was painted during Gauguin's 10-year stint in French Polynesia, a period of his life that is rife with controversy (he fathered a child with a teenager there) but that produced paintings that are still highly sought-after.
""Most of the paintings or drawings that come up (for sale) tend to be from earlier periods in his life,"" Carter said.

Contemporary masters
After spending several decades assembling his collection, Allen lent works to museums around the world, including The National Gallery and Royal Academy of Arts in London and The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.
The exhibition ""Seeing Nature,"" based on his collection, toured the US in 2016 and 2017 with stops at the Seattle Museum of Art and Minneapolis Institute of Arts, among others. Allen died in 2018 from non-Hodgkin's lymphoma at age 65.
Art explained: How do you fall in love with art?
""(Allen) was collecting all the way up until the year that he passed away,"" Johanna Flaum, a vice chairman of 20th and 21st century art at Christie's, told CNN ahead of the sale.
While most of Wednesday's biggest sellers date back to the 19th century, contemporary masterpieces also attracted record-breaking sums.
A 1980s work by British painter Lucian Freud, ""Large Interior, W11 (after Watteau),"" sold for $86 million, shattering the artist's previous record of $56.2 million. Allen acquired the painting in 1998 for $5.8 million, around 15 years after Freud completed it.

The painting, which has been widely exhibited around the world, took two years for Freud to complete. It was modeled after the figures in French artist Jean-Antoine Watteau's ""Les Jaloux (The Jealous Ones)"" from the early 18th century. But Freud populated his swirling interior scene with his own loved ones.
""(It) has largely been regarded, since the time it was painted, as being Freud's very best painting,"" Flaum said.
Rare portrait by Francis Bacon fetches $52.8 million at auction
""The painting includes a compilation of those that were the closest to Freud: a current lover, ex-lover, (his) children,"" she explained. ""His world is encapsulated in the figures, so it's quite personal.""
Elsewhere, a total of six works by Jasper Johns, the prolific American artist who mounted a two-city retrospective in New York and Philadelphia last year, were offered for sale across the two nights. On Wednesday ""Small False Start"" sold for over $55.3 million.

As well as setting an auction record for the 92-year-old painter, it is now among the most expensive works by a living artist ever to go under the hammer.
Why Jasper Johns has been 'miscast' as a mysterious artist
""One of the interesting things about the Johns market is that there really has been very little to come to auction by way of significant works,"" Flaum said. ""There certainly have been very significant prices that have traded privately... The auction market particularly has really been starved for top quality work by Johns.""
The diversity of works in Allen's collection extended not only to different time periods but also varied media. Sculptures by Alberto Giacometti and Louise Bourgeois also featured across the two-day sale, alongside a hanging mobile by Alexander Calder, an earthenware ceramic vase by Pablo Picasso and a neon sign by American artist Bruce Nauman.

""It's hard to say there's one unifying principle for a collection that spans 500 years of the greatest works of Western art,"" Carter said. ""But I think, to an extent, you can — he was looking at artists who looked at the world a different way, and who were... looking ahead to the future.""
Allen's sister, Jody Allen, said in a press statement ahead of the sale that, to her brother, art was ""both analytical and emotional.""
""He believed that art expressed a unique view of reality — combining the artist's inner state and inner eye — in a way that can inspire us all,"" she said. ""His collection reflects the diversity of his interests, with their own mystique and beauty.""

The US-China climate deal was a rare bright spot in an otherwise thorny relationship. Should it be mended?
By Ella Nilsen, CNN
Updated 8:43 AM EST, Thu November 10, 2022

 — 
One of the biggest surprises at last year’s United Nations climate summit came in the form of a handshake.
US climate envoy John Kerry and his China counterpart Xie Zhenhua did so at COP26 in Glasgow as they announced a commitment to cooperate on the climate crisis. The countries vowed to work together to reduce their fossil fuel emissions, and China pledged to release a plan to slash its emissions of methane – a powerful planet-warming gas – which it delivered on this week.
The terms of the agreement weren’t terribly specific, and it didn’t come with many measurable action points. But the deal was still widely applauded as a step in the right direction in an otherwise discontented geopolitical relationship.
It didn’t last long.
The newfound cooperation abruptly fell apart in August when China suspended climate talks with the US – one of several measures it took in response to US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s trip to Taiwan.
Kerry announces -- and is immediately criticized for -- a new plan to raise money for climate action
The question now is whether COP27 in Egypt can provide the jolt of momentum needed to mend the countries’ climate change relationship. Kerry told CNN on Thursday that he has been having informal conservations with Xie this week but that “we are not formally negotiating at this point.”
“Our hope is that within a short span of time, it will become possible for us to really get together again in full measure and do the things we need to be doing as the two leading emitters in the world and as the two largest economies in the world,” Kerry said.
Before the summit, Kerry told reporters that the ultimate decision to resume formal talks rests with China President Xi Jinping. Biden and Xi are expected to meet at the upcoming G20 summit in Indonesia.
“That will come from one person, and until then we are in limbo,” Kerry said of Xi.
There are many reasons, as Kerry notes, that the two countries should be in sync on the climate crisis. Not only are they historically the most to blame for climate change, their actions also have significant sway in the rest of the world, which look to the US and China to lead on the issue.
Yet, now that cooperation is ostensibly at a standstill, some experts are weighing whether it is necessary; could competition lead to faster change?
A race to the top

Going into Egypt, one big thing is different from last year – the US has actually passed a massive climate law.
Democrats’ Inflation Reduction Act contained $370 billion in clean energy and climate funding and included tax credits for electric vehicles and batteries written in a way to compete with China.
But China had a head start in the clean-energy race and has spent the last decade cruising ahead on wind and solar. Last year, China installed 80% of the world’s new offshore wind capacity, dwarfing the rest of the world’s nations, according to the Global Wind Energy Council. It is also surging ahead on electric vehicles and buses; about a quarter of all new passenger cars registered in China are electric.
Biden moves one step closer to making giant Pacific Ocean wind turbines a reality
The US has a lot of catching up to do, but it’s “back in the race,” said Kelly Sims Gallagher, a professor of energy and environmental policy at the Fletcher School at Tufts University.
“I believe a healthy competition between the two countries will benefit everyone,” she said. “This new money is going to be a really important global injection into clean energy technology and innovation, and it’s likely to catalyze even more (development) in China. But in many respects, China currently has a first-mover advantage; there’s a lot of work for the US to do.”
In China, the US climate bill is being viewed as a “competitive gesture,” and with a certain amount of skepticism that the US can move as fast as it wants to on the clean energy transition, according to Li Shuo, a Beijing-based global policy adviser for Greenpeace East Asia.
“Part of this sentiment is sour grapes, but I think part of it is based on cool-headed analysis – if you are a country who manages to ramp up renewable energy from zero to huge in 10 years, you know the secret to success better than anyone else,” Shuo said.
Chinese officials “are not convinced the US is capable of replicating it,” Shuo said. “Only the US can prove itself and the stakes – our climate future – are high.”
The case for cooperation

The US and China – due to the sheer scale of their planet-warming emissions, money and political heft – have historically been the power players at international climate summits. It’s no different this year, with all eyes on the two countries and whether they’ll resume collaboration.
Kerry told CNN on Thursday that US-China cooperation is essential as the world tries to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.
“China and the US really need to cooperate on this,” Kerry said, noting that it would be impossible to keep warming to 1.5 degrees without the country. “If we don’t have China, nobody else can make it to that goal.”
And there has been a flicker of positive news at COP27.
Xie announced Tuesday at COP27 that his country has developed a national strategy to reduce its methane emissions, fulfilling the promise it made at last year’s summit as it pledged to cooperate with the US.
Speaking at a panel event in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, Xie said China’s methane strategy will focus on three areas: reducing methane from its energy sector, agriculture and waste management areas.
The world needs India to avert climate catastrophe. Can Modi deliver?
However, within the energy sector, Xie only mentioned reducing emissions from oil and gas – and didn’t mention China’s coal sector, which produces much of the country’s methane emissions in addition to CO2 emissions. China produces the most methane emissions from coal mines in the world, according to the US Environmental Protection Agency.
Xie’s announcement is the latest evidence that cooperation between the world’s two largest emitters matters – even more so because of the peer-pressure effect it can have on other countries.
“We have seen times where [US-China cooperation] is producing good results; a positive force in both the domestic context of each country, and also a boost to the international discussions,” said Nate Hultman, director of the University of Maryland’s Center for Global Sustainability, and a former Kerry official. “In that context, the suspension of the talks is a hindrance.”
The end of the US-China agreement triggered an information void as the lines of communication shut down – something that could breed mistrust, according to Sims Gallagher.
This has quickly become the key issue at COP27 -- and the most difficult to resolve
“I’m sure China knows we passed the (Inflation Reduction Act),” Sims Gallagher said. “At a high level that’s understood. But at the granular level, it’s much harder to understand what’s happening and why it’s happening.”
A senior administration official conceded they think something has been lost due to the suspended talks, killing the momentum that came out of the US and China’s joint declaration at Glasgow last year. That official said it is still an open question whether cooperation can continue this year.
Ultimately, it is in China’s best interest, and the world’s, to resume talks with the United States, said Joanna Lewis, associate professor of energy and environment at Georgetown University, because it elevates China’s stature going into a key international summit – allowing a country that is often cast as the climate villain some positive spin.
“When the Chinese lead negotiator and the US lead negotiator get up before the world together, it calls China out as a leader and puts them on a new level of climate leadership,” Lewis said. “Particularly during an international negotiation where they’re not always viewed as taking a leadership role.”

Senate control could hinge on two states with prominent election deniers

 — 
Control of the US Senate could hinge on Nevada and Arizona, two states where GOP victories could elevate some of the most prominent election deniers in the country even after other nominees who had amplified former President Donald Trump’s falsehoods about the 2020 election were rejected by voters in Tuesday’s midterm elections.
Those two western states – perpetual battlegrounds in presidential years – were still too early to call as of early Thursday morning, while a third Democratic-held seat, Georgia, will advance to a December runoff, CNN projects. Republicans need to pick off two Democratic seats to win the majority. As ballots continue to be counted across the country, Republicans appear to be slowly inching toward the 218 seats that would deliver them a House majority, albeit one that’s much narrower than they’d hoped.
Hold on. This election is not yet over
The struggle for the Senate, however, is still full of unknowns – including whether it will all come down once again to Georgia after the Peach State delivered Democrats the majority in 2021 with victories in twin runoffs. It’s Nevada and Arizona that will determine how pivotal Georgia becomes.
Arizona Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly was maintaining an edge over Republican Blake Masters as of early Thursday morning, while Nevada Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto was trailing Republican Adam Laxalt. CNN had estimated late Wednesday that about 600,000 votes remained to be counted across the Grand Canyon State and about 160,000 votes remained to be counted in Nevada.
Laxalt, Nevada’s former attorney general, was a co-chairman of Trump’s 2020 presidential campaign in the state and filed lawsuits attempting to overturn Nevada’s results in that election, which he said was “rigged.” Cortez Masto had argued that the lies and election conspiracies theories embraced by Trump and allies like Laxalt led to the attack on the US Capitol on January 6, 2021.
Masters, a venture capitalist and first-time candidate, released a campaign video as he was competing for the GOP nomination in which he said he believed Trump had won the 2020 election. Masters, like Laxalt, clinched Trump’s endorsement.
After winning the Arizona Senate primary, Masters briefly appeared to back away from some of that extreme rhetoric – scrubbing his website, for example, of language that included the false claim that the election was stolen. In a debate with Kelly, he also conceded that he had not seen evidence of fraud that would have changed the outcome of the election. But the Republican nominee seemed to reverse course after receiving a phone call from Trump urging him to “go stronger” on election denialism, a conversation that was captured in a Fox documentary.
Election deniers up and down the ticket
In addition to Laxalt and Masters, Arizona GOP gubernatorial nominee Kari Lake and the Republican nominees for secretary of state in both states – Arizona state Rep. Mark Finchem and former Nevada state Assemblyman Jim Marchant – have been some of the highest profile promoters of Trump’s falsehoods about the 2020 presidential election.
Lake and Democrat Katie Hobbs, the Arizona secretary of state who rebuffed Republican efforts to overturn the 2020 election in the state, were nearly deadlocked as of early Thursday. Finchem was trailing Democrat Adrian Fontes in the Arizona secretary of state race, while Marchant was slightly ahead of Democrat Cisco Aguilar in the Nevada secretary of state race.
Five baseless 2022 election conspiracy theories, fact-checked
Lake, who falsely insisted the 2020 election was rigged and stolen, refused to commit in a mid-October CNN interview to accepting the results of the 2022 election. “I’m going to win the election, and I will accept that result,” she told CNN’s Dana Bash. Later that month, she told ABC News’ Jonathan Karl that she would accept the results of a “fair, honest and transparent election.”
Although there is no evidence of widespread voter fraud, Marchant had said his top priority was to “overhaul the fraudulent election system in Nevada,” and he has said he would not have certified President Joe Biden’s 2020 victory if he had been secretary of state back then. Biden won Nevada by more than 33,000 votes.
Finchem continues to contend that the 2020 votes in several key Arizona counties should be set aside and he co-sponsored legislation with fellow Republican state lawmakers that would allow them to reject election results.
The prospect of having those Republicans in charge for the 2024 presidential election has put many Democrats on edge, particularly as Trump has teased another run for the White House.
National figures from Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney, the Republican vice chair of the House select committee investigating the January 6 attack, to former Democratic President Barack Obama warned Arizona voters that the future of democracy could be at stake in 2024 if they elected Lake, Masters and Finchem.
A secure election despite efforts by some in the GOP to raise questions
Lake has quickly extended her tactic of sowing doubt about the election results to her current race against Hobbs. On Tuesday night, Lake suggested there was “incompetency” at play in both the August primary and in Tuesday’s election – a critique of her opponent’s oversight over elections.
Also on Tuesday, the right-wing media seized on tabulator problems in Maricopa County, the site of repeated partisan “audits” of ballots in 2020, to raise the idea of fraud – despite assurances to the contrary from county officials. Pointing to the issues in Arizona, Trump falsely alleged on his social media account that “they are trying to steal the election with bad Machines and DELAY.”
A glitch in Maricopa, a gift to election deniers
Some counting in Maricopa County had been delayed because ballots could not be read at some polling places Tuesday, but the ballots were deposited in secure boxes to be counted later, officials said.
Maricopa County Board of Supervisors Chairman Bill Gates refuted Lake’s charge that officials had shown “incompetence” during the 2022 election in an interview with CNN’s Wolf Blitzer on Wednesday. He noted that while there were problems with voting tabulators at about 20% of voting locations in Maricopa County on Tuesday, those problems were resolved by the afternoon.
“I do not believe that what happened yesterday can fairly be called incompetence or corruption in any way,” Gates said. “If people have instances or proof of fraud, we want to hear that,” he added. “But up to this point, we have not. And right now, we are laser focused on getting through this count and doing it in an accurate way.”
He noted in a statement later Wednesday that the board planned to “get to the bottom” of the printer issue that had prevented some of the ballots from being read.
Federal officials said Wednesday that they have not seen any evidence that any voting system used in some 8,800 jurisdictions across the country had been compromised.
“We have seen no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes, or was any way compromised in any race in the country,” US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Director Jen Easterly said in a statement. Easterly urged Americans to be patient “as election officials continue to do their jobs and carry out the certification process.”
Vote counting in Arizona and Nevada could span days
Election officials in both Arizona and Nevada have advised that many ballots remain to be counted.
As of Wednesday, there were still some 400,000 ballots to be counted in Maricopa County, the most populous county in Arizona. Gates said he expects 95% of the votes in the county to be counted by Friday evening.
Officials in Pima County, Arizona, said they have about 159,000 ballots to be counted and don’t expect to complete their count until November 14 or 15, CNN’s Bob Ortega reported Wednesday night. Pima County, where Tucson is located, is the state’s second most-populous county.
Officials in Clark County, Nevada, which is that state’s most populous county, said they will be counting and updating ballot results through next week.
Election officials in Clark County said they have collected about 56,900 mail ballot that were dropped at drop boxes at Election Day polling places, CNN’s Gary Tuchman reported on Wednesday night. The state will continue to accept mail-in ballots through Saturday as long as they were postmarked by November 8.
The state also has a process for “curing ballots” – allowing voters who turned in ballots with a mistake or something missing – to rectify those issues by November 14.

Arizona's Maricopa County expects to start releasing results from outstanding mail-in ballots Friday

Arizona's Maricopa County expects to start releasing Friday evening the first results from its outstanding 290,000 mail-in ballots that voters dropped off on Election Day, a top official told CNN late Thursday.
""We should start to see those tomorrow, I believe – we’ll start seeing those come in,"" said Bill Gates, chairman of the Maricopa County board of supervisors.
Maricopa is Arizona's most populous county and it includes the city of Phoenix.
The mail-in ballots dropped off were a record for the county, Gates said. “It’s a lot of ballots that people are trying to process, but we’re going to get through it. We’re going to do it on a timeline that’s frankly consistent with how long it takes us to get this done every two and every four years.”
Gates pushed back on criticism from Arizona’s Republican gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake, who has been questioning the integrity of the elections and the length of time to get results. 
“There’s nothing out of the ordinary; it makes me wonder if Kari Lake has really been following elections in the past in Maricopa County,” he said.
On Thursday, Maricopa County staff verified nearly all of the 290,000 early ballots dropped off on Election Day. It updated an additional tranche of just over 78,000 ballots on Thursday night. 
The estimated ballots remaining, according to the county, include:
17,000 Election Day ballots to be reported
68,928 early ballots left to process and tabulate
29,153 early ballots left to verify
2,878 provisional ballots left to research out of 7,885 total

Voters in 4 states approve efforts to wipe slavery and indentured servitude off the books
From CNN's Shawna Mizelle and Sonnet Swire
Voters in five states on Tuesday were asked whether to update their states’ constitutions to remove slavery and indentured servitude as potential punishments. In four of the five states, voters agreed to strike the punishment from the books, CNN projects, while the effort fell short in one.
Although the 13th Amendment to the US Constitution prohibited slavery in 1865, it allowed an exception “for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted,” and the proposed amendments asked voters to either explicitly rule out slavery and indentured servitude as potential punishments or remove the terms from state law altogether. 
Voters in Alabama, Oregon, Tennessee and Vermont approved ballot measures to amend their state's constitutions accordingly. However, Louisiana voters rejected an amendment that would have changed the state’s constitution by explicitly prohibiting the punishments, CNN projects.

Ted Cruz joins Herschel Walker for first campaign event of Senate runoff
From CNN's Nick Valencia and Devon M. Sayers
(CNN)
At the first runoff campaign event, Republican Senate candidate Herschel Walker was joined by Sen. Ted Cruz with both men boldly predicting a GOP win in the runoff election. 
Addressing a crowd of hundreds of supporters in Canton, Georgia, Walker said, “We are in overtime. We got a runoff. I was built for this. God prepared me for this moment right here.” 
Canton, about an hour outside the City of Atlanta, is located in Cherokee County, a deeply red part of the state. 
A source close to the campaign told CNN that hosting the event in Canton was part of Walker’s runoff campaign strategy to perform better in Republican counties where they underperformed on Election Day compared to incumbent Republican Gov. Brian Kemp, who avoided a runoff. 
During his address to supporters, Walker continued to attack his rival, Sen. Raphael Warnock, and President Joe Biden, telling a crowd of supporters that the two are in lockstep. Walker went so far as to warn the crowd not to fall for Warnock’s clean-cut image, calling Warnock a “wolf in sheep’s clothing.” 
Meanwhile, Cruz went on the offensive, enthusiastically addressing the crowd saying, “I am here to tell you: On December 6th Herschel Walker is winning this race.“ 
Cruz rallied the crowd with references to immigration, inflation and grievances against the media in his 15-minute speech. 
He boldly predicted the GOP would flip the Senate, claiming that there is no bigger divide between a senator and his constituents than in Georgia, referring to Warnock. 
“The eyes of the country are upon you. The odds are high that control of the Senate will be decided by the men and women of Georgia,“ Cruz said.
When asked by CNN after the event if Cruz thought Walker should call on former President Donald Trump to visit Georgia to stump with Walker, Cruz said:
“Herschel has made clear he will welcome the support from President Trump who’s supporting him. He said he would welcome the support of Ron DeSantis. He will welcome the support of anyone coming to campaign.""

Former Rep. Ryan Zinke, who left his seat for a scandal-plagued tenure as President Donald Trump’s Interior secretary, will defeat Democrat Monica Tranel to win Montana’s 1st Congressional District, CNN projects.
Zinke, a former Navy SEAL and Montana state senator who was first elected to the House in 2014 and reelected in 2016 before resigning to join Trump’s Cabinet, seized on an opening created when the 2020 census results handed the Treasure State a second congressional district.
Republicans have 211 of the 218 seats needed to control the House, according to CNN projections. The Democrats have 195.

Democrats jockeying for position as they await Speaker Pelosi's decision on House leadership
From CNN's Manu Raju

House Democrats are eagerly awaiting word from Speaker Nancy Pelosi about whether she will continue to run the caucus she has dominated for the past two decades as they decide whether to run for the top job.
Pelosi is widely expected to announce her decision once it is clear which party will have the majority in the House and after she returns from her trip to a climate conference in Egypt.
That could come as soon as next week when the House returns to session, with members meeting Monday evening for the first time since the election and the full caucus on Tuesday. The leadership elections are scheduled for Nov. 30.
If she steps aside, as most members believe she will, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries is seen as the front-runner for the top position, though he could face a challenge from Rep. Adam Schiff and others.
But all eyes are also on the two Democrats currently below Pelosi: Steny Hoyer and Jim Clyburn. Hoyer has long coveted the top position, but with many in the caucus calling for generational change and diversity in the ranks, the 83-year-old Hoyer could have a difficult time winning the votes.
""I've told all the younger members, I'll be out of here by 2036,"" Hoyer told reporters when asked about his next moves. He indicated he would wait for the House to be called before announcing his next steps.
Clyburn has recently signaled he wouldn't block Jeffries' ascension to the top spot, but he might want to stay in leadership, which could prevent other Democrats from ascending. Rep. Katherine Clark is seen as the frontrunner for the No. 2 job, depending on what Hoyer and Clyburn do.

T. rex skull could sell for $20 million at auction
Published 10th November 2022
Credit: Sotheby's
Written by
Amarachi Orie, CNN
A Tyrannosaurus rex skull is expected to fetch up to $20 million at auction next month, according to Sotheby's.
The skull, which has been named Maximus, is one of the most complete of its kind ever found, the auction house said in a press release Tuesday, adding that it represents a ""rare and important paleontological discovery.""
Weighing over 200 pounds and standing 6 feet and 7.5 inches (2 meters) tall, the colossal skull could become one of the most valuable fossils sold at auction when it is offered at a sale in New York.
The skull, named Maximus, is one of the most complete of its kind ever found, according to Sotheby's. Credit: Sotheby's
Describing the fossil as ""extremely rare,"" the auction house's global head of science and popular culture, Cassandra Hatton, said in a statement that the sale was an ""unprecedented moment.""
Mummified dinosaur's skin was gnashed by ancient crocs
Maximus was discovered on private land in the extensively studied Hell Creek Formation in South Dakota. The skull belonged to an adult dinosaur, and all its ""tooth-bearing jaw elements"" have been preserved along with most of its external bones. The rest of the skeleton was largely destroyed by erosion, as the excavation site had been severely weathered over time, the auction house said.

""This T. rex fossil is an extraordinary discovery,"" said Henry Galiano, a Sotheby's natural history consultant, in a press statement. ""Unearthed in one of the most concentrated areas for T. rex remains, the skull retained much of its original shape and surface characteristics with even the smallest and most delicate bones intact, with an extremely high degree of scientific integrity.
""Without the work of experienced field palaeontologists who carefully collected and preserved this skull, it may have eroded away and been lost to science forever,"" he added.
Fossil auction controversy
Last month marked 25 years since a T. rex nicknamed Sue became the first dinosaur ever to be auctioned, which sold the fossil for $8.36 million. Described by Hutton as ""the largest and most complete T. rex ever discovered,"" Sue was also found at the Hell Creek Formation, which has yielded more T. rex remains than any other location in the world, according to Sotheby's.
In 1997, a T. rex nicknamed Sue became the first dinosaur ever to sell auction, said Sotheby's. Credit: Martin Baumgaertner/Field Museum
The 1997 sale was met with controversy, however, with some experts concerned that specimens in private collections would become unavailable for scientific study. Paleontologists have also argued that the growth of the collectors' market makes it harder for them to carry out excavation work on private land.
Scientists are concerned about the million dollar auction of this dinosaur skeleton
""In many areas where dinosaur fossils are found, it is becoming more difficult for professional paleontologists to obtain permission to collect fossils on private property because of the commercial value of fossils,"" wrote paleontologist John W. Hoganson in a 1998 edition of the North Dakota Geological Survey's newsletter.
It is a debate that has surrounded large fossil auctions ever since. Earlier this year, Sotheby's sold the skeleton of a Gorgosaurus, a relative of the T. rex, for just over $6 million, prompting fresh concerns among experts. It was the only fossil of its kind ever to be offered for private ownership, with the other known specimens all housed in museum collections.
""In my own opinion, there are only cons,"" P. David Polly, a professor and chair of the department of earth and atmospheric sciences at Indiana University Bloomington, told CNN at the time of the Gorgosaurus sale. ""While certainly there is no law in the US that supports this for fossils that come off private land, it's easy for me as a scientist to argue that that fossil is important to all of us, and really ought to be going into a public repository where it can be studied — where the public at large can learn from it and enjoy it.""

Voters approve Medicaid expansion and a minimum wage increase in these states
By Tami Luhby, CNN

'Not the normal midterm election': David Axelrod reacts to voting night trends
02:26 - Source: CNN
CNN
 — 
Voters in several states have approved progressive measures that could not get through a Democratic-led Congress or Republican-dominated statehouses.
More low-income South Dakota residents will have access to Medicaid, and Arizona residents with medical debt will get more protections. Minimum wage workers in Nebraska will get a boost in pay.
Here’s a sampling of the ballot measures:
South Dakota will expand Medicaid in 2023
South Dakota voters voted to broaden Medicaid to roughly 42,500 low-income residents starting in mid-2023. The measure passed 56% to 44%, according to South Dakota Secretary of State data.
“South Dakotans know their families and neighbors deserve health care without going into debt or avoiding check-ups, procedures, and medication they need,” said Kelly Hall, executive director of The Fairness Project, which backed the measure.
It’s the seventh successful effort to expand Medicaid in Republican-led states, which began with the approval of Maine voters in 2017. Ballot initiatives have also passed in Missouri, Oklahoma, Idaho, Nebraska and Utah in recent years.
More than 60 organizations – including the South Dakota Farmers Union, the Greater Sioux Falls Chamber of Commerce and multiple health care and religious groups – endorsed Amendment D. It will open up coverage to adults making less than roughly $19,000 a year.
Currently, childless adults are not eligible for Medicaid in South Dakota, and parents must have very low incomes to qualify – about $1,000 a month for a family of four.
Obamacare is proving popular in red states that didn't expand Medicaid
By expanding Medicaid, South Dakota is expected to receive an additional $328 million in federal funds the first year and generate 4,000 new jobs, according to Zach Marcus, campaign manager for South Dakotans Decide Healthcare, which advocated for the ballot measure. The state’s Legislative Research Council found last year that expansion would save South Dakota $162.5 million over five years.
Many Republican officials opposed the measure, citing its potential future costs. States are responsible for picking up 10% of the health care tab of the expansion enrollees.
South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, a Republican, did not support the initiative, though she has said she will carry it out if voters approve it. An expansion bill failed in a state Senate vote earlier this year.
Until the vote, South Dakota was one of 12 states that had opted not to expand Medicaid. The only remaining states where citizen-led ballot initiatives could be possible are Florida and Wyoming, Hall said.
The minimum wage will rise in Nebraska
Nebraska voters opted to raise the state’s minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2026, up from the current $9 an hour. The vote was 58% to 42% in favor, according to Nebraska Secretary of State data.
It is expected to benefit about 150,000 workers, according to the National Employment Law Project and the Economic Policy Institute, which are both left-leaning groups. Some 75% of the workers are over the age of 20.
The measure will provide these workers with an additional $2,100 in pay, said Kate Wolfe, campaign manager of Raise the Wage Nebraska. More than 25 organizations and lawmakers are in the coalition that supported Initiative 433, which was backed by The Fairness Project.
“Initiative 433 passed tonight because Nebraskans understand that raising the minimum wage is about respecting and rewarding hard work,” Wolfe said.
Voters in 2014 approved a ballot measure to raise the minimum wage to $9 an hour by 2016.
Opponents, however, said that the initiative would hurt businesses in the state and reduce employment opportunities for youth.
“The proposed increase in the initiative is a 66.7% increase over four years,” Bud Synhorst, CEO of the Lincoln Independent Business Association, wrote in a local business publication last month. “That is a radical increase that will be felt across the economy.”
In Nevada, some 54% of voters had cast ballots supporting a state constitutional amendment to increase the minimum wage to $12 an hour by 2024, as of Wednesday afternoon, according to Nevada Secretary of State data. The measure would also remove an existing provision setting different rates for the minimum wage based on whether the employer offers certain health benefits.
Some 46% of voters were opposed to the measure, as of Wednesday evening.
CNN projected on Friday that the amendment will pass.
The state minimum wage is already set to rise to $12 an hour for workers who don’t receive certain health care benefits and $11 an hour for those who do, in 2024.
Supporters of the initiative, Question 2 on the ballot, said that workers should have a constitutional guarantee of a $12 hourly minimum wage, preventing lawmakers from reducing it in the future. Opponents argued the change wasn’t necessary because the state legislature already has the authority to increase the minimum wage.
Medical debt measures approved in Arizona
Voters in Arizona overwhelmingly opted to change some rules governing medical debt owed by residents.
Proposition 209 passed by a 72% to 28% vote, according to Arizona Secretary of State data. It will cap the interest rate on medical debt at 3% and limit wage garnishment for medical debt to a maximum of 30% of earnings.
It will also increase the value of primary residences and cars that would be protected from medical debt collectors to $400,000 and $15,000, respectively, up from $250,000 and $6,000, said Rodd McLeod, spokesperson for Healthcare Rising Arizona, which supported the measure that is also backed by The Fairness Project.
The measure will not forgive any medical debt, McLeod said.
Opponents argued the initiative would hurt consumers. It will make it harder for Arizonans to obtain credit and for businesses in the state to collect on debt, as well as increase interest rates on consumer debt, according to Protect Our Arizona, which had hoped to defeat the measure.
California may not tax the rich
Meanwhile, California’s Proposition 30, which would add a surtax of 1.75% on people making more than $2 million a year, was on its way to failure, 59% to 41%, as of Wednesday evening, according to California Secretary of State data. CNN is not yet projecting a winner.
Most of the funds would have gone to promote zero-emission vehicles and wildfire prevention and control.
The measure was backed largely by Lyft, which, like other ride-share companies, is subject to another state rule requiring that it use mostly zero-emission vehicles by 2030. Opponents, including the state Republican Party, said the ballot measure was an attempt by Lyft to get taxpayers to foot the bill for the company.
Notably, Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom also opposed the measure, appearing in an ad to defeat it.
“Prop 30 is being advertised as a climate initiative, but in reality it was devised by a single corporation to funnel state income taxes to benefit their company,” he said in the ad.
Supporters, which include environmental groups, public interest organizations, unions and a bevy of Democratic officials, said the measure was needed to address climate change in the state. It would generate roughly $100 billion over the next 20-plus years, they said.

Putin will not attend G20 summit in person, Russian embassy says
By Mayumi Maruyama and Nectar Gan, CNN
Updated 12:44 AM EST, Fri November 11, 2022

 — 
Russian President Vladimir Putin will not attend in person a summit of leaders from the Group of 20 nations in Bali next week, the Russian embassy in Indonesia told CNN on Thursday.
Putin will be represented by Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, said Yulia Tomskaya, the chief of protocol at the embassy.
Tomskaya added that Putin is still deciding if he will join one of the meetings virtually.
Indonesia’s Coordinating Minister for Maritime Affairs and Investment, Luhut Binsar Pandjaitan, also said that Putin would not attend. Pandjaitan, who is helping to coordinate the summit, said the Russian President would be represented by “senior officials.”
Putin’s decision not to attend the G20 summit in person saves him the embarrassment of being confronted – or shunned – by other world leaders over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The meeting will take place just days after the Kremlin announced Russian forces would retreat from a large swathe of Kherson – one of four Ukrainian regions Putin previously said Russia planned to annex in violation of international law.
Russia's withdrawal from half of Kherson is both humiliating and unsurprising
In the lead up to the event, Western countries and Ukraine have pressured Indonesia, the G20 host, to step up its condemnation of Moscow and withdraw its invitation to Putin for the summit. Since invading Ukraine in late February, western democracies have treated Russia and Putin as a pariah on the world stage.
US President Joe Biden, who is attending the summit, said in March Russia should be ejected from the G20, a multilateral organization comprised of 19 of the world’s major economies and the European Union. Senior members of Biden’s administration have walked out of G20 events where Russian delegates are present.
When asked if he would meet Putin one-on-one in Bali during an exclusive interview last month, Biden said he did not see a good reason to do so but it would “depend on specifically what he wanted to talk about.” Biden said if Putin wanted to discuss the jailed American basketball star Brittney Griner then he would be open to talking.
Jakarta has resisted pressure to single out Russia and has sought to remain a neutral position. It has invited Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to the summit as a guest.
Zelensky has said that Ukraine would not take part in the G20 summit if Putin attends. The Ukrainian President is expected to join the meetings virtually.
China’s leader is attending
Chinese leader Xi Jinping, who met Putin in Uzbekistan in September, is also expected to attend the summit and meet Biden for the first time since the American President took office nearly two years ago.
Beijing has not officially confirmed whether Xi will attend the summit or meet with Biden. But on Wednesday, Biden told a news conference at the White House following the midterm elections that he will be having talks with Xi in Bali.
Biden said he’s not planning to make any “fundamental concessions” and that they will discuss the economy and trade. But he declined to reveal what his message would be on US military support to Taiwan should China move on the self-governing island.
“I’m gonna have that conversation with him,” Biden added, noting that they’ll lay out “what each of our red lines are.”
Their much-anticipated meeting comes as relations between US and China hit their lowest point in decades in a downward spiral that started under the former presidency of Donald Trump, as the two countries ramp up their rivalry in trade, technology, geopolitics and ideology.
In recent months, tensions have reached new highs following US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan and the Biden administration’s ban on the sale of advanced chips and chip-making equipment to China.
Meanwhile, under Xi, China has moved closer to Russia, united by their plummeting relations with the US and other Western countries. Weeks before the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Xi and Putin declared their countries share a “no-limits” friendship. Beijing has since refused to condemn the war in Ukraine, or refer to it as an “invasion.”
After G20, Xi will attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Bangkok, which kicks off next Friday, according to Thailand’s Foreign Ministry. Biden is not expected to attend the event, while Putin has yet to confirm his attendance.

 — 
At least two people have died during the damage wrought by Nicole’s overnight landfall Thursday along Florida’s eastern shore, which knocked out power to thousands, pushed buildings near collapse and flooded the coast as the first hurricane to hit the United States in November in nearly 40 years.
Two people were “electrocuted by a downed power line” in Orange County, the Orange County Sheriff’s Office said in a press release.
A tornado threat, plus powerful wind and heavy rain, are expected to continue Thursday in parts of Florida, Georgia and South Carolina after Nicole, which hit at Category 1 strength, weakened to a tropical depression. All tropical storm and storm surge warnings have however been discontinued.

Meanwhile, communities are assessing the damage.
At least 49 beachfront buildings including 24 hotels and condos have been deemed “unsafe” following Hurricane Nicole in Volusia County, officials said in a press release. “The structural damage along our coastline is unprecedented,” county manager George Recktenwald said in the release. “We have never experienced anything like this before, so we ask for your patience as we make our assessments.
An additional 11 structures on Daytona Beach shores have already been deemed compromised, according to Recktenwald.
Volusia County officials have “declared a curfew in incorporated and unincorporated areas east of the Intracoastal Waterway from 11:22 a.m. Thursday, Nov. 10, through 7 a.m. Friday, Nov. 11,” said a Volusia County storm update.
Two hundred residents were housed in county shelters, said the update. Three shelters remain open. Roughly 23,000 customers are without power in the county, according to PowerOutage.us.

In Indian River County, officials Thursday morning will “be assessing debris and messaging cleanup plans,” said spokesperson Kathy Copeland. In St. Lucie County, there were so far “no serious reports of damages or injuries,” spokesperson Erick Gill said, adding, “Most likely the biggest impact is going to be beach erosion.”

At 10 p.m. ET Thursday, Nicole was packing 35-mph sustained winds and centered about 20 miles north of Tallahassee, moving northwest at 15 mph.
Up to 8 inches of rain could drench eastern, central and northern portions of Florida through Saturday. And between 2 to 6 inches are expected from parts of the US southeast to the southern and central Appalachians and western mid-Atlantic, the hurricane center said.
Nicole weakened to a tropical storm shortly after landfall, and then became a depression late Thursday. It’s expected to become a post-tropical cyclone over the Southeast.
Here’s what to know now:
Residents outside Florida should now prepare: There are nearly three million people under a tornado watch issued for southeast Georgia, eastern and southern South Carolina and portions of far southern North Carolina. “Given the uncertainty of the storm’s strength and path as it approaches South Carolina, residents need to have their personal emergency plans ready to go just in case we need to take safety precautions later in the week,” said Kim Stenson, who heads the state’s emergency management division.
Tens of thousands without power: More than 237,000 homes and businesses in Florida were without power late Thursday, according to PowerOutage.us.
Low tide limits storm surge: Nicole’s peak winds coincided with low tide, limiting the storm surge and inundation on the shore. At Port Canaveral, the surge was measured at just under 6 feet around 4 a.m. ET, just after landfall. Later Thursday morning, surge was down to around 3 feet, but water levels are expected to remain high through high tide, between 8 a.m. and 10 a.m.
Nicole's storm surge pushes Wednesday into East Boynton Beach in Florida.

King Tide puts structures at risk: The King Tide that affected Volusia County Thursday morning “is of great concern for potentially further damage to structures,” said officials with Volusia County Emergency Management. King Tides is a term used to describe higher than normal tidal cycles that typically occur during a new moon or a full moon when the moon makes its closest pass to the Earth. When they coincide with bad weather including heavy rain, winds and waves, they can cause severe flooding. Because of rising sea levels, King Tides are becoming more frequent and severe.
Flights canceled and schools closed: The storm’s colossal path led to the closure of many schools, colleges and universities, as well as the cancellation of hundreds of flights and the shuttering of amusement parks. Orlando International Airport halted operations Wednesday afternoon, and Miami International Airport warned of cancellations but did not plan to close.
Historic hurricane: Nicole’s landfall Thursday was the latest in a calendar year a hurricane has ever struck Florida’s Atlantic coast. It broke the record set by the Yankee Hurricane, which hit Florida’s east coast on November 4, 1935.
Where the storm hit: The storm struck just south of Vero Beach with winds of 75 mph before quickly weakening, the National Hurricane Center said. Its strong winds, downpours and storm surge thrashed some areas hit in September by Hurricane Ian. Nicole on Wednesday brought strong winds and dangerous storm surge to the northwestern Bahamas.

Paul Pelosi’s alleged attacker indicted by federal grand jury
By Holmes Lybrand and Sonnet Swire, CNN
Updated 11:32 PM EST, Wed November 9, 2022
CNN has obtained the driver's license photograph of David DePape, the man suspected of attacking Paul Pelosi at his San Francisco home.

 — 
A grand jury has returned a federal indictment charging David DePape, the man accused of violently attacking House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s husband in late October, with attempted kidnapping of a federal official and assault of an immediate family member of a federal official.
“If convicted, he faces a maximum sentence of 30 years in prison for the assault count and 20 years in prison for the attempted kidnapping count,” the Justice Department said in a statement Wednesday.
With the indictment, DePape is facing both federal and state charges, which include “attempted murder, residential burglary, assault with a deadly weapon, elder abuse, false imprisonment of an elder, as well as threats to a public official and their family,” according to San Francisco district attorney Brooke Jenkins.
DePape has already pleaded not guilty to all state charges during his initial appearance in San Francisco court, and he waived his right to a hearing within 10 days at his arraignment. He waived his appearance in court last week, where a status hearing was set for November 28 and a preliminary hearing was set for December 14.
Depape is currently being held without bail.
Jenkins has said that based on DePape’s statements, it appears the attack was “politically motivated.”
“Yes, it appears as though this was, based on his statements and comments that were made in that house during his encounter with Mr. Pelosi, that this was politically motivated,” she said.
The speaker’s husband, Paul, was attacked with a hammer at the couple’s home in San Francisco, and disturbing details have emerged about the incident, including that the alleged assailant told police he was on a “suicide mission” and had a list of other prominent targets.
DePape, according to court documents, told police he planned to hold Nancy Pelosi hostage, calling her the “leader of the pack of lies” promoted by the Democrats.
Following the attack, Paul Pelosi had surgery “to repair a skull fracture and serious injuries to his right arm and hands,” Drew Hammill, a spokesman for Nancy Pelosi, said in an earlier statement.
He has since been released from the hospital.
“Paul remains under doctors’ care as he continues to progress on a long recovery process and convalescence,” Nancy Pelosi said after her husband’s hospital discharge. “He is now home surrounded by his family who request privacy.”

 — 
Twitter appears to be battling a wave of celebrity and corporate impersonators on its platform who have quickly gamed the company’s new paid verification system, hours after its launch.
CNN has confirmed multiple verified Twitter accounts have been suspended by the platform after other users posted screenshots showing misleading content from the accounts. The fake verified accounts had posed as former President Donald Trump, Rudy Giuliani, Nintendo of America, the basketball player LeBron James, the software company Valve and others.
Before being suspended, the impostor Nintendo account tweeted an image of the video game character Mario giving the viewer the middle finger. The LeBron James account falsely claimed the athlete had requested a trade. The fake Trump account tweeted, “This is why Elon Musk’s plan doesn’t work.”
Multiple Twitter users on Wednesday reported having easily created verified impostor accounts, though CNN was unable to independently confirm their responsibility in all cases.
CNN did speak to the user behind the fake Trump account, Brian Whelan, whose Twitter bio and LinkedIn identify him as head of video and social at London-based Times Radio.
Biden says Elon Musk's relationship with other countries 'worthy of being looked at'
On Twitter, Whelan claimed he created a fake Trump account “within two beers” and after spending £6, and tweeted a screenshot of the fake account attempting — but failing — to follow former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton after the fake account had been suspended.
In an interview with CNN, Whelan said he managed to impersonate Trump by repurposing an old, spare account. He purchased Twitter Blue for the old account using a prepaid card tied to his real name, and “immediately [had] a fake Trump with a blue tick for two hours.”
Rachel Tobac, a cybersecurity expert, noted the trend and said it could quickly spread to bad actors impersonating first responders or other government accounts.
“This verification roll out is causing huge trust issues across the platform already,” Tobac tweeted.
New Twitter owner Elon Musk has said the feature is aimed at raising spammers’ costs, and that accounts abusing the new verification system to impersonate others would be permanently banned, despite his earlier promises that such bans would be “extremely rare” under his ownership of the platform.
The wave of impersonations comes as Twitter enabled the ability for any user to purchase a blue check mark for their profiles without providing identity verification — a feature that information security experts warned would lead to widespread fakes and deceptive behavior.
Musk argued during a Twitter Spaces event with advertisers Wednesday that even wealthy bad actors such as state-sponsored disinformation agents would eventually be deterred because they may run out of credit card and phone numbers.
Asked by CNN to respond to that claim, Chris Krebs, the former director of the US government’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, tweeted a GIF from the cartoon “Futurama” showing the character Fry narrowing his eyes in skepticism.

Female governors will break a record in 2023
By Simone Pathe, CNN
Published 9:33 PM EST, Wed November 9, 2022

 — 
The US will have a record number of female governors in 2023. Still, the record-setting number – 12 – will represent a small fraction of the top executives across the 50 states.
The previous record of nine female governors serving concurrently was set in 2004, according to the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University.
Incumbent female governors in Maine, Alabama, Michigan, Iowa, South Dakota, Kansas and New Mexico won reelection on Tuesday, while New York Gov. Kathy Hochul won a first full term after taking over the top job in 2021 following the resignation of Andrew Cuomo. Hochul will become the first elected female governor in the state.
Meet the history-makers of the 2022 midterm elections
Two states – Massachusetts and Arkansas – elected new female governors. Democrat Maura Healey will become the first woman elected to the governorship of Massachusetts and the first out lesbian governor in the US. Republican Sarah Huckabee Sanders, a former White House press secretary in the Trump administration, will become the state’s first female governor, winning the job that her father once held.
Arkansas and Massachusetts will also become the first states to have women serving in the governor and lieutenant governor positions at the same time, according to CAWP.
CNN has yet to make a projection in two gubernatorial races – Arizona and Oregon – in which all the candidates are women. Those states are included in the record-setting 12.
Democrat Katie Hobbs, the Arizona secretary of state, was narrowly leading Republican Kari Lake, a favorite of former President Donald Trump, in the Grand Canyon State, as of Wednesday evening.
And in Oregon, Democrat Tina Kotek, a former state House speaker, was marginally ahead of Republican Christine Drazan, a former state House minority leader, while former state Sen. Betsy Johnson, an independent, was pulling less than 10% of the vote, as of Wednesday evening. Kotek could also become one of the first out lesbian governors in the country.
Even before Election Day, 2022 had set a record for the number of all-female gubernatorial matchups. Those five states were Arizona, Alabama, Iowa, Michigan and Oregon. Before this year, there had only been four woman-versus-woman gubernatorial matchups in all of history, according to CAWP. In total, 25 women were nominated for governor by the two major parties in 2022, a historical record. Sixteen of them were Democrats and nine were Republicans.
Of the gubernatorial races that CNN has projected so far, Democrats have won six and Republicans have won four.

'We are in trouble here in Daytona': Coastal homes collapse into the ocean01:00
November 10, 2022 Hurricane Nicole news
By Amir Vera, Jason Hanna, Christina Walker, Nouran Salahieh and Travis Caldwell, CNN
Updated 1:45 a.m. ET, November 11, 2022
What we covered here
Nicole, after making landfall as a Category 1 hurricane just south of Florida's Vero Beach early Thursday, is now a tropical storm hitting the state with heavy rains and widespread, strong winds.
Nicole is expected to downgrade to a depression Thursday night, according to the National Hurricane Center.
At least two deaths -- electrocutions in Orange County -- are attributed to Nicole, officials say.
Some beachside homes have collapsed in Florida's Volusia County, in part because storm surge has further deteriorated coastlines previously battered by Hurricane Ian. Nicole also has caused coastal and river flooding, including in Jacksonville.

Category 1 Hurricane Nicole makes landfall in Florida

Hurricane Nicole has made landfall on Florida’s Atlantic coast just south of Vero Beach as a Category 1 hurricane early Thursday morning, according to the National Hurricane Center, sending rising ocean water onshore and lashing the state with damaging winds and heavy rainfall.
The hurricane -- packing maximum sustained winds of up to 75 mph -- has arrived in the Sunshine State as some cities are still recovering from Hurricane Ian, which hit Florida as a Category 4 storm just weeks ago.
Nicole is the first hurricane to make landfall in the US in November in nearly 40 years. The last hurricane to do so was Hurricane Kate in 1985.
The storm system should weaken to a depression early Friday and become a post-tropical cyclone over the Southeast.

""We don't want to end up like Surfside."" Volusia County authorities evacuate structurally unsound buildings ahead of Nicole’s landfall
From CNN's Nouran Salahieh
Volusia County Sheriff Mike Chitwood speaks during an interview in Daytona Beach Shores, Florida, on November 9. (WESH)
Ahead of Hurricane Nicole's arrival, deputies went door to door Wednesday evacuating residents from structurally unsound buildings in Volusia County.
""There is a strong potential that one or more buildings will collapse during the storm,"" Volusia County Sheriff Mike Chitwood told CNN affiliate WESH.
The sheriff said the buildings had suffered structural damage during Hurricane Ian, which hit Florida as a catastrophic Category 4 storm just weeks ago.
Early storm surge from Nicole eroded the seawall, making it imperative to evacuate residents, Chitwood told WESH.
""We don't want to end up like Surfside,"" the sheriff added.
In Surfside, Florida, part of Champlain Towers South crumbled to the ground last year, killing 98 people. Its collapse was not storm-related.
In Daytona Beach Shores, 12 buildings were declared structurally unsafe Wednesday, according to the sheriff. In the unincorporated area Wilbur-by-the-Sea, 22 single homes were deemed unsafe and evacuated.
""This isn't just a summer residence for somebody or a second home. For a lot of folks, this is their retirement home and everything that they've saved to live here, live on the oceanfront, can potentially be collapsing,"" Chitwood said.

NHC: Hurricane Nicole only miles off Florida shore
From CNN's Nouran Salahieh and Robert Shackelford
Hurricane Nicole is expected to soon make landfall along Florida's east coast, packing sustained maximum winds of 75 mph.
The large storm is about 15 miles east of Fort Pierce, Florida, churning towards the state at 14 mph, according to the National Hurricane Center.
Heavy rains, strong winds, dangerous storm surge and waves are already being reported as Nicole nears the coast.
NOAA buoy 41009, located about 25 miles east of Cape Canaveral, recently reported a sustained wind of 49 mph and a wind gust of 65 mph. A weather station at Patrick Air Force Base recently reported a sustained wind of 53 mph with a wind gust of 61 mph.
A NOAA tide gauge at Fernandina Beach, at Florida's northeast corner, observed a water level of 4.5 feet above Mean Higher High Water.
1:43 a.m. ET, November 10, 2022
Hurricane terminology to know
From CNN Weather
Here are some hurricane terms to familiarize yourself with:
Eye: The center of the storm and also the calmest part of the storm, where you can see a blue sky during the day and stars at night. An eye usually develops when the storm's maximum sustained wind speeds are above 74 mph.
Eye wall: This is the most dangerous part of the storm. It's a ring of tall thunderstorms that produce the strongest winds and heavy rains.
Hurricane-force winds: Hurricane-force winds weaken the farther you move away from the eye. In just a few miles you can drop a whole category.
Tropical storm-force winds: Tropical storm-force winds usually are felt throughout a large swath of a hurricane. But they don’t stretch as far as the outer edge of the clouds. These winds are still dangerous but are not the worst of the storm.
Outer bands: These are bands that spiral out of the storm like a pinwheel with water on it. These lines of storms are where tornadoes typically form. It is also where flooding can occur. The bands can create a “training” effect where it just continues to rain in the same place, like we saw in Houston for days after Harvey.

With Hurricane Nicole expected to make landfall along Florida's east coast Thursday morning, strong winds are already being reported in the state.
A near hurricane-force wind gust of 73 mph was reported at 12:55 a.m. at Playalinda Beach on the east coast, just north of Cape Canaveral.
Port Canaveral recorded a wind gust of 67 mph, Sebastian Inlet reported a 66 mph gust and Melbourne recorded a 58 mph gust late Wednesday night.
Nicole has measured maximum sustained winds of 75 mph, with higher gusts. Hurricane-force winds are expected to extend outward up to 25 miles from the center, according to the National Hurricane Center.

Where things stand with Hurricane Nicole as it approaches Florida's east coast
From CNN's Amir Vera and Gene Norman
(CNN Weather)
After wreaking havoc in northwestern Bahamas Wednesday, Hurricane Nicole is poised to make landfall along the east coast of Florida in the next couple of hours, according to an update from the National Hurricane Center.
The storm is about 30 miles east-southeast of Fort Pierce Beach, Florida, moving west-northwest at 14 mph, the center said early Thursday. Nicole has maximum sustained winds of 75 mph.
Little change in strength is expected until Nicole makes landfall, according to the Hurricane Center.
""Nicole's center is then expected to move across central and northern Florida into southern Georgia Thursday and Thursday night, and into the Carolinas Friday,"" the hurricane center said.
The storm is expected to weaken as it moves across Florida into the southeastern US, and is ""likely to become a post-tropical cyclone by Friday afternoon,"" the center said.
NHC notes that Nicole will bring “strong winds, dangerous storm surge and heavy rains and that large intense bands extend quite far from the center.""
The Hurricane Center has warned that threats from the large storm stretch beyond its forecast cone.
“Do not focus on the exact track of Nicole since it is a large storm with hazards extending well to the north of the center, outside the forecast cone,” the Hurricane Center warned.
“These hazards will affect much of the Florida peninsula and portions of the southeast US.”
Strong winds are already being reported in the state, with Port Canaveral recording a wind gust of 67 mph, a 66 mph gust at Sebastian Inlet and Melbourne recording a 58 mph gust late Wednesday night.
Wind and storm surge from the storm has already led officials to deem buildings unsafe or at the risk of collapse. Universities and amusement parks have also closed operations in preparation for Nicole's landfall. Airlines canceled thousands of flights to prepare as well.
Tornadoes are also possible as Nicole approaches.
Because an area of convection within the outer bands of Nicole’s northwest side is increasing, there’s an increased threat for isolated, brief tornadoes forming, according to the Storm Prediction Center.
To prepare for Nicole, Gov. Ron DeSantis expanded his state of emergency -- originally for 34 counties -- to include 11 additional counties.
12:37 a.m. ET, November 10, 2022
Tornado potential increasing overnight as Hurricane Nicole makes final approach to Florida’s east coast
From CNN's Derek Van Dam
Authorities are urging individuals to have multiple ways to receive weather warnings as they go to bed as the threat of tornadoes increases overnight.
Intense rain-bands will move across the east coast of Florida overnight as Hurricane Nicole moves onshore. Embedded within these bands of rain may be quick forming tornadoes, often lasting only a few minutes but strong enough to create damage and threaten lives.
By Thursday morning, the threat extends inland towards the I-301 corridor as the system slides across the Florida Peninsula.
Tropical induced tornadoes are common with landfalling hurricanes as the rain-bands interact with the immediate coastline. The right, front quadrant of the tropical system is where the most likely tornado activity occurs.
12:36 a.m. ET, November 10, 2022
Fort Lauderdale’s barrier island continues to flood due to the storm surge
From CNN’s Joe Sutton
(CNN Weather)
As Hurricane Nicole inches closer to Florida’s east coast, authorities in Fort Lauderdale say the storm surge is flooding its barrier island, making many roadways impassable. 
“The barrier island continues to flood due to the storm surge from the south end to the north end of the city. Traffic operations are impacted and many roadways are impassable,"" Fort Lauderdale Police said Wednesday evening on Twitter.
The National Hurricane center has issued several storm surge watches and warnings as Nicole churned toward the state, pushing rising sea water inland from the coastline.
""Attempting to drive during the storm is dangerous and should be avoided,” Fort Lauderdale Police said.
A high tide was expected around 9 p.m. ET, and flooding has already occurred across the area, city of Fort Lauderdale officials said.
12:23 a.m. ET, November 10, 2022
Volusia County officials deem 22 single homes unsafe
From CNN's Denise Royal and Leyla Santiago
As Hurricane Nicole approaches, upcoming high tides and coastal erosion are a big concern in Volusia County, according to Kevin Captain, Volusia spokesperson. 
Volusia County officials deemed 22 single homes unsafe in the unincorporated area Wilbur-by-the-Sea. All of the homes were evacuated.
""Those buildings that were deemed unsafe are directly correlated to some of the coastal erosion that we've experienced,"" Captain said Wednesday evening, acknowledging that Hurricane Ian left the coast vulnerable when it struck six weeks ago. 
 ""It [Hurricane Ian] hammered our coast. It took away our buffer, meaning all of that sand that we had as a protective layer, we lost,"" he said. ""So when you remove that buffer and now you (add) another storm on top of that, it's a problem and recipe for disaster.""
Captain said about 60 individuals were in county shelters. 
He urged people to stay off the beach, referencing a tourist who died during Hurricane Ian when she went outside, fell and drowned on the beach. 
Volusia County officials expect the damage assessment to begin later on Thursday.

 — 
Adidas (ADDDF) ended its sneaker partnership with Ye, formerly known as Kanye West, last month after the musician’s anti-Semitic tirade. But Adidas (ADDDF) will continue to sell the lucrative sneaker and apparel line, stripped of the Yeezy name and branding.
The company said it’s the sole owner of all Yeezy line design rights for both existing and future colors and versions. Selling the sneakers under Adidas’ own branding will save the company about $300 million in royalty payments and marketing fees.
“Going forward, we will leverage the existing inventory with the exact plans being developed as we speak,” Adidas finance chief said Wednesday Harm Ohlmeyer.
The Yeezy line was a key product for Adidas and the fallout has hurt the company.
Yeezy products generated nearly $2 billion in sales last year for Adidas accounting for 8% of the company’s total sales, according to Morgan Stanley. The line also helped Adidas get shelf space at major retailers and brought new customers into the stores who purchased other Adidas merchandise.
Ending the partnership cost Adidas more than $250 million in profit and $500 million in lost revenue, the company said Wednesday.
On Tuesday, Adidas said it was appointing a new CEO, tapping the head of Puma to succeed outgoing CEO Kasper Rorsted.
Norwegian Bjørn Gulden, 57, will become CEO of Adidas next year. He will have to find ways to replace Yeezy sales and turn around the brand. Adidas’ stock has dropped around 80% the last two years.
It would be a mistake for Adidas to continue selling the line, said Darcey Jupp, an apparel analyst at GlobalData.
“It should refrain from relaunching items under its own brand, as they will always be synonymous with West, and this would likely result in muted customer demand,” he said in a note to clients.

 — 
Between warnings of a recession, high inflation and layoff fears, the news is bleak. Why not have some chocolate?
Chocolate makers are reporting booming sales as stressed out customers reach for something sweet to take the edge off.
In the third quarter, sales of Hershey’s (HSY) chocolates, which include Reese’s, Kit Kat and Hershey bars, jumped 12.6% in retail. Mondelez (MDLZ), the global snack brand that makes Toblerone, Cadbury and others, said its chocolate sales grew 9.3% in the quarter.
Chocolate, like many comfort foods, got a boost during the pandemic. But unlike other categories such as pizza, where interest fell off as employees returned to the office and kids went back to school, chocolate is still growing — thanks in part to demand from stressed out consumers.
“Chocolate grew in 2020 and has maintained that growth, something many industries were not able to do,” according to a 2022 report from the research firm Mintel. “Increased at-home occasions, the need for fun and relief from stress, and the availability and convenience of chocolate all contributed to this upward trajectory.”
In the year through October 30, chocolate sales hit $17.7 billion in US retail, according to data from market research firm IRI, up from $14.6 billion for the year in 2019.

One reason for the growth is higher prices for groceries and snacks, including chocolate. The increase isn’t affecting sales too much — shoppers are not that sensitive to changes in the price of chocolate, said Dan Sadler, principal of client insights at IRI, who has expertise in the confections market and tracks price sensitivity.
In the second quarter, IRI found that elasticity for chocolate was about -.4. That means that a 10% increase in prices would result in only a 4% drop in sales by volume, Sadler explained.
“You can raise that price, and you’ll see a little bit of a hit to volume, but not a whole lot, not like you will in some other categories,” he said.
How America turned into a nation of snackers
Even chocolate makers have been surprised by how well demand is holding up.
Elasticity “remains below expectations,” said Mondelez CEO Dirk Van de Put during a recent analyst call discussing the company’s third-quarter results, lower even than before Covid. “We see consumers saying that chocolate is really something they cannot live without.”
Hershey raised its net sales and earnings outlook for the year on November 4th, when it reported third-quarter results that exceeded its expectations.
“Our products remain an affordable treat for families and for consumers,” said Hershey CEO Michele Buck during an analyst call. “We know that part of that is they want to reward themselves when times are tough. They also use these products to relieve stress. And we think that those trends will continue.”
Customers are making some changes, she noted, like shopping at value channels or choosing value packs.
It’s not s’mores without Hershey
Companies like Mondelez and Hershey are largely spared competition from store brands, or private label, which are gaining ground as grocery prices rise.
According to IRI, just 2.7% of the US chocolate retail market is made up of private label, while that portion is much higher in other categories. In dairy milk, for example, store brands account for about 62% of sales. Even in salty snacks and non-chocolate candy, private label share is at 4.8%.
Shoppers are “brand specific” when it comes to chocolate, Sadler said. “You’re gonna make s’mores with a Hershey bar, you’re not going to substitute with something else.”
Mondelez benefits from that kind of brand loyalty, as well. “Shoppers continue to say they are much less likely to switch to private label in chocolate and biscuits compared to other categories,” said Mondelez’s Van de Put during the call.
Eventually, higher prices may hit the chocolate category. IRI is seeing volume sales start to dip, Sadler noted, suggesting that consumers are becoming more price sensitive.
And though private label sales pale in comparison to national brands, they are also growing at a faster clip than branded chocolate.
IRI’s data shows that private label sales rose 16% in the year through October 30 compared to the year before, while national brands grew by 8.8%.
Still, chocolate isn’t going anywhere. The sweet’s “position as an accessible indulgence will help shield it from significant impacts,” Mintel’s report said.

Changes are coming for Wordle … again.
For starters the New York Times (NYT) this week named Tracy Bennett the new editor of Wordle, the wildly popular online puzzle game that gives players six chances to guess a five-letter word daily.
With an editor in place, the Times said that the game is shifting away from the preselected words of Josh Wardle, the puzzle’s creator. It will, instead, include words that the New York Times has chosen.
Also changing: The answer will never be a plural that ends in “s” or “es.” However, you can guess plural words to help you eliminate possible words.
“Wordle’s gameplay will stay the same, and answers will be drawn from the same basic dictionary of answer words, with some editorial adjustments to ensure that the game stays focused on vocabulary that’s fun, accessible, lively and varied,” Everdeen Mason, the Times’ editorial director of games, said on Monday.
Wordle and your brain: Does playing make you smarter?
Mason added that “while the answer list is curated, the much larger dictionary of English words that are valid guesses will not be curated. What solvers choose to use as guess words is their private choice.”
The Times bought Wordle for “low seven figures” earlier this year. It’s a part of the Times’ portfolio of online games that includes the Crossword and Spelling Bee.
Wordle, which was turned into a board game in July, has been a huge success for the news company, helping boost the number of digital subscriptions for the newspaper.
“Wordle brought an unprecedented tens of millions of new users to the Times, many of whom stayed to play other games which drove our best quarter ever for net subscriber additions to Games,” said CEO Meredith Kopit Levien in the earnings release from May.

New Webb telescope image shows ‘lonely’ dwarf galaxy in striking detail

CNN
 — 
The James Webb Space Telescope has snapped a remarkably detailed image of a nearby dwarf galaxy. The near-infrared view reveals the deepest glimpse yet into a stellar panorama that could offer astronomers an ideal means of studying aspects of the early universe.
The image shows a panoply of stars within a lonely dwarf galaxy called Wolf - Lundmark - Melotte, which lies about 3 million light-years from our home galaxy, the Milky Way, and is about one-tenth the size.
Ghostly figures emerge from Pillars of Creation in new Webb telescope image
The WLM galaxy is intriguing to astronomers because it has remained largely isolated and bears a similar chemical makeup to galaxies in the early universe, according to NASA.
The Webb telescope, which launched in December 2021, is the most powerful space observatory to date. It’s capable of detecting the faint light of incredibly distant galaxies as they glow in infrared light, a wavelength invisible to the human eye.
The Hubble Space Telescope and the now-defunct Spitzer Space Telescope have imaged the WLM galaxy, but Webb used its Near-Infrared Camera, also called NIRCam, to capture it in unprecedented detail.
“We can see a myriad of individual stars of different colors, sizes, temperatures, ages, and stages of evolution; interesting clouds of nebular gas within the galaxy; foreground stars with Webb’s diffraction spikes; and background galaxies with neat features like tidal tails,” said Kristen McQuinn, an assistant professor in the department of physics and astronomy at Rutgers University in Piscataway, New Jersey, in a comment posted on NASA’s website. A tidal tail is a thin “tail” of stars and interstellar gas extending off a galaxy.
“It’s really a gorgeous image,” added McQuinn, who is one of the lead scientists on the Webb Early Release Science program.
On Twitter, NASA’s official Webb telescope account declared that, compared with past space observatory images, Webb’s NIRCam image “makes the whole place shimmer” — a reference to the song “Bejeweled” on Taylor Swift’s new album, “Midnights.”
Some of the stars pictured in this latest Webb image are low-mass stars that were formed in the early universe and are able to survive for billions of years, McQuinn noted on NASA’s site.
“By determining the properties of these low-mass stars (like their ages), we can gain insight into what was happening in the very distant past,” she said.

University of Kentucky student who repeatedly hurled racist slur at Black student permanently banned from campus

 — 
The student facing assault charges after she repeatedly hurled a racial slur at a Black student on campus early Sunday morning has been permanently banned from campus and could face additional charges, the University of Kentucky president said.
Sophia Rosing – who is no longer a student – was initially suspended on an interim basis, and is now no longer a student, permanently banned from campus, and will not be eligible to re-enroll as a student, the message from University of Kentucky (UK) President Eli Capilouto to the UK community said.
Black University of Kentucky student in viral video says she was 'physically, verbally and racially assaulted'
“Although she is no longer a student, we must continue our investigations,” Capilouto continued.
“That includes our cooperation with an investigation into criminal charges filed; our Code of Student Conduct disciplinary proceedings and racial harassment misconduct being reviewed by our Office of Institutional Equity and Equal Opportunity.”
“As a community working wholeheartedly to prevent racist violence, we also must be committed to holding people accountable for their actions. The processes we have in place are essential,” he continued.
On Tuesday, Rosing’s attorney, Fred Peters, told CNN that she plans to withdraw from UK in the next couple of days and that she is “very embarrassed, very remorseful, very humiliated.”
Rosing has been charged with alcohol intoxication in a public place, fourth-degree assault without visible injury, second-degree disorderly conduct, and third-degree assault on a police officer or probation officer, according to Kimberly Baird, the Fayette County Commonwealth’s Attorney.

Gun hidden in a raw chicken found at Florida TSA checkpoint

(CNN) — A gun found inside a raw chicken at an airport security checkpoint has the TSA calling ""personal fowl.""
""The plot chickens,"" the Transportation Security Administration posted this week on Instagram after someone at the agency put on their punny pants and called attention to the ""baste of time"" that is stuffing a bird with a firearm.
The passenger was headed to Port-au-Prince, Haiti, according to Sari Koshetz, a TSA spokesperson for the Gulf region.
Nestor Iglesias, a spokesperson for Homeland Security Investigations, the investigative arm of the US Department of Homeland Security, said he could not offer additional details because it is an ""ongoing criminal case which has been accepted for prosecution.""
A record number of guns have arrived at TSA checkpoints in Florida in 2022. Passengers have brought more than 700 guns to checkpoints at airports in the state so far this year -- a year-to-date number that already surpasses any previous year, according to a TSA news release.
Records have been set at 12 Florida airports, with airports in Orlando (129 guns), Fort Lauderdale (120 guns) and Tampa (102 guns) leading the way.
Nearly all of the guns discovered at checkpoints were loaded, the TSA said, and most had ammunition chambered.
""An accidental discharge could result in tragedy,"" the TSA's Koshetz said in a statement. ""Every passenger bares the responsibility of knowing exactly where their gun is before entering the security checkpoint.""
For many passengers, bringing guns to airports resulted in arrests and notices to appear in court.
Civil penalties from the TSA can reach $13,910 even if the passenger is not arrested, the TSA's news release said.
Firearms must be packed in checked luggage. The TSA outlines specific rules related to guns and ammunition on its website.

The owner of Joe’s Service Center in Altadena, California, who came to the United States from Syria in 1980 with $14,000 in his pocket, is now a millionaire after selling the sole winning Powerball lottery ticket.
California Lottery officials presented the check to Joe Chahayed and his sons Joe Jr. and Danny on a rainy election day outside of their gas station.

Chahayed said lottery officials were waiting for him before he opened his shop this morning. “They said, ‘congratulations, your station sent a winner,’” he recounted.
Chahayed hopes the winner is from the neighborhood, and is glad a portion of the lottery money will go towards California schools. “I have 11 grandchildren and I have to share with them,” he said, then thanked the media for coming out in the rain to celebrate the winnings. “I encourage you to buy a ticket from this station. We guarantee you one day you’re going to be winners too,” said Chahayed.
“Somebody is holding on to a very important piece of paper this morning worth $2.04 billion, that’s two billion forty million dollars,” said Carolyn Becker, California Lottery spokesperson. “That person needs to keep it safe. We will not know who they are until they come forward, but we have a second record to talk about today and that’s California lottery raised more money than ever thanks to one growing jackpot for California public schools.” She said this is the first time the California lottery has created a billionaire.
Chahayed came to America 42 years ago with his wife and two children. “I work hard, seven days a week, I raise my kids, graduate from college, I bought a house, and I bought a business all because I work hard and I’m an honest man,” Chahayed boasted.

Deadly listeria outbreak in 6 states linked to deli meat and cheese

 — 
A deadly outbreak of listeria in six states has been linked to contaminated deli meat and cheese, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced Wednesday.
The truth, and strategy, of food expiration dates
People at high risk of severe illness from listeria infection — such as pregnant people, the elderly and those with weakened immune systems — should not eat meat or cheese from any deli counter without first reheating it “steaming hot,” the agency suggests.
A total of 16 people have been infected, and 13 have been hospitalized, according to reports from six states. One death was reported in Maryland; another person became ill while pregnant and lost their baby, the CDC said in a statement.
To date, seven listeria infections has been reported in New York, three in Maryland, two in Illinois, two in Massachusetts, one in California and one in New Jersey. Those infected ranged in age from from 38 to 92, with an average age of 74. Over half of those sickened were men.
Most of the people identified in the outbreak so far are of Eastern European descent or speak Russian, the CDC said, adding that the agency is still investigating reasons for why the outbreak appears to be disproportionately affecting this population.
However, some infected people who got sick could have recovered without medical care, and thus their cases have gone unreported. “The true number of sick people in this outbreak is likely higher than the number reported, and the outbreak may not be limited to the states with known illnesses,” the CDC added.
In interviewing those sickened, CDC investigators found that five of the seven people in New York purchased sliced deli meat or cheese from at least one location of NetCost Market, a chain of stores selling international foods. However, that is not the only location of the illness, the CDC said, as people sickened in other states reported buying meats or cheeses from other delis.
Listeria monocytogenes is a hardy bacteria that can be easily transferred in food preparation and can be hard to remove, the CDC said.
Deli counters and food processing facilities can be a common source of listeria infection, the CDC said, as listeria can easily spread between food and equipment or surfaces and can be hard to remove.
If you have purchased deli cheese or meat, the agency recommends a careful cleaning of your refrigerator — and any containers or surfaces the meat or cheese may have touched — with hot, soapy water.
“Call your healthcare provider right away if you have any symptoms of severe Listeria illness after eating meat or cheese from a deli,” the CDC said.
Symptoms of listeria usually occur within four weeks of infection but can take as long as 70 days to appear. In some cases, the first signs of infection are diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms. Typical symptoms that follow include headache, stiff neck, fever, muscle pain, confusion, loss of balance and convulsions.
Who’s most at risk
Listeria is the third leading cause of death from food poisoning in the United States, according to the CDC, and is especially dangerous for anyone older than age 65, with a weakened immune system, or pregnant.
How do you know if your chicken is cooked properly? It's complicated, say researchers
Pregnant people are especially at risk. According to the CDC, they are 10 times more likely to get a listeria infection, and the odds are even higher for Hispanic pregnant people, who are 24 times more likely to get listeria.
Pregnant people typically experience only flu-like symptoms, but the danger to a developing fetus is high. Infections during pregnancy can lead to miscarriage, premature delivery or stillbirth. Newborns with listeria infection can develop blood infections, meningitis, and other serious and potentially life-threatening complications.
A listeria infection is treated with antibiotics.

US Navy engineer and wife sentenced for conspiring to sell classified information to foreign country

 — 
A US Navy nuclear engineer and his wife have each been sentenced to about two decades behind bars for conspiring to sell classified information related to the design of nuclear-powered warships to a foreign country in exchange for thousands of dollars in cryptocurrency.
The Justice Department announced Wednesday that Jonathan Toebbe, 44, of Annapolis, Maryland, was sentenced to more than 19 years. His wife, Diana Toebbe, 46, was sentenced to more than 21 years in prison.
The couple pleaded guilty in February to conspiracy and hoped to get a federal judge in West Virginia to sign off on proposed plea agreements for lesser sentences. Judge Gina Groh rejected the agreements stating that it was not in the best interest of the country to accept the deals in which Jonathan Toebbe could have been sentenced to between 12 and 18 years in prison, while his wife could have been sentenced to up to three years in prison.
The Toebbes pleaded guilty again in September as part of new agreements that exposed them to longer potential sentences, according to court documents.
The couple coordinated drop-offs of encrypted SD cards containing classified information about nuclear submarines, specifically Virginia-class vessels, for who they believed were members of a foreign government in exchange for thousands of dollars in cryptocurrency, according to a criminal complaint.
Prosecutors said the couple went to great lengths to hide the SD cards at the dead-drop locations over the course of several months, tucking an SD card into a Saran-wrapped peanut butter sandwich in one instance, while others were hidden inside a packet of gum and a sealed Band-Aid wrapper.
“The Toebbes conspired to sell restricted defense information that would place the lives of our men and women in uniform and the security of the United States at risk,” said Assistant Attorney General Matthew Olsen of the Justice Department’s National Security Division.

CNN Business
 — 
Twitter appears to be battling a wave of celebrity and corporate impersonators on its platform who have quickly gamed the company’s new paid verification system, hours after its launch.
CNN has confirmed multiple verified Twitter accounts have been suspended by the platform after other users posted screenshots showing misleading content from the accounts. The fake verified accounts had posed as former President Donald Trump, Rudy Giuliani, Nintendo of America, the basketball player LeBron James, the software company Valve and others.
Before being suspended, the impostor Nintendo account tweeted an image of the video game character Mario giving the viewer the middle finger. The LeBron James account falsely claimed the athlete had requested a trade. The fake Trump account tweeted, “This is why Elon Musk’s plan doesn’t work.”
Multiple Twitter users on Wednesday reported having easily created verified impostor accounts, though CNN was unable to independently confirm their responsibility in all cases.
CNN did speak to the user behind the fake Trump account, Brian Whelan, whose Twitter bio and LinkedIn identify him as head of video and social at London-based Times Radio.
Biden says Elon Musk's relationship with other countries 'worthy of being looked at'
On Twitter, Whelan claimed he created a fake Trump account “within two beers” and after spending £6, and tweeted a screenshot of the fake account attempting — but failing — to follow former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton after the fake account had been suspended.
In an interview with CNN, Whelan said he managed to impersonate Trump by repurposing an old, spare account. He purchased Twitter Blue for the old account using a prepaid card tied to his real name, and “immediately [had] a fake Trump with a blue tick for two hours.”
Rachel Tobac, a cybersecurity expert, noted the trend and said it could quickly spread to bad actors impersonating first responders or other government accounts.
“This verification roll out is causing huge trust issues across the platform already,” Tobac tweeted.
New Twitter owner Elon Musk has said the feature is aimed at raising spammers’ costs, and that accounts abusing the new verification system to impersonate others would be permanently banned, despite his earlier promises that such bans would be “extremely rare” under his ownership of the platform.
The wave of impersonations comes as Twitter enabled the ability for any user to purchase a blue check mark for their profiles without providing identity verification — a feature that information security experts warned would lead to widespread fakes and deceptive behavior.
Musk argued during a Twitter Spaces event with advertisers Wednesday that even wealthy bad actors such as state-sponsored disinformation agents would eventually be deterred because they may run out of credit card and phone numbers.
Asked by CNN to respond to that claim, Chris Krebs, the former director of the US government’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, tweeted a GIF from the cartoon “Futurama” showing the character Fry narrowing his eyes in skepticism.

How the Georgia Senate runoff will work

CNN
 — 
Democrats have clinched 50 seats in the Senate, but the stakes remain high for Georgia’s December 6 runoff between Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock and Republican challenger Herschel Walker.
Neither candidate surpassed the 50% threshold needed to win the race outright in the November general election, forcing a runoff.
But what exactly does that mean? How will the runoff election work? And what would a win or a loss mean for each party?
Here’s what you need to know.
What is a runoff and how does it work?
A runoff is an additional election used to determine the winner of a certain race when neither candidate earns the required threshold for victory – in this case, 50%.
Takeaways from the 2022 midterm elections: Battle for control of the House and Senate still up in the air
In Georgia, runoffs are more straightforward than general elections in that the candidate with the most votes wins.
Georgia’s top elections official, Brad Raffensperger, said counties are already preparing for the December 6 election, and voters can request absentee ballots starting Wednesday through November 28 via the state’s online portal.
Early voting must begin by November 28 in all counties, but Raffensperger said his office anticipates some counties could have early voting on Saturday, November 26 or Sunday, November 27. “We are working with the counties to find out what their plans are on this front,” he said.
Notably, the logistics of the 2022 runoff will be different than in years passed. The 2021 Georgia law that cut the length of runoffs from nine weeks to four means that the deadline for a new voter to register for the runoff election has already passed.
Gabriel Sterling, the chief operating officer for Georgia’s Secretary of State Office, told CNN’s Paula Reid Sunday evening the cutoff is in place because, “Historically, the state constitution of Georgia lays out that the runoff is supposed to be a continuation of the original election.”
“There’s some responsibility on voters in this thing. The reality is if you’re a registered voter in this state, and we have 7.9 million of them, you’re able to vote in this state whether you vote in the election or not,” Sterling said.
What is at stake?
Put simply, a lot.
With Democrats projected to hold 50 Senate seats, voters in Georgia will determine whether the chamber remains split 50-50 – and runs based on a power-sharing agreement that depends on Vice President Kamala Harris breaking tie votes – or whether Democrats gain the 51 seats needed for a true majority.
Top officials from the Democratic and Republican parties told CNN they intend to double down on their significant investments in Georgia, with an increasing assumption that meaningful control of the Senate could hinge on the outcome of the runoff.

CNN's Election Center uses race ratings by Inside Elections with Nathan L. Gonzales, which provides nonpartisan analysis of campaigns for Senate, House and governor.
What are the candidates saying?
In brief remarks on Tuesday night, Walker asked supporters gathered in a hotel ballroom to “hang in there a little bit longer.”

“I’m telling you right now – I didn’t come to lose,” Walker said.
Warnock, meanwhile, told supporters early Wednesday morning, “We’re not sure if this journey is over today, or if there’s still a little work yet to do, but here’s what we do know: We know that when they’re finished counting the votes from today’s election, that we’re going to have received more votes than my opponent.”
Both candidates are expected to speak later Wednesday, aides said, with specific plans still in flux.

The James Webb Space Telescope has snapped a remarkably detailed image of a nearby dwarf galaxy. The near-infrared view reveals the deepest glimpse yet into a stellar panorama that could offer astronomers an ideal means of studying aspects of the early universe.
The image shows a panoply of stars within a lonely dwarf galaxy called Wolf - Lundmark - Melotte, which lies about 3 million light-years from our home galaxy, the Milky Way, and is about one-tenth the size.

The WLM galaxy is intriguing to astronomers because it has remained largely isolated and bears a similar chemical makeup to galaxies in the early universe, according to NASA.
The Webb telescope, which launched in December 2021, is the most powerful space observatory to date. It’s capable of detecting the faint light of incredibly distant galaxies as they glow in infrared light, a wavelength invisible to the human eye.
The Hubble Space Telescope and the now-defunct Spitzer Space Telescope have imaged the WLM galaxy, but Webb used its Near-Infrared Camera, also called NIRCam, to capture it in unprecedented detail.
“We can see a myriad of individual stars of different colors, sizes, temperatures, ages, and stages of evolution; interesting clouds of nebular gas within the galaxy; foreground stars with Webb’s diffraction spikes; and background galaxies with neat features like tidal tails,” said Kristen McQuinn, an assistant professor in the department of physics and astronomy at Rutgers University in Piscataway, New Jersey, in a comment posted on NASA’s website. A tidal tail is a thin “tail” of stars and interstellar gas extending off a galaxy.
“It’s really a gorgeous image,” added McQuinn, who is one of the lead scientists on the Webb Early Release Science program.
On Twitter, NASA’s official Webb telescope account declared that, compared with past space observatory images, Webb’s NIRCam image “makes the whole place shimmer” — a reference to the song “Bejeweled” on Taylor Swift’s new album, “Midnights.”
Some of the stars pictured in this latest Webb image are low-mass stars that were formed in the early universe and are able to survive for billions of years, McQuinn noted on NASA’s site.
“By determining the properties of these low-mass stars (like their ages), we can gain insight into what was happening in the very distant past,” she said.

President Joe Biden said Twitter owner and Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s relationship with other countries was “worthy of being looked at,” but declined to say how that could be done.
“I think that Elon Musk’s cooperation and/or technical relationships with other countries is worthy of being looked at, whether or not he is doing anything inappropriate,” Biden said, when asked if Musk was a threat to national security. “But that’s all I’ll say.”
When a reporter in the room asked, “How?” the President responded: “There’s a lot of ways.”
Twitter stock falls after report says Biden admin weighing security review of Musk ventures
Just before Musk completed his $44-billion acquisition, Bloomberg reported that Biden administration officials were in early discussions about possibly subjecting some of Musk’s ventures to national security reviews, including the Twitter takeover. Asked by CNN at the time, the administration pushed back on the report, which cited people familiar with the matter.
“We do not know of any such conversations,” National Security Council Spokesperson Adrienne Watson said in a statement. A Treasury spokesperson said the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States “does not publicly comment on transactions that it may or may not be reviewing” by law and practice.
Among the equity investors who committed to provide financing to help Musk fund the deal are several foreign entities, including the Qatar sovereign wealth fund and Saudi Arabian Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, who was already one of Twitter’s largest investors prior to Musk’s proposed takeover.

Momentum – and planning – for DeSantis 2024 bid takes off after resounding Florida win
By Steve Contorno, CNN
Updated 9:09 AM EST, Thu November 10, 2022
Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis celebrates at an election night party in Tamp on November 8, 2022, after winning his race for reelection.

Tampa, Florida
CNN
 — 
Amid growing chatter about his political future and in the face of recent outbursts directed his way from an increasingly agitated Donald Trump, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis rarely engaged in the speculation or mudslinging. He insisted a statement victory in his bid for a second term needed to precede any discussion of 2024.
On Tuesday night, that statement came in the form of a 19-point landslide win over Democrat Charlie Crist – the most lopsided victory by a Republican gubernatorial nominee in Florida history and a gap that dwarfed Trump’s own Sunshine State win in 2020. Within minutes of the polls closing, DeSantis’ Tampa election night party burst into euphoria as the totality and breadth of his resounding performance began to crystalize. DeSantis had turned once-solidly blue counties red, won over a majority of Latino voters and carried on his coattails Republican candidates up and down the ballot and in every corner of the state.
Ron DeSantis will win reelection as Florida governor, CNN projects
“We not only won election, we have rewritten the political map,” DeSantis declared to his supporters before confetti rained down on him and his family. Some in the crowd urged him to consider a White House bid by chanting, “Two more years!”
The outcome in Florida was a bright spot for Republicans, who otherwise waited for a red wave that never arrived and watched Trump-backed candidates flounder in key battlegrounds. And the reaction within the GOP has only further fueled momentum for DeSantis to run for president and take on Trump head-on next year.
“DeFuture,” read Wednesday’s front page of the New York Post, owned by conservative media mogul Rupert Murdoch.
Republicans are particularly encouraged by the result in Latino-majority Miami-Dade County, where DeSantis won 55 percent of the vote, because of what it might suggest about the governor’s ability to engage with and message to Latino communities around the country. A GOP gubernatorial candidate hadn’t won the county in two decades. A CNN exit poll showed DeSantis with an 18-point lead over Crist among Florida Latino voters, a reversal from his first campaign for governor four years ago.
Within Florida, DeSantis allies are already huddling about what comes next. Even before Election Day, there was a strong sense among those in his orbit that DeSantis would likely launch a presidential campaign regardless of whether Trump did the same. Multiple sources told CNN that DeSantis in recent months has privately suggested to donors that Trump’s divisiveness is a hindrance to enacting conservative priorities, a marked shift in how the governor has discussed his former ally.
After Tuesday, more Republicans have gone public in suggesting that the former president’s influence is dragging down the GOP. One source close to DeSantis’ political operation told CNN that he expected the governor to make a decision “soon after inauguration” in January, though he may not publicize it.
DeSantis, the source added, “must take action” and capitalize on Trump’s midterms setback.
“There’s no way to deny Donald Trump got fired Tuesday night,” Georgia Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan, a Republican who has been critical of Trump, told “CNN This Morning” on Thursday. “The search committee has brought a few names to the top of the list and Ron DeSantis is one of them. I think Ron DeSantis is being rewarded for a new thought process with Republicans and that solid leadership.”
With competing Florida rallies Sunday, Trump and DeSantis preview a potential GOP presidential primary showdown
Still, the timing of a 2024 campaign launch, if it happens, remains up in the air. When reports first emerged that Trump intended to kickstart his presidential campaign in mid-November, those in DeSantis’ circle braced for the possibility of a quick turnaround from the midterm to a presidential primary showdown. Now, several consultants in Florida say DeSantis likely won’t formally jump into the presidential field until after state lawmakers meet for their annual legislative session. That would put DeSantis on a timeline of a May or June announcement.
“Build anticipation,” one longtime Republican fundraiser with knowledge of DeSantis’ operation said. “I think DeSantis controls the time frame. As much as everyone anticipates things and you want to move quickly, he calls the shots now.”
Even those with access to DeSantis caution that he has not come to a final decision about his future and they say he has maintained a tight circle as he weighs his options. The governor’s brain trust is notoriously small. It consists of himself and his wife, Casey. But sources said the DeSantises also are hyper aware that he has a window to make a 2024 move, and though it widened after Tuesday, it might not stay open forever.
“You have a moment,” one GOP pollster told CNN before Election Day. “Something could come up in a second term that knocks him down.”
The intrigue surrounding a potential Trump-DeSantis showdown reached the White House on Wednesday. Asked which of the two Republican rivals would be the tougher 2024 competitor, President Joe Biden remarked, “It’d be fun watching them take on each other.”
Planning red meat for spring
Multiple sources told CNN that DeSantis will orchestrate a legislative session full of conservative priorities that he can carry into a GOP presidential primary. Republicans won a super majority in both chambers of the Florida legislature Tuesday, allowing DeSantis to make good on promises to further restrict abortion and make it easier to carry a firearm in public.
The legislative session will be “as red meat as you can possibly imagine,” a GOP consultant said. “Whatever he proposes, they will pass it, and it will become law.”
The Republican fundraiser said that “anything ‘woke’ they can find to kill within their path, they’re going to do that” and predicted that financial institutions, in particular, would be a DeSantis target this spring.
In the meantime, DeSantis will continue to build out a political operation that has already proved it can raise money at an impressive clip. His reelection effort brought in more $200 million between his two political committees, according to state campaign finance reports, pulling money in from deep-pocketed donors and grassroots Republicans alike to shatter national fundraising records for a gubernatorial campaign. As of November 3, those committees had $66 million in unspent cash. CNN previously reported that DeSantis’ political team has explored how to transfer the unused money into a federal committee that could support a presidential campaign. That remains the plan, sources confirmed.
Ron DeSantis has raised more than $100 million for his reelection bid. Could he use that money in a presidential race?
He is also expected to continue political travel outside the state to raise money and grow his brand. After avoiding public events outside Florida for most of his first term, DeSantis in August took the calculated gamble to hold rallies in support of Republican candidates in some of the country’s most contested races for governor and US Senate. He continued to travel up until 10 days before the election.
However, DeSantis stuck largely to midterm battlegrounds and avoided early nominating states where appearances can set off presidential buzz. Stephen Stepanek, the chairman of the New Hampshire Republican Party, said DeSantis’ political operation turned down multiple requests to address voters there and the state GOP has had “virtually no contact with the governor.” Despite the hype around DeSantis, Stepanek predicted it will be difficult for the Florida governor to overcome Trump in the nation’s first primary in New Hampshire. Trump’s victory in the 2016 New Hampshire primary served as the launching point to him winning the GOP nomination.
“People not only still have their 2020 signs out, but they have 2024 signs,” Stepanek said. “It’s still Trump country here in New Hampshire.”
‘When people bring up DeSantis today, I bring up Scott Walker’
Despite the tailwinds from Tuesday, DeSantis nevertheless faces an uphill climb to win over GOP primary voters whose loyalty to Trump has not wavered.
At home, Republicans are divided but seem to favor DeSantis. While 33% of Florida voters want to see Trump run again in 2024, 45% said DeSantis should take the plunge, according to the preliminary results of the Florida exit poll conducted for CNN and other news networks by Edison Research.
JC Martin, the chairman of the Polk County Republican Party, said it would be a waste for DeSantis to go up against Trump because he “still has plenty of work to do in Florida and he’s a shoo-in for 2028.”
“I’m not looking for an all-out party war in this next primary,” Martin said.
Trump grapples with 2024 questions amid GOP midterm letdown
But Shawn Foster, a Republican state committeeman for Pasco County, said the GOP “needs a new face” and he hopes it is DeSantis.
“I think the party needs it, and I think independents would look more for that,” Foster said.
Nationally, DeSantis must avoid the perception that he is peaking too soon, a pitfall for countless GOP stars who came before him.
“When people bring up DeSantis today, I bring up Scott Walker,” Bob Vander Plaats, an influential conservative leader in the early nominating state of Iowa, told CNN earlier this year, drawing comparisons to the former Wisconsin governor who was an early favorite in 2016 before his campaign stalled.
Like Walker, DeSantis’ agenda has won over conservative editorial boards and Beltway think tanks. He relishes confrontations with reporters, flaunting a brash style similar to the one that endeared New Jersey’s Chris Christie to many GOP voters. He has built a fundraising machine that rivals Florida’s Jeb Bush.
Those past governors all acted on presidential ambitions; Trump crushed their dreams.
“If in fact you go into a presidential primary with Donald Trump and think you’re going to kick his ass, you got another thing coming,” one Republican consultant in Florida told CNN.
How Trump and DeSantis are already splitting the conservative movement
Trump publicly lashed out at DeSantis in the final days of the midterm cycle while privately stewing over the perceived disloyalty from a former political disciple. He nicknamed DeSantis “Ron DeSanctimonious” at an event Saturday in Pennsylvania and held a rally in Miami two days before the election without inviting the home-state governor.
DeSantis declined to engage and instead held competing rallies on Florida’s opposite coast.
In an interview before Election Day, Trump warned against a challenge from DeSantis.
“I don’t know if he is running. I think if he runs, he could hurt himself very badly,” Trump said in an interview with Fox News Digital. “I think he would be making a mistake. I think the base would not like it – I don’t think it would be good for the party…I would tell you things about him that won’t be very flattering.”
Trump later downplayed Tuesday’s election results, noting he received “more votes” than DeSantis in Florida in 2020. Presidential races usually have much higher turnout than midterms and Trump’s margin of victory over Biden was about 3 points.
It will only grow more difficult for DeSantis to avoid talk of Trump and 2024 in the weeks ahead, though he may still try. On Wednesday morning, DeSantis, his voice hoarse from a demanding closing campaign schedule and election night celebrations, held a news conference to brief Floridians on Tropical Storm Nicole.
DeSantis didn’t mention the election results. And he left without taking questions.

Three Americans found dead from carbon monoxide poisoning at Mexico City Airbnb, official says

 — 
Three Americans died from carbon monoxide poisoning while staying at a rented apartment in Mexico City, the city attorney general’s office said.
The office began an investigation October 30, it said, looking into the “death of three foreigners, derived from possible poisoning by gas inhalation inside an apartment in the La Rosita, Cuajimalpa de Morelos.” Expert studies indicate the gas was carbon monoxide, the attorney general’s Tuesday statement said.
After detecting an intense smell of gas in the apartment, security guards at a residential complex requested support from local authorities, the statement said, and the agents who arrived found the bodies of a woman and two men.
Paramedics determined they were dead at the scene, the report said. The attorney general’s office has ordered investigations.
3 Americans found dead at a Sandals in the Bahamas last month died due to carbon monoxide poisoning, police say
The three Americans have not yet been publicly identified. The US Embassy confirmed the deaths to CNN affiliate WDSU, saying, “We are closely monitoring local authorities’ investigation into the cause of death. We stand ready to provide all appropriate consular assistance. Out of respect for the privacy of the families, we have nothing further to add at this time.”
Airbnb called the deaths a “terrible tragedy” and said it stood ready to assist with any inquiries.
“Our thoughts are with the families and loved ones as they grieve such an unimaginable loss. Our priority right now is supporting those impacted as the authorities investigate what happened,” the online home rental company said in its statement.
News of the deaths comes just months after reports that three Americans died of carbon monoxide poisoning at a Sandals resort on Bahamas’ Great Exuma island.
Two couples reported feeling ill the night of May 5 and were seen by medical staff, Bahamian police said.
The next day, Michael Phillips, 68, and his wife, Robbie Phillips, 65, of Tennessee, and Vincent Paul Chiarella, 64, of Florida, were found dead in their villas. Chiarella’s wife, Donnis, 65, was airlifted to the capital, Nassau, for further treatment before being transferred to Florida.

"HOW 2020 ELECTION DENIERS DID IN THEIR 2022 MIDTERM RACES
WHO WON, WHO LOST AND WHICH RACES ARE STILL UNCALLED
CNN Illustration/Will Mullery, CNN
By Daniel Dale, CNN
Published Nov. 9, 2022.
Updated Nov. 23, 2022.
Nobody who denied the legitimacy of the 2020 election has won a 2022 race to run future elections in a swing state.
Voters in the 2022 midterms have repudiated every fervent 2020 denier who ran for secretary of state in a state that is expected to be competitive in the 2024 presidential election, according to CNN projections. The defeated candidates include Jim Marchant of Nevada, Kristina Karamo of Michigan and Mark Finchem of Arizona.
Pennsylvania gubernatorial candidate Doug Mastriano, who would have had the power to choose his state’s election chief if he had won, has also lost. So has Arizona gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake, a particularly vehement promoter of false claims about the 2020 election.
The midterms have not, however, been a total failure for 2020 deniers. CNN projects that four Republican-dominated states have elected secretary of state candidates who rejected, questioned or tried to overturn President Joe Biden's victory. At least 18 such candidates have been elected as governor or senator, CNN projects, most of them incumbents.
Secretary of state: CNN counted 12 Republican nominees for state elections chief who rejected, questioned or tried to overturn the results of the 2020 election. CNN has projected four of those candidates as winners (all in Republican-dominated states) and eight as losers (including in Michigan, Arizona and Nevada). This means that no state expected to be a presidential battleground state in 2024 will have a 2020 denier as its elections chief.
Governor: CNN counted 22 Republican nominees for governor who rejected, questioned, tried to overturn or refused to affirm the 2020 election results. CNN has projected nine of those candidates as winners and 13 as losers, including Mastriano and Lake.
Senate: CNN counted 19 Republican nominees for the US Senate who rejected, questioned, tried to overturn or refused to affirm the 2020 results. (Senators have less power over elections than secretaries of state or governors do, but they do get a vote on certifying the Electoral College results in presidential elections and on federal elections legislation.) CNN has projected 10 of those candidates as winners and eight as losers. One, Herschel Walker of Georgia, is now in a runoff election.
You can read about the projected winners and losers in the interactive below. CNN will update this article as more information becomes available.

University of Kentucky student who repeatedly hurled racist slur at Black student permanently banned from campus

 — 
The student facing assault charges after she repeatedly hurled a racial slur at a Black student on campus early Sunday morning has been permanently banned from campus and could face additional charges, the University of Kentucky president said.
Sophia Rosing – who is no longer a student – was initially suspended on an interim basis, and is now no longer a student, permanently banned from campus, and will not be eligible to re-enroll as a student, the message from University of Kentucky (UK) President Eli Capilouto to the UK community said.
Black University of Kentucky student in viral video says she was 'physically, verbally and racially assaulted'
“Although she is no longer a student, we must continue our investigations,” Capilouto continued.
“That includes our cooperation with an investigation into criminal charges filed; our Code of Student Conduct disciplinary proceedings and racial harassment misconduct being reviewed by our Office of Institutional Equity and Equal Opportunity.”
“As a community working wholeheartedly to prevent racist violence, we also must be committed to holding people accountable for their actions. The processes we have in place are essential,” he continued.
On Tuesday, Rosing’s attorney, Fred Peters, told CNN that she plans to withdraw from UK in the next couple of days and that she is “very embarrassed, very remorseful, very humiliated.”
Rosing has been charged with alcohol intoxication in a public place, fourth-degree assault without visible injury, second-degree disorderly conduct, and third-degree assault on a police officer or probation officer, according to Kimberly Baird, the Fayette County Commonwealth’s Attorney.

New Webb telescope image shows ‘lonely’ dwarf galaxy in striking detail
By Jackie Wattles, CNN
Updated 3:49 PM EST, Wed November 9, 2022
A portion of the dwarf galaxy Wolf--Lundmark--Melotte is shown, as captured by (from left) the Spitzer Space Telescope and the James Webb Space Telescope. Webb's image shows far more detail.

CNN
 — 
The James Webb Space Telescope has snapped a remarkably detailed image of a nearby dwarf galaxy. The near-infrared view reveals the deepest glimpse yet into a stellar panorama that could offer astronomers an ideal means of studying aspects of the early universe.
The image shows a panoply of stars within a lonely dwarf galaxy called Wolf - Lundmark - Melotte, which lies about 3 million light-years from our home galaxy, the Milky Way, and is about one-tenth the size.
Ghostly figures emerge from Pillars of Creation in new Webb telescope image
The WLM galaxy is intriguing to astronomers because it has remained largely isolated and bears a similar chemical makeup to galaxies in the early universe, according to NASA.
The Webb telescope, which launched in December 2021, is the most powerful space observatory to date. It’s capable of detecting the faint light of incredibly distant galaxies as they glow in infrared light, a wavelength invisible to the human eye.
The Hubble Space Telescope and the now-defunct Spitzer Space Telescope have imaged the WLM galaxy, but Webb used its Near-Infrared Camera, also called NIRCam, to capture it in unprecedented detail.
“We can see a myriad of individual stars of different colors, sizes, temperatures, ages, and stages of evolution; interesting clouds of nebular gas within the galaxy; foreground stars with Webb’s diffraction spikes; and background galaxies with neat features like tidal tails,” said Kristen McQuinn, an assistant professor in the department of physics and astronomy at Rutgers University in Piscataway, New Jersey, in a comment posted on NASA’s website. A tidal tail is a thin “tail” of stars and interstellar gas extending off a galaxy.
“It’s really a gorgeous image,” added McQuinn, who is one of the lead scientists on the Webb Early Release Science program.
On Twitter, NASA’s official Webb telescope account declared that, compared with past space observatory images, Webb’s NIRCam image “makes the whole place shimmer” — a reference to the song “Bejeweled” on Taylor Swift’s new album, “Midnights.”
Some of the stars pictured in this latest Webb image are low-mass stars that were formed in the early universe and are able to survive for billions of years, McQuinn noted on NASA’s site.
“By determining the properties of these low-mass stars (like their ages), we can gain insight into what was happening in the very distant past,” she said.
CNN’s Ashley Strickland contributed to this report.

How common are Ponzi schemes in crypto? Crypto billionaire Sam Bankman-Fried weighs in
03:59 - Source: CNN Business
New York
CNN Business
 — 
Sam Bankman-Fried, the crypto entrepreneur known for providing a financial lifeline to struggling firms in the industry, is now in need of a bailout himself.
Bankman-Fried, widely known as SBF, started this week firmly in the realm of billionaires, with an estimated fortune of more than $15 billion, according the Bloomberg Billionaire Index. After the collapse of his crypto exchange, FTX, in a matter of days he may find himself out of the club.
Carnage in crypto markets grows as doubts emerge over FTX bailout
His most valuable assets were his stakes in FTX, the crypto exchange he founded, and Alameda, a crypto trading house.
The Bloomberg index assumes that SBF and all other investors in the exchange will be wiped out, and that FTX and Alameda will become suddenly worthless if they are bailed out by Binance. (Update: Binance said Thursday it was pulling out of the deal.)
That would leaves SBF’s net worth at about $1 billion — a 94% collapse and the biggest one-day loss by a person tracked by the index.

Hurricane Nicole, a large Category 1 storm, is closing in on the east coast of Florida

CNN
 — 
Massive Hurricane Nicole was dumping rain on Florida Wednesday night as the storm bore down on the east coast of the Sunshine State, threatening to bring damaging winds and heavy precipitation to some places still recovering from Hurricane Ian.
Earlier the storm battered the Bahamas while strengthening from a tropical storm to a Category 1 hurricane.

The eye of Nicole is expected to make landfall on the Florida coast late Wednesday or early Thursday, according to the US National Hurricane Center.
Follow live updates >>
Nicole is on a path to be the first hurricane to make landfall in the United States in November in nearly 40 years.
Here are the latest developments:
• Nicole has sustained winds of up to 75 mph after passing over the Bahamas.
• Tropical storm-force winds extend up to 485 miles from Nicole’s center, the hurricane center said. The enormous wind field – wider than that of stronger Ian on its Florida approach – means nearly the whole state will feel winds of 39 mph or greater from Nicole.
• More than 5.3 million people are under hurricane warnings and 4.1 million are under a hurricane watch.
• Around 3 to 8 inches are possible from the northwestern Bahamas to the eastern, central and northern portions of Florida. About 2 to 6 inches are expected from parts of the US southeast to the southern and central Appalachians and western mid-Atlantic through Friday, the hurricane center said.
• Coastal water levels could rise by as much as 6 feet above normal tide in the northwestern Bahamas, and up to 5 feet from Florida’s North Palm Beach to Georgia’s Altamaha Sound. Up to 4 feet of surge is possible to the south and north of that range, including through parts of South Carolina’s coast.
• Evacuations have been ordered. In some cases authorities say the buildings are unsafe, as 22 homes in Volusia County and some condo buildings in New Smyrna Beach were deemed.
• The St. John’s River, which flooded in some areas after Hurricane Ian, was approaching major flood stage near Astor and moderate flood stage near DeLand.

Elon Musk pleads with advertisers to stay on Twitter

Twitter users are flocking to Mastodon. What is it?

 — 
Twitter owner Elon Musk pleaded with advertisers to keep using his platform on Wednesday as he sketched out his plans for user verification, content moderation and even his intention to add banking features to Twitter in front of a live audience of over 100,000 users.
During an hour-long Twitter Spaces session attended by representatives from Adidas, Chevron, Kate Spade, Nissan and Walgreens, Musk said he wanted Twitter to “be a force that moves civilization in a positive direction.”
An indicator of success, he said, would be whether his decisions lead to growth in users and advertising, while failure would mean the opposite.
The collection of major advertisers and brands listening to Musk’s remarks underscored the intense interest — and perceptions of risk — generated by Musk’s erratic management of the company over the past week, from launching (and then un-launching) product changes to his sweeping layoffs that hit half the company.
Twitter briefly rolled out gray 'official' check marks. Then Elon Musk changed his mind
To his critics, and to companies that have paused advertising on Twitter, Musk asked to be given a chance.
“I understand if people want to give it a minute and see how things are evolving,” he said. “But really, the best way to see how things are evolving is just use Twitter. And see how your experience has changed. Is it better? Is it worse?”
Musk repeatedly urged skeptics to use the platform while addressing questions about his proposal to offer blue check marks to users who agree to pay $8 a month — a plan whose rollout has been marred by uncertainty and abrupt changes.
Users who pay for Twitter Blue, the platform’s subscription service, will not be required to provide identifying information other than a credit card and a phone number, Musk confirmed. Twitter will eventually default to displaying tweets from Twitter Blue subscribers, while tweets from users who do not pay for a blue check mark, he said, would be relegated to a separate page on the site and effectively buried unless viewers sought out that material.
Brands will be expected to foot the bill for their own verification on Twitter Blue, Musk said. He did not go into specifics about a separate, gray verification badge Twitter is developing for major brands, government accounts and media outlets — a feature the company has said will not be available for purchase but rather bestowed on high-profile accounts to distinguish them from those who paid for blue check marks. On Wednesday Twitter briefly appeared to have rolled out the grey check mark feature for some users, though Musk soon after tweeted that he had “killed it.” A Twitter product manager working on the feature left the door open for its eventual release.
Musk also argued, contrary to some of his critics, that well-resourced purveyors of mis- and disinformation would not be able to game the system because they would quickly run out of phone numbers and credit cards, or eventually tire of the effort.
Musk sought to distill many of the challenges of running a social media platform into a binary.
“Thinking of it as an information problem, truth is signal and falsehood is noise,” he said. “And we want to improve the signal-to-noise ratio as much as possible.”
Elon Musk's Twitter lays off employees across the company
Musk’s expansive plans for Twitter include adding financial products to the mix. It could begin, he said, with Twitter allowing users to pay each other through the platform, with the company setting up each user with an initial gift of $10 to test it out. Over time, Musk added, Twitter will offer the ability for users to transfer money out of its system to third-party banks — and then to market its own banking services.
“The next step would be a money market account so you can get an extremely high yield on your balance,” Musk said, adding that debit cards and checks could also be a part of the plan.
Last week, Twitter submitted registration paperwork to the US government that indicated its intent to join the payments industry, and to comply with certain banking regulations. A copy of the paperwork viewed by CNN showed that the Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network received the registration filing by “Twitter Payments LLC” on Nov. 4. A FinCEN spokesperson declined to comment on Twitter’s filing, which had been first reported by the New York Times on Wednesday.
Musk acknowledged brands’ concerns about the presence of hate speech and other offensive content on the platform.
“I don’t think having hate speech next to an ad is great, obviously,” he said with a chuckle.
Yoel Roth, Twitter’s head of integrity and safety, said Twitter is increasing its investment in ideas to battle hateful content.
“We think there’s a lot of other stuff we can do, from warning messages to interstitials, to reducing the reach of that content, that we haven’t fully explored in the past,” Roth said, vowing to implement those ideas quickly. Twitter has implemented many of these steps in the past, particularly in response to election and Covid-19 misinformation.
Musk said he and his teams are at work changing much of Twitter’s existing codebase, partly to support new features such as longform video. That feature, he said, will initially allow paid users to download 10 minutes of high-definition video before gradually lengthening that time limit to 40 minutes and then several hours.
And he emphasized the importance of Community Notes, formerly known as Birdwatch, a crowdsourced fact-checking feature that Twitter has been testing with some of its users.
Community Notes, he said, “will obviate the need for a lot of the content stuff that’s currently in place, I think.”
The sprawling question-and-answer session occasionally delved into the metaphorical and philosophical.
At one point, Musk appeared to acknowledge that his commitment to “free speech” was not absolute.
“There’s a giant difference between freedom of speech and freedom of reach,” he said.
Musk also described Twitter’s existing verification system as a “lords and peasants situation” and compared it to the American Revolutionary War.
“In the United States, we fought a war to get rid of that stuff,” he said. “Maybe this is a dumb decision, but we’ll see.”

How election officials staved off chaos at polling places Tuesday

CNN
 — 
In many ways, the 2022 elections were an example of the plane landing safely.
The fallout from former President Donald Trump’s lies about the 2020 election – and the fraud conspiracy theories, hostility towards election officials and promises of combative poll watching activities those falsehoods produced – did not translate into widespread chaos at precincts around the country on Tuesday.
2022 midterm election results
“We’re seeing everybody being adults,” said Kentucky Secretary of State Michael Adams, a Republican. “We’re seeing the candidates be gracious and conceding and admitting they lost.”
Several factors contributed to the mostly drama-free administration of the midterms, according to election officials and voter advocates.
Among them was the clear message election officials in key states sent that disruptions at voting sites would not be tolerated. A federal judge’s ruling that clamped down on some conduct viewed as intimidating outside of Arizona ballot drop boxes during early voting was another shot across the bow.
But it was also the two years of preparations – and lessons learned from the difficulties in responding to disinformation that surrounded Trump’s electoral loss in 2020 – that helped stave off the sort of Election Day confusion that could be exploited to cast doubt on the results.
“One of the things is we had a chance to get prepared for it – everyone did. It came out of nowhere in 2020,” said Chris Harvey, the former Georgia elections director, who is now deputy executive director of Georgia Peace Officer Standards and Training Council.
Counting continues in several key states, and there is still possibility of litigation over the vote, particularly if the margins are thin in Nevada and Arizona – where both the Senate and governors’ races are competitive – or in California, where some House races could determine control of the lower chamber.
While there was little evidence on Tuesday of disputes over voting at the polls themselves, that didn’t stop Trump and his allies who spread lies about the 2020 election from running the same playbook this year over routine issues in places like Arizona’s Maricopa County.

Still, those allegations were a reminder of the way that small administrative hiccups were seized upon to make the baseless sensationalist fraud claims that permeated the 2020 vote.
“The coming days and possible weeks will provide plenty of opportunity for domestic and foreign actors to continue to undermine our elections and manufacture chaos,” said Chris Krebs, a former Department of Homeland Security official who led the agency’s cyber security arm during the 2020 election. “It’ll be a real test of our mental toughness, but I’m much more confident today than I was yesterday in our ability to cut through the nonsense and defend democracy.”
‘This time it wasn’t a surprise’
Those in the election community said the past two years, where election officials were targeted with harassment propelled by false allegations, prepared them to work proactively to dispel those false claims.
“Election officials were acutely aware of the tense environment in which they were operating,” said Nate Persily, an election law professor at Stanford University. “Although their procedures weren’t markedly different (from 2020), they knew they were being scrutinized both by legitimate forces and conspiracy theorists.”

In Georgia, training and coordination between election officials and law enforcement helped them feel confident that they had planned for all contingencies, according to Harvey, whose agency certifies law enforcement in the state.
“When the election officials are more confident, it conveys a sense of calm and ease,” Harvey said, adding that sentiment then travels by “osmosis” to voters and the public.
Claims from election deniers there would be “tons of people out at polls” galvanized people to assist with voter protection work on Election Day, said Suzanne Almeida, director of state operations at Common Cause, a nonprofit government watchdog group.
There were some one-off episodes at polling places Tuesday, such as a man arrested after threatening voters with a knife in a Milwaukee suburb, briefly forcing one polling place to close, though there were no injuries and he was arrested without incident, police said.
At the same time, election deniers appear to have vastly overstated how large of a presence they would be at polling places, Almedia said.

“What we are seeing playing out is a right-sizing of what was purported to be a much more significant threat than ultimately came to fruition,” she said. “Sometimes with tactics like this, the story is the intimidation. It’s about making a movement seem bigger than it is, seems like making a fringe idea feel very mainstream and like it’s everywhere.”
After two years that election-deniers bragged that they would flood the polls with observers to find fraud, those promises did not lead them to producing Tuesday any legitimate evidence of mass fraud at voting sites, said Ben Ginsberg, a retired Republican lawyer, who also praised the work done by election officials to prepare for potential conspiracy theories.
“I think it was a little bit of surprise the way it played it out two years ago and this time it wasn’t a surprise,” said Ginsberg, who now co-chairs the nonpartisan Election Official Legal Defense Network, which gives legal aid to election workers. “A lot of election officials were far more transparent in explaining things, they much more knew what to watch out for.”
‘Like a virus’
Adams, the Republican Kentucky secretary of state, has battled misinformation about elections for months and has seen frivolous open requests and harassment drive local clerks out of their jobs this year in unusually high numbers.
At one point, MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell, a prominent 2020 election conspiracy theorist, took specific aim at Adams, urging his supporters to “bombard” the election chief with public records requests.
But after the FBI seized Lindell’s cell phone as part of an investigation into a Colorado election security breach, the requests and trolling quickly quieted down, Adams said. “I don’t think he lost credibility with the people who follow him, but … when he was neutralized by the FBI seizing his phone, that turned down the heat a bit.”
Lindell has not been charged with any crime.
After months of pre-election tumult, Adams on Wednesday said the election in his state had gone smoothly and candidates and their supporters remained calm.
“I think we dodged a bullet,” Adams said. But he’s concerned the peace might not last.
He noted that a competitive governor’s race will be on the ballot next year as Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear seeks reelection in the Republican-leaning state. And a heated 2024 presidential election looms after that.
“I’ve learned that election denial is like a virus,” Adams said. “You think it’s gone and then some new variant pops up. So, it’s in a dormant stage right now, and I think it will be fine for several months and then come back.”
‘Where is everybody?’
Trump’s allies who vocally spread the former president’s lies about the 2020 election zeroed-in Tuesday on Arizona’s Maricopa County, where a printer issue at several precincts prevented some ballots from being properly scanned.
“They are trying to steal the election with bad Machines and DELAY. Don’t let it happen!” Trump wrote on his social media.
Charlie Kirk, the founder and president of right-wing group Turning Point USA, tweeted a false claim about two-hour wait times in Maricopa County Tuesday afternoon – which the county rebutted in a tweet.
The use of social media to fuel doubts about the vote machines mirrored the tactics from Trump’s supporters in 2020, when they spread wild and baseless claims about alleged fraud involving USB drives and the use of felt-tipped sharpies to fill out ballots that were patently false.
On Tuesday evening, a county judge on denied a bid by Republicans to extend polling hours by three hours because of the voting machine issues, saying there was no evidence the snafu had prevented anyone from voting.
“If people have instances or proof of fraud we want to hear that. But up to this point we have not,” Maricopa Board of Supervisors Chair Bill Gates told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer on Wednesday. “And right now, we are laser focused on getting through this count and doing it in an accurate way.”
Still, that didn’t stop GOP gubernatorial nominee Kari Lake – one of several statewide Arizona nominees who has embraced Trump’s false claims the 2020 election was stolen – from claiming in a speech late Tuesday there could be problems with the results, saying she felt like it was “Groundhog Day.”
In anticipation of protests Tuesday evening, the Maricopa County Sheriff’s Office blocked off the areas where protesters had gathered in 2020 Tuesday evening with seven-foot-tall chain-link fencing. A police helicopter circled overhead, more than a dozen sheriff’s deputies milled around the perimeter of the fencing and a group of officers on horseback periodically rode along Third Avenue.
But the expected protests didn’t materialize. By 10 p.m. local time, just a few people had gathered outside the fence: a white-haired man holding a large American flag and two younger men wearing balaclavas, one in a shirt that read “F–k Antifa.”
That man asked a reporter, “Where is everybody?”

Control of the Senate and House still in the balance: All eyes are on undecided Arizona and Nevada Senate races, as Georgia's contest heads to a Dec. 6 runoff. At least 400,000 votes remain to be counted in Arizona's Maricopa County alone, officials said.
Democrats flip key Senate seat: Democrat John Fetterman flipped Pennsylvania's Senate seat, CNN projected, boosting Democratic hopes of keeping their majority. Both parties now need two seats to win control of the Senate.
Biden addresses the country: President Biden called the midterms a ""good day for America,"" noting that the ""giant red wave"" that was predicted didn't happen and that it's still possible that Democrats hold the House.
Historic firsts: Both parties are diversifying their ranks. Here's a look at the candidates CNN projects will make history.

Biden on 2024 plans: ""Our intention is to run again""
From CNN's Betsy Klein and Mike Hayes

President Joe Biden said Wednesday that it remains his ""intention"" to run for reelection in 2024.
In remarks from the White House after the midterm elections, Biden noted that he is not in “any hurry” to announce a reelection bid as his predecessor, former President Donald Trump, teases an announcement set for next week.
The president said he continues to deliberate with his wife, first lady Dr. Jill Biden, reiterating that his timeline won’t be influenced by Trump and remains “early next year.”
Asked how he interprets last night's results in terms of seeking another term — and whether the results make it more likely — Biden said the results did not impact him and his family's thinking.
""Our intention is to run again. That's been our intention. Regardless of what the outcome of this election was,"" Biden said after joking that his wife Jill, who was sitting in the audience during his White House remarks, is more popular than him in the Democratic Party.
Biden, who at 79 is the oldest president in American history, added the caveat that Democrats outperforming expectations in the elections provided “whew – a sigh of relief that the mega-Republicans are not taking over the government again.” 
But, he said, “My intention is that I will run again, but I'm a great respecter of fate. And this is all made a family decision. I think everybody wants me to run, but we're gonna have discussions about it. And I don't feel any hurry one way or another to make that judgment – right – today, tomorrow, whenever, no matter what my predecessor does.” 
The president said he hopes he and the first lady get time to “sneak away” around the holidays as he reiterated, “My guess is that it’ll be early next year to make that judgment, but that is my plan to do it.”
Biden’s top advisers are making plans toward a 2024 reelection bid, even as he has not yet made a decision on whether to throw his hat into the ring again. Senior White House adviser Anita Dunn said Wednesday that planning for a potential campaign is already underway, regardless of Biden’s decision.
Biden later dismissed midterm exit polling that suggested a majority of voters do not want him to run for re-election. Asked whether that data impacts his decision, he sharply responded, “It doesn’t.”
And his message to those opposed to another presidential bid: “Watch me.”
Biden also bristled at a question of who would be a tougher 2024 Republican competitor: Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis or Trump. 
“It’d be fun watching them take on each other,” he said, declining to elaborate.
CNN's Betsy Klein contributed reporting to this post.

Biden says it's possible Democrats still hold onto the House but ""it's going to be very close""
President Joe Biden answers questions from reporters on Wednesday. (Susan Walsh/AP)
President Biden was asked about House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy's comment last night that Republicans are going to take the House majority back — and whether he thinks McCarthy is right.
Biden responded that he thinks Democrats still have the possibility of holding onto the chamber, but he noted that ""it's going to be close.""
""It's a moving target right now but it's going to be very close,"" the President said at a news conference Wednesday afternoon.
Biden was asked about his relationship with McCarthy. He said that he hasn't spoken to him much but believes that he'll be talking to him later today.
In terms of how they'll potentially work together moving forward, Biden said, ""there is always enough people on the other team, whether Democrat a Republican that the opposite party can make an appeal to, maybe pick them off to get the help.""

Trump indicates he still plans to make 2024 announcement next week

In an interview with Fox News Digital Wednesday, former President Donald Trump said that reports he was “furious” following the midterm results were not true.
“It is just the opposite,” Trump said, ""The people I endorsed did very well. I was batting 98.6% in the primaries, and 216 to 19 in the general election — that is amazing.""
Trump went on to praise several of the candidates that he endorsed including Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, both of whom Trump rallied for. Grassley and Rubio were both strongly favored to win before Trump appeared along side them. 
Trump also had favorable words for celebrity Dr. Mehmet Oz who lost his senatorial bid in Pennsylvania to Lt. Gov John Fetterman.
""Oz worked very hard, but there were forces against him,"" Trump said. ""Oz is a great guy. He had a lot of immovable forces against him.""
Asked if the lackluster results would change Trump’s decision to announce a third presidential run next Tuesday, the former president indicated he would be forging ahead with that plan.
""We had tremendous success…. Why would anything change?” Trump said.

Biden says he is ""prepared to work with my Republican colleagues"" as he discusses midterm results

President Joe Biden signaled on Wednesday how he would try to work across the aisle if Republicans win the House, but made clear there are some issues he won't compromise on. CNN has not yet projected control of the House.
""I'm prepared to work with my Republican colleagues,"" Biden said. ""The American people have made clear, I think, that they expect Republicans to be prepared to work with me as well.""
Biden indicated he hopes there will continue to be cooperation across the aisle to deliver aid to Ukraine. ""In the area of foreign policy, I hope we will continue a bipartisan approach of confronting Russia's aggression in Ukraine.""
Biden also outlined what he does not want to see happen. ""I'm not going to support any Republican proposal that's going to make inflation worse,"" and ""I'm not going to walk away from historic commitments we just made to take on the climate crisis.""
Winning the House majority would give Republicans power to set the agenda in the chamber. House Republicans would also have subpoena power and control over powerful committees – and they have made clear they would make investigations into the Biden administration a top priority. 
On the legislative front, there would be some must-pass policy issues — like funding the government — that would test the ability of Republicans and Democrats to work together if the GOP controls the House.
Asked if he believed the ""MAGA fever"" has been broken, Biden said, ""I don't think we are going to break the fever for the super mega MAGA Republicans. But I think they are more minority of Republican party. I think the vast majority of party, we disagree strongly on issues, but they are decent.""

Biden on voter frustration: ""I get it""

President Biden addressed voter frustrations, despite Democrats performing better than expected this election season, during his remarks from the White House saying, ""I get it.""
""The voters were also clear that they're still frustrated. I get it. I understand it has been a really tough few years in this country for so many people,"" Biden said.
He went on to list the ways his administration is tackling obstacles like the Covid-19 pandemic and a reeling economy.
""And we're just getting started. The interesting thing is that this is all going to really come into clear view for people in the month of — in the months of January, February, March of next year. It's just getting underway. So I am optimistic about how the public is going to be even more embracive of what we've done,"" the president said.

President Biden says the ""giant red wave"" that was predicted didn't happen

President Joe Biden opened his remarks this afternoon by calling Tuesday's midterm elections ""a good day, I think, for Democracy"" and a ""good day for America."" 
""The American people have spoken, it shows that Democracy is who we are,"" the President said. He added that the election happened ""without much interference at all or any.""
While acknowledging that all the results are not in, Biden went on to discuss the results that we do know at this stage.
""While the press and pundits are predicting a giant red wave, it didn't happen,"" he said. ""I know you were somewhat miffed by my obsessing optimism, but I felt good during the whole process.”
Biden said that any seat lost by his party is painful. But he pointed out that his party ""lost fewer seats in the House of Representatives than any Democratic presidents' first midterm election in the last 40 years.""

NOW: President Biden speaks as control of Congress is still undecided
From CNN's Kevin Liptak
President Biden is addressing reporters from the White House as the control of Congress still hangs in the balance.
Biden appeared to withstand historic and political headwinds in the midterm elections, staving off resounding Republican wins even as his presidency is now likely entering a new period of divided government.
The results were neither the ""thumping"" George W. Bush described during his own post-midterms press conference in 2006 nor the ""shellacking'"" Barack Obama said Democrats endured in 2010.
Instead, the failure of a so-called ""red wave"" to materialize Tuesday night had Democrats, including those inside the White House, feeling enthused and vindicated following an election season where Biden's political aptitude was questioned.
The results appeared more likely to prompt soul-searching among Republicans than Democrats, as former President Donald Trump teases an imminent announcement that he is running for the White House again. Many of the candidates Trump endorsed in toss-up races lost or were locked in contests that were too early to call.
Still, Biden and his team still face the prospect of a difficult two years of governing should Republicans seize control of the House of Representatives. The president’s agenda would likely be sharply curtailed without a Democratic majority. And Republicans have promised investigations into Biden’s administration and family.

Stocks slip as control of Congress remains unclear
From CNN's Paul R. La Monica
Wall Street was betting on a red wave in the midterm elections Tuesday, but investors saw red on their trading screens Wednesday when that didn’t happen. 
Stocks ended the day broadly lower, with the Dow plunging more than 645 points, or 2%. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq fell 2.1% and 2.5% respectively. 
The market rallied sharply during the past three days following a historic surge for stocks in October. That was due in part to expectations of a convincing victory for Republicans that could give the party control of one or both chambers of Congress — a development that could lead to more investor-friendly gridlock. But it's not yet clear if Democrats will actually lose their majority in either chamber. 
Still, as the midterm dust settles, investors may now shift their attention back to inflation and the economy. The government will report the October consumer price index figures Thursday morning. Investors are hoping that if inflation continues to cool, the Fed may be able to finally slow the pace of interest rate hikes following four consecutive increases of three-quarters of a point.
Facebook owner Meta Platforms also confirmed a major round of layoffs, but the stock rallied more than 5% on the news.

CNN Projection: Republican John James will win Michigan’s 10th District 
From CNN staff
John James' win in Michigan is a pick up for the Republican Party. (John James/Handout/Reuters)
Republican John James will win Michigan’s 10th District, CNN projects, defeating Democrat Carl Marlinga.
This is a Republican pickup.
Here's where things stand in the House: 
Current total of House races called for Democrats: 187
Current total of House races called for GOP: 204
Number of uncalled House races remaining: 44
Remember: In the House, the party with at least 218 seats has the majority and, assuming it can unite behind one candidate, selects the Speaker of the House

 — 
In his first speech since polls closed around the country Tuesday night, President Joe Biden called out detractors who he said doubted his “incessant optimism” about Democrats’ ability to stave off resounding Republican wins in the midterm elections – even as his presidency is now likely entering a new period of divided government.
Takeaways from the 2022 midterm elections: Battle for control of the House and Senate still up in the air
The results, he said during a press conference at the White House Wednesday, are a sign American democracy is intact, despite coming under threat over the past several years.
“We had an election yesterday,” Biden said. “And it was a good day, I think, for democracy.”
“Our democracy has been tested in recent years, but with their votes, the American people have spoken and proven once again that democracy is who we are,” he continued, adding that “while the press and the pundits are predicting a giant red wave, it didn’t happen.”
The results were neither the “thumping” George W. Bush described during his own post-midterms press conference in 2006 nor the “shellacking’” Barack Obama said Democrats endured in 2010.
Instead, the failure of a so-called “red wave” to materialize Tuesday night had Biden appearing confident, reflecting the mood of Democrats, including those inside the White House, who are feeling enthused and vindicated following an election season where the president’s political aptitude was questioned. At the time of Biden’s remarks, CNN has not been able to project the future majorities of the House or the Senate.
The president did concede that the results are not a ringing endorsement of his approach. Voters, he said, “were also clear that they are still frustrated. I get it. I understand it’s been a really tough few years this country for so many people.”
“While any seat lost is painful … Democrats had a strong night. And we lost fewer seats in the House of Representatives than any Democratic president’s first midterm election in the last 40 years. We had the best midterm for governors since 1986,” Biden remarked.
Inside Joe Biden's cautiously optimistic election night
The president, who turns 80 later this month, also said he is not in “any hurry” to announce a bid for reelection in 2024, reiterating that his timeline remains “early next year.”
“Our intention is to run again. That’s been our intention, regardless of what the outcome of this election was,” he told reporters. Still, Biden added, he’s “a great respecter of fate,” calling another run “a family decision.
“I think everybody wants me to run, but we’re gonna have discussions about it,” he said.
And Biden had a message to those opposed to another presidential bid: “Watch me.”
The future of both parties
The president said he will be inviting leaders of both parties in Congress to the White House to discuss where they can work together when he returns from his upcoming overseas trip, adding that he’s prepared to work with elected Republicans on a number of issues. “The American people have made clear, I think, that they expect Republicans to be prepared to work with me, as well,” he added.
Still, Biden drew a red line on a number of Republican proposals, saying he’d veto legislation he thinks could make inflation worse, cuts to Social Security and Medicare, as well as any attempt to introduce a national ban on abortion.
Biden said he plans to speak with House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy – who is mounting a run for House speaker – later on Wednesday.
Exit polls: High inflation dominates voters' views in the midterm elections
The results appeared more likely to prompt soul-searching among Republicans than Democrats, as former President Donald Trump teases an imminent announcement that he is running for the White House again. Many of the candidates Trump endorsed in toss-up races lost or were locked in contests that were too early to call.
For his part, Biden said on Wednesday that he does not plan to do anything differently in the second half of his presidential term. Instead, he said as his agenda items begin taking effect, Americans would come to see their benefit.
“They’re just finding out what we’re doing,” the president said. “The more they know about what we’re doing, the more support there is.”
Still, Biden and his team still face the prospect of a difficult two years of governing should Republicans seize control of the House. The President’s agenda would likely be sharply curtailed without a Democratic majority. And Republicans have promised investigations into Biden’s administration and family.
Biden said he believes the American public wants the government to “move on and get things done for them,” not lead investigations into him, his family or his administration.
“It’s just, almost comedy,” Biden said of the possible probes. “I can’t control what they’re going to do. All I can do is continue to try to make life better for the American people.”
Abortion rights were on the ballot in these states. Here's what voters decided
Exit polls also indicated still-simmering dissatisfaction among voters at the country’s economic health. Around three-quarters of voters nationally said the economy is “poor” or “not good,” and the same share said that inflation has caused them severe or moderate hardship. About two-thirds said that gas prices have been causing them hardship.
Voters have a dour view about the way things are going in the country generally, with more than 7 in 10 saying they are “dissatisfied” or “angry.”
For the president, improving the country’s pervasive dark mood will be an ongoing challenge despite Democrats outperforming expectations Tuesday. Without a majority in the House, his tools to accomplish that will be more limited.
Biden spent most of his campaign season focused on economic issues, including areas he’d taken action to reduce costs. But he drew some criticism, including from some Democrats, for expanding his closing message to including abortion rights and a defense of democracy.
Heading into Tuesday, Biden advisers were prepared to defend the tactic and were prepared with historic data showing Democrats faring better this year than in previous midterm cycles, which typically result in losses for the sitting president’s party.
Ultimately, however, Biden is likely to avoid the finger-pointing and second-guessing. Even with the House losses, this year’s results are among the best for the party in power in recent memory.
By comparison, Democrats lost 54 seats in 1994, when President Bill Clinton was in office. And Obama’s first midterm election saw his party lose 63 seats.
Biden addresses foreign policy issues and Elon Musk’s influence
Speaking in front of the press on Wednesday, Biden addressed challenges with two of the nation’s biggest foreign adversaries – China and Russia.
Biden said the timing of Russia’s announcement on retreating from the city of Kherson, Ukraine, was “interesting.”
“I find it interesting they waited until after the election to make that judgment, which we knew for some time they were going to be doing, and it’s evidence of the fact that they have some real problems – the Russian military,” Biden said. He added that where the withdrawal leads and “whether or not Ukraine is prepared to compromise with Russia” remain to be seen.
Biden also said he was told that Russian President Vladimir Putin was not likely to attend the upcoming G20 summit in Indonesia. He also told reporters that he’s hopeful Putin will be more willing to discuss the release of WNBA star Brittney Griner, who remains detained in Russia, now that the elections are over.
Biden confirmed expected talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping at next week’s G20 summit. Biden said he’s not planning to make any “fundamental concessions” and that they will discuss the economy and trade. But he declined to reveal what his message would be on US military support to Taiwan should China move on the self-governing island.
“I’m gonna have that conversation with him,” Biden added, noting that they’ll lay out “what each of our red lines are.”
The president also told reporters that Twitter owner Elon Musk’s relationship with other countries was “worthy of being looked at,” but declined to say how that could be done.
“I think that Elon Musk’s cooperation and/or technical relationships with other countries is worthy of being looked at, whether or not he is doing anything inappropriate,” Biden said, when asked if Musk was a threat to national security. “But that’s all (I’ll) say.”

Gun hidden in a raw chicken found at Florida TSA checkpoint

(CNN) — A gun found inside a raw chicken at an airport security checkpoint has the TSA calling ""personal fowl.""
""The plot chickens,"" the Transportation Security Administration posted this week on Instagram after someone at the agency put on their punny pants and called attention to the ""baste of time"" that is stuffing a bird with a firearm.
The passenger was headed to Port-au-Prince, Haiti, according to Sari Koshetz, a TSA spokesperson for the Gulf region.
Nestor Iglesias, a spokesperson for Homeland Security Investigations, the investigative arm of the US Department of Homeland Security, said he could not offer additional details because it is an ""ongoing criminal case which has been accepted for prosecution.""
A record number of guns have arrived at TSA checkpoints in Florida in 2022. Passengers have brought more than 700 guns to checkpoints at airports in the state so far this year -- a year-to-date number that already surpasses any previous year, according to a TSA news release.
Records have been set at 12 Florida airports, with airports in Orlando (129 guns), Fort Lauderdale (120 guns) and Tampa (102 guns) leading the way.
Nearly all of the guns discovered at checkpoints were loaded, the TSA said, and most had ammunition chambered.
""An accidental discharge could result in tragedy,"" the TSA's Koshetz said in a statement. ""Every passenger bares the responsibility of knowing exactly where their gun is before entering the security checkpoint.""
For many passengers, bringing guns to airports resulted in arrests and notices to appear in court.
Civil penalties from the TSA can reach $13,910 even if the passenger is not arrested, the TSA's news release said.
Firearms must be packed in checked luggage. The TSA outlines specific rules related to guns and ammunition on its website.

Three Americans found dead from carbon monoxide poisoning at Mexico City Airbnb, official says
By Omar Astorga, Florencia Trucco and Hande Atay Alam, CNN
Published 1:06 PM EST, Wed November 9, 2022

CNN
 — 
Three Americans died from carbon monoxide poisoning while staying at a rented apartment in Mexico City, the city attorney general’s office said.
The office began an investigation October 30, it said, looking into the “death of three foreigners, derived from possible poisoning by gas inhalation inside an apartment in the La Rosita, Cuajimalpa de Morelos.” Expert studies indicate the gas was carbon monoxide, the attorney general’s Tuesday statement said.
After detecting an intense smell of gas in the apartment, security guards at a residential complex requested support from local authorities, the statement said, and the agents who arrived found the bodies of a woman and two men.
Paramedics determined they were dead at the scene, the report said. The attorney general’s office has ordered investigations.
3 Americans found dead at a Sandals in the Bahamas last month died due to carbon monoxide poisoning, police say
The three Americans have not yet been publicly identified. The US Embassy confirmed the deaths to CNN affiliate WDSU, saying, “We are closely monitoring local authorities’ investigation into the cause of death. We stand ready to provide all appropriate consular assistance. Out of respect for the privacy of the families, we have nothing further to add at this time.”
Airbnb called the deaths a “terrible tragedy” and said it stood ready to assist with any inquiries.
“Our thoughts are with the families and loved ones as they grieve such an unimaginable loss. Our priority right now is supporting those impacted as the authorities investigate what happened,” the online home rental company said in its statement.
News of the deaths comes just months after reports that three Americans died of carbon monoxide poisoning at a Sandals resort on Bahamas’ Great Exuma island.
Two couples reported feeling ill the night of May 5 and were seen by medical staff, Bahamian police said.
The next day, Michael Phillips, 68, and his wife, Robbie Phillips, 65, of Tennessee, and Vincent Paul Chiarella, 64, of Florida, were found dead in their villas. Chiarella’s wife, Donnis, 65, was airlifted to the capital, Nassau, for further treatment before being transferred to Florida.

As US heads towards a potentially divided government, Biden aims to assert American leadership abroad
From CNN's Kevin Liptak
(Susan Walsh/AP)
It’s a story President Joe Biden tells at nearly every opportunity: last year, meeting his new counterparts at his first international summit, he proudly informed them, “America is back.”
“For how long?” one of them asked.
As Biden departs this week for a weeklong around-the-world trip, the question still resonates.
“If the United States tomorrow were to, quote, withdraw from the world, a lot of things would change around the world. A whole lot would change,” Biden said ahead of his trip.
Biden hopes his stops at a climate meeting here on the Red Sea, a gathering of Southeast Asian nations in Cambodia and a high-stakes Group of 20 summit on the Indonesian island of Bali will assert American leadership in areas former President Donald Trump either ignored or actively shunned.
Four defining global threats will loom over Biden’s trip: Russia’s war in Ukraine, escalating tensions with China, the existential problem of climate change and the potential for a global recession in the coming months. Other flashpoints, like North Korea’s rapidly accelerating provocations and uncertainty over Iran’s nuclear program, will also factor in. 
Of those, defending Ukraine and combating climate change could be the most impacted by results from this week’s election. 
At moments of domestic political turmoil, US presidents have often turned to foreign policy, where they can act with relatively few congressional restraints. President Barack Obama launched a similar tour of Asia after his self-described “shellacking” in the 2010 midterms. 
Biden and his advisers believe they are entering the series of high-stakes meetings with a solid argument that his version of the US role in the world will endure. He resisted historical and political headwinds in this year’s midterm elections while many of Trump’s handpicked candidates lost. And over the past year, he secured passage of a major climate investment and rallied the world behind efforts to support Ukraine and isolate Russia.
Yet the anxieties of American allies persist over the future of US commitments – to Ukraine, to fighting climate change, to treaty partners and, perhaps most urgently, to upholding Democratic norms. Foreign diplomats have watched intently as the midterm political season played out, searching for clues to how the American electorate was judging Biden's first two years in office and reporting back to their capitals on voter dissatisfaction that could fuel Trump's return to office.
As of Wednesday night, Republicans appeared to be moving toward gaining control of the House of Representatives. And Trump is readying a third presidential bid, potentially to be announced while Biden is on the opposite side of the planet.

Senate control could hinge on two states with prominent election deniers 
From CNN's Maeve Reston

Control of the US Senate could hinge on Nevada and Arizona, two states where GOP victories could elevate some of the most prominent election deniers in the country even after other nominees who had amplified former President Donald Trump’s falsehoods about the 2020 election were rejected by voters in Tuesday’s midterm elections.
Those two western states – perpetual battlegrounds in presidential years – were still too early to call as of early Thursday morning, while a third Democratic-held seat, Georgia, will advance to a December runoff, CNN projects. Republicans need to pick off two Democratic seats to win the majority. As ballots continue to be counted across the country, Republicans appear to be slowly inching toward the 218 seats that would deliver them a House majority, albeit one that’s much narrower than they’d hoped.
The struggle for the Senate, however, is still full of unknowns – including whether it will all come down once again to Georgia after the Peach State delivered Democrats the majority in 2021 with victories in twin runoffs. It’s Nevada and Arizona that will determine how pivotal Georgia becomes.
Arizona Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly was maintaining an edge over Republican Blake Masters as of early Thursday morning, while Nevada Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto was trailing Republican Adam Laxalt. CNN had estimated late Wednesday that about 600,000 votes remained to be counted across the Grand Canyon State and about 160,000 votes remained to be counted in Nevada.
Nevada: Laxalt, the state's former attorney general, was a co-chairman of Trump’s 2020 presidential campaign in the state and filed lawsuits attempting to overturn Nevada’s results in that election, which he said was “rigged.” Cortez Masto had argued that the lies and election conspiracy theories embraced by Trump and allies like Laxalt led to the attack on the US Capitol on January 6, 2021.
Arizona: Masters, a venture capitalist and first-time candidate, released a campaign video as he was competing for the GOP nomination in which he said he believed Trump had won the 2020 election. Masters, like Laxalt, clinched Trump’s endorsement.
After winning the Arizona Senate primary, Masters briefly appeared to back away from some of that extreme rhetoric – scrubbing his website, for example, of language that included the false claim that the election was stolen. In a debate with Kelly, he also conceded that he had not seen evidence of fraud that would have changed the outcome of the election. But the Republican nominee seemed to reverse course after receiving a phone call from Trump urging him to “go stronger” on election denialism, a conversation that was captured in a Fox documentary.

Analysis: A midterm stalemate will unleash turmoil and acrimony in run up to 2024
From CNN's Stephen Collinson
US democracy, which almost buckled two years ago, just delivered a perfect reflection of a polarized nation that mistrusts its leaders and isn’t ready to unite on a new path.
Tuesday’s midterm elections gave Americans two more years to collectively decide what they really want by likely ushering in a divided government that is certain to be acrimonious but will prevent Democrats or Republicans from engineering a major ideological shift. It also scrambled the terrain of the early 2024 presidential race, with President Joe Biden and ex-President Donald Trump both moving toward new campaigns that much of the country appears not to want.
A divided government would mean two years of dysfunction, bitterness, fiscal cliffs and debt showdowns between a Republican House and the Democratic White House. Token talk of bipartisan cooperation won’t last long. Even if Democrats somehow manage to cling to the House as final results trickle in, they’d also lack the leeway to pass nation-changing laws. And whoever wins the Senate majority, the chamber will effectively be split down the middle and locked in an angry stalemate. Like America itself.
What this means for 2024: The election results pose new questions heading into the next White House campaign over the prospects of both Trump and Biden. Trump’s obsession with promoting chaos candidates in his image may yet again doom Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell’s chances of returning as majority leader. Trump, of course, is already blaming everyone but himself as he eyes a campaign launch next week that will lack the springboard of a Republican landslide he would have claimed was all his doing. And the roaring reelection of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis presented Trump with a huge potential 2024 GOP primary headache.
Biden, meanwhile, seemed unusually upbeat for a president who may soon face a tsunami of subpoenas, investigations and even possible impeachment from a GOP House. He enjoyed calling out the conventional wisdom during a White House news conference on Wednesday afternoon. “While the press and the pundits were predicting a giant red wave, it didn’t happen,” he said.
When Biden meets world leaders in the coming days in Egypt and Bali, Indonesia, he can crow about escaping the epic first-term shellacking suffered by most presidents. He also put off an immediate inquest about his suitability to carry the Democratic banner into 2024, ahead of a vacation he said he’d like to take between Thanksgiving and Christmas with First Lady Jill Biden to consider his future.
Yet a loss is a loss. And CNN exit polls show only 30% of House race voters want a president with a low-40s approval rating, who will be 80 in a few weeks, to run for reelection in a campaign that could well coincide with the recession many economists fear. Biden would prefer another finding from those same polls, however, that showed Trump – with a 39% approval rating – is even less popular.

Here's where things stand with the balance of power in the Senate and the House
From CNN's Ethan Cohen
With the day after the election wrapping up, control of Congress remains undetermined.
Republicans hold 49 seats in the Senate, while the Democrats have 48. Two states are uncalled and Georgia's Senate seat will be decided by a December runoff election.
In the House, it could be days until a full picture emerges as votes are still being counted in states like California, Oregon, Nevada and Arizona. 
Senate
It's still too early to call which party will gain control of the Senate.
Democrats have had the only pickup so far with John Fetterman’s win in Pennsylvania, but they still need to win two more seats to guarantee control. 
On Wednesday, CNN projected that GOP Sen. Ron Johnson would hold his seat in Wisconsin and that Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock and Republican Herschel Walker will be headed to a Dec. 6 runoff in Georgia. 
CNN hasn’t made a projection of party control in two other seats – Arizona and Nevada. 
As of 11:30 p.m. ET, Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona was ahead of Republican Blake Masters by about 95,000 votes after a vote report from Maricopa County expanded Kelly’s lead. CNN estimates that as of 11:30 p.m. Wednesday, about 600,000 votes remain to be counted in Arizona.
In Nevada, Republican Adam Laxalt currently leads the count against Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto. CNN estimates that as of 11:30 p.m. Wednesday, about 160,000 votes remain to be counted in Nevada.
Nightly vote reports from the largest counties are expected in both states.
While CNN has projected that Alaska’s Senate seat will be controlled by Republicans, CNN has not projected whether Sen. Lisa Murkowski or Kelly Tshibaka will prevail. If neither gets over 50% of first-choice votes, the contest will be decided by ranked-choice voting. 
 Click here for the most up-to-date numbers. 
House
There are currently 35 uncalled House races – Democrats lead in the vote count in 24 of them as of 11:30 p.m. while Republicans lead in 11. 
Republicans need to win 9 more seats to reach the 218 needed to control the House, Democrats need to win 27 more seats to reach 218.

Analysis: Why the news media got the midterm ""red wave"" narrative so wrong
From CNN's Oliver Darcy
The White House believes that the press has “egg on their faces, yet again.”
That’s according to a White House official who spoke candidly with CNN on Wednesday about the media’s “red wave” narrative that wasn’t.
Heading into Tuesday, the dominant narrative in the press — especially right-wing media — was that Republicans were on track to have a big, if not monster, night. Focusing largely on the fragile state of the economy, coupled with the fact that the incumbent party historically doesn’t perform well in such elections, the press had all but declared that Democrats would get trounced from coast-to-coast.
But as election results came in Tuesday night, the great wave turned into a mere ripple. Pundits such as Ben Shapiro noted the view had gone “from red wave to red wedding.” Even on Fox News, the right-wing cable network that had heavily hyped the red wave presumption to its audience, pundits acknowledged the reality. Marc Thiessen, a former speechwriter for President George W. Bush, called it an “absolute disaster” for the GOP.
So what happened?

Female governors will break a record in 2023

The US will have a record number of female governors in 2023. Still, the record-setting number – 12 – will represent a small fraction of the top executives across the 50 states.
The previous record of nine female governors serving concurrently was set in 2004, according to the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University.
Incumbent female governors in Maine, Alabama, Michigan, Iowa, South Dakota, Kansas and New Mexico won reelection on Tuesday, while New York Gov. Kathy Hochul won a first full term after taking over the top job in 2021 following the resignation of Andrew Cuomo. Hochul will become the first elected female governor in the state.
Two states – Massachusetts and Arkansas – elected new female governors. Democrat Maura Healey will become the first woman elected to the governorship of Massachusetts and the first out lesbian governor in the US. Republican Sarah Huckabee Sanders, a former White House press secretary in the Trump administration, will become the state’s first female governor, winning the job that her father once held.
Arkansas and Massachusetts will also become the first states to have women serving in the governor and lieutenant governor positions at the same time, according to CAWP.

Voters deliver ringing endorsement of abortion rights via midterm ballot initiatives
From CNN's Veronica Stracqualursi, Devan Cole and Paul LeBlanc

Voters in key states on Tuesday made their support for abortion rights clear, affirming a months-long push by Democrats to act on a number of ballot measures in the wake of the Supreme Court’s decision overturning Roe v. Wade.
Several states moved to enshrine abortion protections in their constitutions and others rejected proposals to limit abortion access or criminalize doctors in some cases. Democratic lawmakers and organizers cast the midterm elections as a referendum on Republican efforts to limit women’s choices, and the notable electoral reaction could serve as a warning sign for future GOP efforts to restrict the procedure at the state level.
About 27% of voters cited abortion as the issue most important to them, according to the preliminary results of the national and state exit polls conducted for CNN and other news networks by Edison Research. The results also showed that when it comes to the issue, roughly half of voters said they trusted Democratic candidates, compared with more than four in 10 voters who said they trusted Republican candidates.
“This fall, Roe is on the ballot,” President Joe Biden declared in a defiant speech from the White House just hours after the Supreme Court’s ruling earlier this year.
While CNN projected some anti-abortion Republicans will win their races, voters in five states moved to affirm abortion rights.

 — 
Donald Trump wanted to catapult himself into a third presidential campaign with a wave of Republican midterm gains behind him. Instead, he emerges from Tuesday’s underwhelming election night facing questions about his political future and with the momentum behind Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, potentially his potential chief nemesis in a 2024 primary.
With key races still too early to call in Arizona and Nevada, and with Georgia heading to a Senate runoff, Trump entered Wednesday with few victories to tout and the possibility that they might soon be overshadowed by further losses.
2022 midterm election results
His chosen candidates for open Senate seats in Ohio and North Carolina prevailed, as did incumbent Republican Sen. Ron Johnson in Wisconsin. But he lost a critical Senate contest in Pennsylvania, where Mehmet Oz, whom he backed in the primary despite widespread concerns about his electability, was defeated by Democratic Lt. Gov. John Fetterman. In Michigan, Trump’s candidate in the governor’s race failed to unseat Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. And while Republicans still appear to be on track to capture a House majority, it is likely to be far slimmer than initially thought.
As powerful as Trump is in the Republican Party, we learned that he cannot anoint anyone a winner. You still need candidates who have the fundamentals,” said Bryan Lanza, a longtime Trump adviser.
Others were more blunt in their assessment of Tuesday’s known outcomes.

Ex-Trump official: Election shows that Trump is holding GOP back
00:49 - Source: CNN
Rep. Troy Nehls, a Texas Republican who won reelection and was endorsed by Trump, appeared to cast the former president as a drag on other GOP candidates in a radio interview Wednesday.
“There’s just a lot of negative attitudes about Trump,” Nehls said. In a statement to CNN after this story published, the congressman said he remains supportive of Trump and “will support him as the 47th president.”
In the early hours of Wednesday morning, a current Trump adviser, who requested anonymity for fear of retribution, conceded that Trump “is in a tough spot coming out of tonight.”
“Two narratives are going to take hold over the next week and neither one is going to be easy to dispel,” the adviser said.
Acutely aware of his unprecedented involvement in Republican primaries earlier this year, this adviser and other Trump allies said they expect the former president will be blamed for elevating flawed candidates in some of the party’s most important contests – especially Oz, a daytime talk show host who had barely resided in Pennsylvania before launching his Senate campaign there.
Trump’s disappointment was palpable inside the gilded ballroom at his Mar-a-Lago estate, where he gathered with dozens of aides, allies and donors to watch returns on Tuesday evening. When he returned to the party halfway through the night following a private dinner, his mood had visibly shifted.
“Interesting evening,” he shouted to reporters before taking the stage for brief and unenthused remarks.
As the crowd dwindled, Trump sat at a table in front of a television tuned to Fox News with just a handful of advisers. Meanwhile, several guests whose names appeared on a VIP list that one Trump adviser circulated to reporters were nowhere to be found, including some who apparently decided to skip the event – surfacing as television pundits throughout the night from studios elsewhere in the country.
The end result was the exact scenario Trump’s advisers had hoped to avoid: an election where his top recruits fizzled or flopped and his primary Republican rival soared to new stardom.
Takeaways from the 2022 midterm elections: Battle for control of the House and Senate still up in the air
Sources familiar with the matter said Trump left the party at the end of the night in a sour mood and resentful of the attention on DeSantis, who won reelection with a monstrous margin of victory and became the first Republican governor to carry Miami-Dade County, a densely populated and diverse area, for the first time in two decades. Just hours before the Florida governor’s victory, Trump had trashed DeSantis in comments to reporters aboard his 757 plane, threatening to dish unflattering information about him and suggesting he could have been more “gracious” for Trump’s endorsement in his 2018 bid for the governor’s mansion.
“It wasn’t a great night for Trump and makes 2024 more competitive,” said one Republican operative.
By Wednesday morning, Trump was in touch with allies in early 2024 voting states as he worked to develop a message that could carry him forward, according to two people briefed on those talks. In Iowa, Trump plans to tout Republican Brenna Bird’s defeat of incumbent Democratic Attorney General Tom Miller even though he didn’t endorse Bird until November 5, three days before her election.
As he works to plot his next steps, one of the biggest questions he is grappling with is how to approach DeSantis, sources said.
Before his resounding success on Tuesday, the Florida governor “was already having a moment but the spotlight just quadrupled in intensity,” said one Trump adviser.
“We’ve got to figure out how to get it back before next Tuesday,” the Trump adviser added, referring to the “big announcement” Trump has teased for November 15, when he is expected to formally declare his third campaign for the White House. DeSantis’ strength was reflected in CNN exit polls on Tuesday, which showed the Republican governor exceeding President Joe Biden’s 2020 margin of victory among Latino voters in Florida and maintaining a small edge among independents, which Biden carried in the state by 11 points two years ago.
Both data points could prove compelling GOP primary between DeSantis and Trump, who made inroads with Black and Hispanic voters in some 2020 states but not to the degree of the Florida Republican.
Two people close to the former president said he backed himself into a corner by publicly setting a date for his expected campaign announcement before the outcome of the midterm elections was known, something he did at an Ohio campaign rally on election eve to compromise with allies who did not want him to use the event as the launch site for his campaign.
Key Trump-backed candidates have a rough night as crucial races still too early to call
“He has to [announce],” said a source close to Trump, adding that it is too late for him to back out. “It would be embarrassing.”
Another Trump ally noted it would be “less embarrassing to delay than to get out there to a bunch of silence.”
Some in Trump’s circle hoped a runoff in Georgia could help the former president delay the announcement and save face.
Trump adviser Jason Miller said that Herschel Walker – who will face Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock in a December 6 runoff, CNN projected Wednesday – should be the priority.
“I’ll be advising him to delay it until after the Georgia runoff, assuming that’s where the race is still trending,” Miller said.
Others expect that advice will fall on deaf ears. One source noted that Trump had so far been resistant to arguments that he should postpone his announcement and as of Wednesday morning, it was still unclear to some of the former president’s closest aides how he would handle his 2024 ambitions. Would he proceed defiantly – launching a campaign with disregard for the potential obstacles that lie ahead – or entertain a rare recalculation?
“I could see him claiming that Republicans didn’t turn out in droves because he wasn’t on the ballot and blaming everyone but himself,” said one of his advisers.
Desire to be a kingmaker
For Trump, Tuesday’s underwhelming results followed months of intense engagement in a midterm cycle that marked a notable departure from the post-presidential activities of his modern predecessors. As early as last summer, he began working to recruit candidates for key Senate contests who would advance his false claims about the 2020 election.
“He wanted to be seen as a legendary kingmaker,” said a former Trump campaign official.
Winners and losers from the 2022 election so far
By this spring, Trump was directly meddling in contested primaries – endorsing candidates he deemed to be the most MAGA, criticizing their opponents in statements and Truth Social posts, and patently ignoring advice from some of his advisers to remain on the sidelines until the general election began. Trump often argued that his involvement would pay dividends in the end, not only ushering in majorities in both congressional chambers but ensuring elected officials loyal to him – not the party – were installed in Washington and key governor’s mansions.
In many cases, even candidates that Trump didn’t endorse emblazoned their campaign websites with his image or familiar phrases like “America First” or “MAGA fighter.” Throughout the cycle, GOP contenders regularly trekked to Mar-a-Lago to seek his support. Others shelled out thousands of dollars to host fundraising events at the waterfront property, hoping the former president would take note of their devotion and reward them with an endorsement.
Trump ended the cycle by spending more than $16 million through his MAGA Inc. super PAC in the final weeks to boost many of his hand-picked candidates and link his top Democratic targets to Biden, who has grappled with sinking favorability during his first two years in office. Hours before results began pouring in on Tuesday, Trump’s team circulated a memo touting his “unprecedented success in 2022” that quantified his campaign trail appearances and assistance to Republican candidates.
Donald Trump said the Trumpiest thing possible about the election
“President Donald J. Trump has endorsed over 330 candidates this election cycle,” the memo read, adding that Trump has “raised nearly $350 million” for GOP candidates and the party overall since leaving office.
With votes still being tabulated in some states, it is unclear just how many of the hundreds of candidates who earned Trump’s endorsement prevailed on Tuesday. What is clear is that Trump allies entered Tuesday night believing it would be an undeniable success for the 45th president.
As he gathered with other Trump campaign alums at Mar-a-Lago on Tuesday, Miller described the former president as a “juggernaut” at the beginning of the evening.
“It will be a much different-looking party now because of the Trump MAGA movement,” Miller had predicted.
Asked about the 330 endorsements that could make or break his political future, Trump himself began the night suggesting that he should emerge on the other side of the midterms unblemished, telling NewsNation hours before polls closed, “I think if they win, I should get all the credit. If they lose, I should not be blamed at all.”

 — 
Tesla drivers will soon be able to take a video call directly from their vehicle’s touchscreen dashboard, Zoom announced Tuesday.
The video call provider announced on Tuesday during its annual Zoom (ZM)topia conference, where it typically teases new features to support remote calls, that its software is coming to Tesla (TSLA)’s built-in infotainment center. In a pre-recorded demo video shown at the event, a Tesla (TSLA) driver is seen taking a Zoom (ZM) call while recharging her vehicle.
After this story initially published, the company told CNN Business the car will need to be parked show video; when the vehicle is in motion, only audio will be enabled. The timing of the launch is still unknown, however.
The feature itself is one that Tesla has been mulling for years. In May 2020, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said in a tweet adding Zoom calls to Tesla vehicles was “definitely a future feature.” In the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic, Musk received a bevvy of tweets that requested Zoom integration; drivers argued it would give them another private space to take calls and make use of the existing driver-facing camera, present in some Teslas, and large display.
At the time, a Zoom spokesperson told pop culture website Mashable that adding support for video calls into its infotainment system would not be the safest use case because many people might attempt to use it while driving.
Zoom also unveiled at Tuesday’s event other new tools, including the integration of email and calendar services directly into the service, a conversational AI and chatbot that helps troubleshoot issues, and support for developers to monetize their apps on Zoom’s App Marketplace.
The Zoom news comes as Tesla faces growing competition in the electric vehicle market from established automakers such as Volkswagen, Ford and General Motors. Some investors have expressed concerns that Musk will be too distracted by his purchase of Twitter to give enough attention to addressing Tesla’s problems.
This week, Musk continued to sell Tesla stock for a total that now nears $4 billion since he acquired Twitter (TWTR). Tesla shares have lost 46% of their value so far this year on disappointing sales caused by supply chain problems.
Musk’s companies haven’t always had a strong relationship with Zoom. SpaceX, for example, banned its employees from using Zoom in April 2020 over “significant privacy and security concerns.”

‘The Crown’ Season 5 takes dramatic liberties, but here’s where they lean into history

Editor’s Note: This story contains some spoilers about season 5 of “The Crown.”
CNN
 — 
“The Crown” has been criticized by some for making fiction appear to be fact.
Netflix’s incredibly popular retelling of the lives of the modern day British royal family is rife with drama - too much for some people’s liking.
Season 5 debuted Wednesday and it was controversial even before it premiered.
That’s because former British Prime Minister Sir John Major complained that a scene purporting to show him and then Prince Charles (played by Dominic West) discussing a plot to oust his mother Queen Elizabeth from the throne when Major was in office was a “barrel load of malicious nonsense.”
Esteemed actress Dame Judi Dench cosigned in a letter to The Times, calling on Netflix add a disclaimer to the series.
“No one is a greater believer in artistic freedom than I, but this cannot go unchallenged,” Dench wrote. “Despite this week stating publicly that The Crown has always been a “fictionalised drama” the programme makers have resisted all calls for them to carry a disclaimer at the start of each episode.”
But the series does feature some history that is factual - even if it does have the tendency to spice things up here and there.
Here are some examples, subtle and substantive, of where the show leans into actual history.
Prince Charles and Princess Diana’s marriage misery

The series kicks off with the beloved royal couple heading off on what was supposed to be a romantic holiday, but doesn’t end up that way.
Granted we have no idea if a young Prince William and Prince Harry actually did ally with their mom over their dad on vacation activities, but the show does a pretty good job of documenting how unhappy Princess Diana and then Prince Charles were.
They cover it all - from Andrew Morton’s bombshell “Diana” book (which she cooperated on from behind the scenes) in 1996 to the utter cringe that was the leaking of then Prince Charles and his now wife Camilla’s salacious phone conversations that caused a huge controversy because of their infidelity.
One senses that as tortured as it’s portrayed on the screen, it was even worse for the couple in real life.
The fire at Windsor Castle
Imelda Staunton as Queen Elizabeth II surveys the damage of a devastating fire in ""The Crown"" Season 5
Keith Bernstein/Netflix
During the speech she made to mark her 40th anniversary on the throne, Queen Elizabeth makes a speech about the year 1992 being her “annus horribilis.”
“1992 is not a year on which I shall look back with undiluted pleasure,” she said.
One of the reasons she had such an awful year was because of a fire at Windsor Castle that destroyed more than 100 rooms.
The fire is not a major storyline, but a scene showing Imelda Staunton as Queen Elizabeth surveying the destruction seems to serve as a symbol of the troubles in her family and - by extension - her country.
The friendship between Prince Phillip and Penny Knatchbull
Jonathan Pryce as Prince Phillip and Natascha McElhone as Penny Knatchbull in Season 5 of ""The Crown.""
Keith Bernstein/Netflix
Penny Knatchbull married the godson of the Duke of Edinburgh, but her friendship with Prince Phillip was solid in a way that went beyond that.
The series features Prince Phillip stepping in to help Knatchbull after a family tragedy which leads to years of them growing closer.
She became “the second-most important woman in the Duke of Edinburgh’s life — a constant confidante, loyal companion and ‘keeper of secrets’” Ingrid Seward wrote in her 2020 book “Prince Philip Revealed.”
“The Crown” makes a point to show that the much older Prince Phillip was not romantically involved with Knatchbull, but rather bonded over their common interests like carriage riding.
That dress

Keith Bernstein/Netflix
After Prince Charles admitted during an ITN documentary in 1994 that he had not been loyal to Princess Diana, she stepped out in a black, off the shoulder Christina Stambolian dress that was dubbed “the revenge dress.”
The now iconic scene is recreated in the show by Elizabeth Debicki, who is winning raves for her portrayal of Princess Diana.

 — 
Adidas (ADDDF) ended its sneaker partnership with Ye, formerly known as Kanye West, last month after the musician’s anti-Semitic tirade. But Adidas (ADDDF) will continue to sell the lucrative sneaker and apparel line, stripped of the Yeezy name and branding.
The company said it’s the sole owner of all Yeezy line design rights for both existing and future colors and versions. Selling the sneakers under Adidas’ own branding will save the company about $300 million in royalty payments and marketing fees.
“Going forward, we will leverage the existing inventory with the exact plans being developed as we speak,” Adidas finance chief said Wednesday Harm Ohlmeyer.
The Yeezy line was a key product for Adidas and the fallout has hurt the company.
Yeezy products generated nearly $2 billion in sales last year for Adidas accounting for 8% of the company’s total sales, according to Morgan Stanley. The line also helped Adidas get shelf space at major retailers and brought new customers into the stores who purchased other Adidas merchandise.
Ending the partnership cost Adidas more than $250 million in profit and $500 million in lost revenue, the company said Wednesday.
On Tuesday, Adidas said it was appointing a new CEO, tapping the head of Puma to succeed outgoing CEO Kasper Rorsted.
Norwegian Bjørn Gulden, 57, will become CEO of Adidas next year. He will have to find ways to replace Yeezy sales and turn around the brand. Adidas’ stock has dropped around 80% the last two years.
It would be a mistake for Adidas to continue selling the line, said Darcey Jupp, an apparel analyst at GlobalData.
“It should refrain from relaunching items under its own brand, as they will always be synonymous with West, and this would likely result in muted customer demand,” he said in a note to clients.

Sleep deprivation affects nearly half of American adults, study finds

CNN
 — 
Americans are failing In their endless quest for adequate slumber, leading to deficits that can impact health, according to a new study on sleep habits in the United States.
Permanent Daylight Saving Time will hurt our health, experts say
The study, which authors called the the first to separately evaluate sleep duration between workdays and free days, analyzed sleep data on over 9,000 Americans age 20 and older collected by the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey between 2017 and March 2020.
Almost 30% of respondents had trouble falling or staying asleep and about 27% were very sleepy during the day, according to the study published Tuesday in the journal JAMA Network Open.
The analysis also found over 30% of adults reported an hour of sleep debt -— when you sleep less than your body needs — while nearly 1 in 10 adults had a sleep debt of two hours or more.
Adults over 18 need at least 7 hours of solid sleep at night to be healthy, according to the US Centers of Disease Control and Prevention. Sleep debt, along with irregular sleep duration, has been linked to an increased risk of obesity, heart disease, dementia and mood disorders such as anxiety and depression.
“This is a well done study examining a very large and representative sample,” said Dr. Bhanu Prakash Kolla, a sleep medicine specialist in the Center for Sleep Medicine at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota.
“At least a quarter of the population complained of daytime sleepiness and difficulties with sleep,” said Kolla, who was not involved in the study.
Social jet lag
In addition, nearly half of the adults in the study reported social jet lag – a bad fit between the sleep timing preferred by a person’s inner biological clock and the one dictated by society.
A TikTok trend about mouth taping while you sleep can be dangerous
“The timing of your sleep on workdays is the societal and work constraints, but the timing of your sleep on free days is what your body clock really wants you to do,” said Dr. Elizabeth Klerman, a professor of neurology in the division of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School in Boston.
If you have a big difference between the two, “it’s like you’re living in a state of jet lag during the work week,” said Klerman, who was not involved in the study.
Over 46% of the survey participants reported at least 1 hour of social jet lag, while 19.3% experienced at least 2 hours.
“With strict work schedules and jam-packed weekend activities, it’s not surprising that many individuals report that their sleep needs are not being met during the week,” said sleep specialist Dr. Raj Dasgupta, a clinical associate professor of medicine at the University of Southern California’s Keck School of Medicine. He was not involved in the study.
Untreated social jet lag can have serious consequences, including insomnia, early waking or excessive sleepiness, daytime fatigue, difficulty concentrating, constipation or diarrhea and increased cortisol levels. It may also play a role in the development of obesity, type 2 diabetes and heart disease.
Can you change from a night owl to an early bird? Here's what sleep experts think
A June 2021 study analyzed the sleep habits of 85,000 people in the UK and found those people with a misaligned sleep cycle were more likely to report depression, anxiety and have fewer feelings of wellbeing.
While the JAMA study did not examine if people preferred mornings or evenings, it is the “night owls” who prefer to stay up late that will suffer most, Kolla said: “These are the folk who are likely going to have more of a sleep debt and more social jet lag due to this mismatch between their internal body clock and current work requirements.”
How to get better sleep
To overcome sleep deficits and social lag, experts suggest backtiming your bedtime from your morning alarm. If you need to be up by 6 a.m., you’d want to go to sleep by 11 p.m. to get the recommended seven hours of shuteye needed to refresh your body.
Tips to help with falling asleep quickly include meditation, deep breathing and progressive muscle relaxation. Then, to keep your internal clock running smoothly, it’s also best to keep to the same schedule on non-work days.
How to get to sleep the night before an early call or big event
“You should try and have the same sleep and wake times on weekdays and non-work days,” Klerman said. “But if you aren’t getting enough sleep during the work week, you should try and get more on your free days.”
Research over the last few years is finding “catch-up sleep” is helpful, she said: “For example, a 2020 study found adults who caught up on sleep on their free days were less likely to show higher inflammation levels.” Inflammation is a key contributor to chronic disease.
A 2019 study that followed almost 44,000 people for 13 years found that for people under 65 sleep of less than 5 hours on free days was associated with a 52% higher premature death rate. However, longer sleep of about 9 hours on off-days was not.
One 2017 study of Korean adults found that catchup sleep on free days may be linked to lower weight, while another 2017 study found sleeping an additional hour on non-work days also helped control blood sugars.
Adults need at least seven hours of restful sleep a night for good health, the CDC says.
Other tips to counter sleep deficits include exercising, avoiding naps and practicing good sleep hygiene, such as avoiding coffee in the afternoon and alcohol at night, keeping smartphones and other electronic devices out of the bedroom and taking a warm bath or relaxing with yoga.
Then, when you get up in the morning, “don’t hit that snooze button,” Dasgupta said. “Try your best to get out of bed when your alarm goes off and try to get outside; especially if the weather is good and there is a lot of sunshine in the morning. This will allow suppression of melatonin and reset that circadian rhythm.”

After Hillary lost, she went for a walk in the woods, wrote books, did podcasts & traveled the world advocating for human rights & democracy at large.
She didn’t once call for the Constitution to be terminated.

Lagos, Nigeria
""Wakanda Forever,"" the sequel to ""Black Panther,"" Marvel Studios' award-winning $1.3 billion grossing movie, had its African premiere in Nigeria -- the first time Marvel has held an African premiere there.
Attending the event in Lagos, on Sunday, November 6, the film's director, Ryan Coogler, and several leading actors spoke to CNN about the importance of celebrating the film in Africa's most populous country, and how they hope the continued exploration of different cultures and history will impact global audiences.
The film follows the death in 2020 of Chadwick Boseman, who played King T'Challa -- the Black Panther -- in the original movie, released in 2018.
'Black Panther: Wakanda Forever' pulls off a difficult dive after Chadwick Boseman's death
With the introduction of new anti-hero Namor, the king of underwater kingdom Talokan, who breaches Wakanda's defenses while the country is still grieving the loss of T'Challa, ""Wakanda Forever"" presents another mythical and powerful nation, -- this time with roots in Mayan culture.
Coogler, who also co-wrote the script, said that introducing another rich heritage was on the cards when he started developing the idea of the sequel in 2018. ""We wanted to ramp it up by making it more culturally specific, more detailed, more personal. And even after Chadwick passed away, we stayed the course. I was speaking with him before he passed and he was excited about the direction that the film was going in,"" said Coogler.
""Our diversity is our strength""
The 2018 film was one of the highest grossing films in Africa, with audiences responding favorably to the kingdom of Wakanda, which represented an amalgam of African countries and cultures and an ideology of an Africa many would like to see.
Lupita Nyong'o, the Kenyan-Mexican actress who plays Wakandan spy Nakia, told CNN she hopes global audiences will connect with the diversity showcased in the movie. ""There is power in a diverse human experience,"" she said. ""I think it's always good to be able to relate to people who do not look like you and to see your humanity in them. Our diversity is our strength as human beings.""

Nyong'o and her co-star, Zimbabwean-American actress and writer Danai Gurira, attended the Black Panther premiere in South Africa in 2018, and to them, having more of the cast come to the continent they call home is significant. ""There's always a comfort coming back to the continent. We are very different around Africa, but there's also a through line there,"" said Nyong'o. ""There's just something that feels more familiar, more accessible and I love that.""
The film's score and soundtrack also celebrates the cultures championed in the movie, featuring a mix of Latin American and African artists such as Grammy-winning Nigerian artist Burna Boy, Ghana's Amaarae, UK artist Stormzy, whose mother is Ghanaian, and Grammy-nominated Nigerian singer-songwriter Tems, who co-wrote the lead single ""Lift me up,"" sung by Rihanna. The soundtrack was recorded in Nigeria, Mexico and London.
How 'The Woman King' created a warm and epic Dahomey Kingdom for the big screen
Gurira, who reprises her role as General Okoye, the leader of the Dora Milaje, Wakanda's all-female army, said of the premiere: ""This feels like massive progress that so many of us are here this time. I'm very excited to be here and I think it is different from being in the US or in the West because the story is so rooted in the continent that the idea of it being celebrated here in a big way is only right.""
Also in attendance were actors Winston Duke, who plays M'baku, leader of the Jabari Tribe, Letitia Wright, who plays tech-whiz Princess Shuri, and Tenoch Huerta as Namor. The premiere was one of the opening films at the African International Film Festival (AFRIFF), which runs until 12 November.
""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" is released in theaters worldwide on November 11.

 — 
Changes are coming for Wordle … again.
For starters the New York Times (NYT) this week named Tracy Bennett the new editor of Wordle, the wildly popular online puzzle game that gives players six chances to guess a five-letter word daily.
With an editor in place, the Times said that the game is shifting away from the preselected words of Josh Wardle, the puzzle’s creator. It will, instead, include words that the New York Times has chosen.
Also changing: The answer will never be a plural that ends in “s” or “es.” However, you can guess plural words to help you eliminate possible words.
“Wordle’s gameplay will stay the same, and answers will be drawn from the same basic dictionary of answer words, with some editorial adjustments to ensure that the game stays focused on vocabulary that’s fun, accessible, lively and varied,” Everdeen Mason, the Times’ editorial director of games, said on Monday.
Wordle and your brain: Does playing make you smarter?
Mason added that “while the answer list is curated, the much larger dictionary of English words that are valid guesses will not be curated. What solvers choose to use as guess words is their private choice.”
The Times bought Wordle for “low seven figures” earlier this year. It’s a part of the Times’ portfolio of online games that includes the Crossword and Spelling Bee.
Wordle, which was turned into a board game in July, has been a huge success for the news company, helping boost the number of digital subscriptions for the newspaper.
“Wordle brought an unprecedented tens of millions of new users to the Times, many of whom stayed to play other games which drove our best quarter ever for net subscriber additions to Games,” said CEO Meredith Kopit Levien in the earnings release from May.

Getting laid off? Know your rights
By Jeanne Sahadi, CNN Business
Updated 10:42 AM EST, Tue November 8, 2022

The abrupt and unceremonious way that thousands of Twitter employees got laid off last week was a spectacle.
But it was also a helpful reminder that while employers can get rid of many workers at will (and with zero graciousness), employees are not without rights when they are laid off en masse.
Here’s a quick primer on what employees need to know.
How much advance notice should I get?
For a plant closing or a mass layoff, you should get at least 60 days notice, under the federal Worker Adjustment Retraining Notification (WARN) Act. Some states may require more notice – New York, for instance, requires 90 days. And states also may set stricter standards than the federal law, such as requiring employers with fewer workers to comply with the WARN Act.
If an employer is found to have violated the WARN Act, in addition to paying penalties to the state, it will be required to pay out up to 60 days (or more, depending on the state requirement) of back wages and benefits to those laid off, depending on how many days’ notice the company actually gave.
“Notice” in this instance means notifying the community at large but also each individual who will be laid off, said employment attorney Michael DuPont, who is managing shareholder at the Minnesota-based law firm Wagner, Falconer & Judd and also provides legal services through LegalShield.
If a company lays you off abruptly, it may be found to have complied with the WARN Act so long as the effective date of your layoff is at least 60 days after the day you got notice that you’re being let go, said employment attorney Alex Granovsky, cofounder of the New York-based law firm Granovsky & Sundaresh.
Technically you will remain on the company’s payroll and will continue to receive pay and benefits in the interim, and then any severance you’re given would kick in.
How much severance am I entitled to?
Un-fun fact: No law – federal or state – requires employers to offer you any severance when they lay you off, unless you have a union or individual employment contract that includes a provision for it.
That said, many employers do offer some form of severance to protect themselves from any potential legal claims you might bring as a result of your employment or termination.
A second reason many offer severance: “Good will and fairness to the employees and to the community as a whole. To offer additional compensation in recognition of the potentially tough time the employee and community would [experience],” DuPont said.
What do I give up in exchange for accepting severance?
An employer will want you to waive certain rights in exchange for money.
Put bluntly, “the company covers itself in every way a former employee can hurt [it],” Granovsky said.
Generally speaking you will waive your right to bring a claim against the company, such as discrimination, hostile work environment, pay violations or any other alleged wrongdoing.
You also typically will need to agree to several clauses that prohibit you from harming the company, he said. They include:
A confidentiality clause: This clause prohibits you from sharing details of the company’s business or even the terms of your severance agreement.
A non-disparagement clause: This prohibits you from badmouthing the place.
A cooperation clause: You agree to assist the company if it gets sued in the future over a matter that you know something about as a result of your tenure there.
A non-cooperation clause: This prohibits you from helping anyone else trying to sue the company.
A non-solicitation clause: This typically means you can’t poach your soon-to-be former employer’s clients or employees should you start working elsewhere or launch your own business.
Waiving these types of rights does not, however, excuse the employer from having to pay you what is already owed, such as a pension or earned vacation or sick leave. “The consideration offered for the waiver of the right to sue … must be something of value in addition to any of the employee’s existing entitlements,” the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) notes.
Can I negotiate the terms of the severance?
If you think you have legitimate claims against the company, your employer would almost certainly rather you not sue, so it will likely be more open to negotiating the terms of your severance instead.
“A company would rather pay $100 now to avoid having to pay $150 later,” DuPont said.
If you don’t have a strong case that could justify filing a lawsuit, which you could use as a bargaining chip, you can still try to make the case for why your employer might sweeten your severance package.
“Asking is fine. You should ask. There’s no harm in asking,” Granovsky said.
You might ask for more months of paid health benefits if you or a family member on your insurance plan is battling cancer, DuPont noted as an example. Or if you’re a long-term employee in good standing or you have a special skill set that the employer might want to tap in the future, you might make a compelling case for why the company should offer you some additional pay.
Should I hire a lawyer?
Since a severance agreement is an important legal document that will affect your immediate future, it can be helpful to have an employment lawyer with experience in severance cases review the company’s offer.
If hiring a lawyer directly is too expensive, you might consider a less expensive service like LegalShield, which only charges about $30 a month to gain access to an employment attorney in your state who can review your offer, make sure it complies with the law and make a call on your behalf to your employer if you’re seeking modifications to the agreement.
If your case is complicated and involves further legal action, or if your severance agreement is more than 15 pages long, your costs will be higher, but you will get a discount on the hourly fees of the lawyer on your case.
Or, if you just have some very simple questions, some employment lawyers might offer a free consultation by phone.
How long will I have to decide whether to accept a severance package?
Under federal laws, if you’re 40 or older, you must be given at least 45 days in a group termination (21 days if your layoff is not part of a mass layoff) to decide whether to sign your severance agreement.
In either case, if you accept the offer you also must be given a 7-day period afterward to change your mind.
That said, each state may have its own requirements above the federal minimum requirements, DuPont said. So check your state’s Department of Labor site to see what its specific requirements are.
Will I lose my severance if I start earning income again?
Many employers may stop your severance payments if the company rehires you for a new position.
If you find a job elsewhere or start freelancing for others, some employers may choose to reduce your severance payments if your new source of income is less than what you used to be paid.
“They may say, ‘If you make less money we’ll only pay the delta,’” Granovsky said.
In either case, your severance agreement should state explicitly what the employer’s policy is. So don’t sign it until you’re clear about those terms.
But if the agreement is silent on the issue then you likely may continue to receive your full severance while also earning income from another source. “So that’s a win for the employee,” DuPont said.

When stress is coming at you from all sides, it’s time for a breather. Here are 6 ways to take a break
By Dana Santas, CNN
Updated 7:26 AM EST, Wed November 9, 2022

Optimize your breathing with these tips

Editor’s Note: Dana Santas, known as the “Mobility Maker,” is a certified strength and conditioning specialist and mind-body coach in professional sports, and is the author of “Practical Solutions for Back Pain Relief.”
CNN
 — 
Stressful situations are a part of everyday life, but it can be a challenge managing the daily grind without feeling the heat. Whether you’re stuck in traffic or in an anxiety-inducing thought pattern, your body’s stress response naturally kicks in — breathing becomes rapid, your heart races, and blood pressure rises.
Breathe better to live better: Why breathing is your superpower
If you’re focused on the source of stress, you may be less conscious of the physiological impact, so you don’t take action to reverse it. This unawareness, unfortunately, leads to prolonged states of stress. Left unchecked, chronic stress can affect your health and relationships, and has been linked to serious conditions such as hypertension, anxiety disorders and addiction, according to the Yale Stress Center in New Haven, Connecticut.
The good news is that you can build in stress-relieving “breathing breaks” throughout the day to break the stress cycle and restore calm. Simply make it a point to step away from your daily activities for a few minutes every couple of hours and focus on your breathing.
If you’re old enough, you might remember decades ago — before the mountains of research on smoking’s harmful effects — when stepping outside to smoke was considered an acceptable work break. Why not institute breathing breaks instead?
Take a break from your daily activities and focus on your breathing to relieve stress and restore calm.
Aaron Lockwood
Unlike smoke breaks, breathing breaks are actually good for you! And breathing is one of the most effective ways to manage stress because it leverages your own physiology and requires no special tools. In as little as 90 seconds, deep breathing stimulates a physiological relaxation response that inhibits stress hormone production, lowers blood pressure and decreases heart rate, according to research.
Try incorporating the breathing exercises below into your own breaks to relieve stress and restore calm. It’s important to inhale through your nose, if possible, but you can exhale out of your nose or mouth, based on your comfort level. Unless otherwise noted in the instructions, perform the breathing exercises for about eight to 10 breaths, which equates to anywhere from two to three minutes — perfect timing for a breathing break.
Present-moment breathing
Breathe your way to better sleep and overall recovery
This is a great starter exercise for anyone new to breathing techniques. There are no special instructions aside from keeping your mind focused on your breathing. From any position, wherever you are, begin lengthening and deepening your breath. While you do so, focus all your attention on the sounds and sensations of your breathing. Feel the expansion and contraction of your rib cage. Direct all your senses to follow the path of air in through your nose, down your throat, into your lungs and out again. Listen to the sound of your breath. If your mind wanders, bring it back to your breathing, which is always happening in the present moment.
Box breathing
How to tell if your stress levels are normal or the sign of something more
This exercise is aptly named because the four phases of each breath (inhale, pause, exhale, pause) are done at an even count, like the four even sides of a box. You can practice this at a variety of different breath lengths. Four is a popular count, but if you feel comfortable extending your breath to five or six, go for it.
Example of box breathing at a four-count:
Inhale for a count of four.
Pause, holding your breath for a count of four.
Exhale for a count of four.
Pause without breathing for a count of four.
5-7-3 breathing

This breathing technique simply follows a 5-7-3 pattern of inhaling for a count of five, exhaling for a count of seven and pausing after the exhale for a count of three. You can follow along with this video for more detailed instruction.
4-7-8 breathing
The 4-7-8 method that could help you sleep
The 4-7-8 breathing exercise is a relaxing yogic-style technique, popularized by Dr. Andrew Weil in 2015. Like the 5-7-3 and box breathing exercises, it follows a specific pattern. To practice it, you breathe in for four counts, hold your breath for seven counts and then exhale for eight counts.
Peace-pause breathing
With this exercise, you’ll want to close your eyes so you can visualize spelling out the word “peace.” Lengthen and deepen your breathing to follow this pace:
Inhale for a count of five.
Exhale for a count of seven.
After exhaling, pause for a count of five.
Once you establish the pattern, begin spelling out P-E-A-C-E in your mind during the five-count pause.
Alternate nostril breathing
Alternate nostril breathing is a yogic style of breathing that has been specifically shown in research to help ease anxiety.
Start off the alternate nostril breathing exercise by using your right thumb to close off the right nostril.
Aaron Lockwood
To practice, sit comfortably, resting your left hand in your lap. Fold down the middle three fingers of your right hand, leaving your thumb and pinky extended. Traditional yoga has you leave your ring finger extended as well, but I have found it’s difficult for many people to hold that hand position comfortably, so I cue extending the thumb and pinky only.
Use your right thumb to close off the right nostril.
Inhale slowly through your left nostril at a pace that feels right for you.
Close off your left nostril with your pinky, releasing your thumb off your right nostril.
Then use your pinky to close off your left nostril while releasing your thumb off your right nostril.
Aaron Lockwood
Exhale through your right nostril at a comfortable pace.
Inhale through the right nostril.
Use your thumb to close off the right nostril.
Exhale through the left nostril.
The directions above are for one round of two breaths. Try five rounds to start, gradually building up to more, if desired.

After trying the exercises above, decide which ones work best for you and begin doing them consistently as part of your own prescribed breathing breaks. It’s also good to practice them anytime you feel stressed and need to reconnect to a sense of calm in the present moment.
With regular focus on your breathing, you should start to notice that your overall breathing rate begins to slow and that you are less reactive to stressors.

Why these five states don’t sell lottery tickets
By Nathaniel Meyersohn, CNN Business

Inside the secure world of choosing Powerball millionaires
01:21 - Source: CNN
New York
CNN Business
 — 
If residents of Alabama, Utah, Alaska, Hawaii or Nevada wanted a chance to win this week’s record Powerball jackpot, they had to travel to another state to buy a ticket.
These five states do not offer government-operated lotteries or participate in interstate drawings with rollover jackpots such as Powerball or Mega Millions. They are the last remaining lottery holdouts in America.
Since 1964, when New Hampshire became the first to offer a state lottery, 44 states have started their own or joined multi-state jackpots. (Mississippi was the most recent state to add lotto games in 2019.)
States, often under budget pressures, introduced lotteries as a way to add revenue without raising taxes. They found willing partners in gambling companies that benefit from running lottery games.
More than 200,000 retail stores and other outlets in the United States sell lottery tickets. In 2019, lottery sales topped $91 billion, according to the North American Association of State and Provincial Lotteries.
Powerball used to have a jackpot limit. Then it exploded
But the five holdouts have a number of reasons why they haven’t joined the rest of the country in adopting state lotteries.
Alabama and Utah prohibit gambling in their state constitutions, and religious groups in these conservative states have for years blocked efforts to legalize casinos or adopt lotteries.
Utah, where more than 60% of the the state’s population are members of the Church of Latter Day Saints, has long opposed a lottery.
Efforts to add a lottery have gained strength in Alabama, however, and the state could be getting closer to adopting one.
“Alabama has been trying to pass a lottery since the election of Don Siegelman as governor in 1998. Churches helped defeat a lottery referendum the following year,” said Jonathan D. Cohen, author of “For a Dollar and a Dream: State Lotteries in Modern America.”
Now, 24 years later, “I think they might be serious this time, as Mississippi finally got its lottery act together,” he said.
In Nevada’s case, public lotteries have been blocked by the powerful casino industry, which views sales of lotto tickets in convenience and grocery stores as competition — even though many stores have slot machines instead of lottery tickets.
In the past, pressure to add lotteries has often come from neighboring states. That’s because when one state adds a lottery, people often flood across state lines to buy tickets. The holdout state then has an incentive to keep the revenue from ticket purchases in its own state.
Hawaii and Alaska, of course, don’t have any US neighbors and don’t face this problem.
“That allows them to not have a lottery without people going across the border,” said Victor Matheson, a professor of economics and accounting at College of the Holy Cross who studies lotteries.
Concerns that lower-income households spend a disproportionate share of their incomes on lotteries compared to wealthier households have also blocked lottery expansion.
“A lot of states have been reluctant to start lotteries in the first place,” Matheson said. “They are worried about their regressive nature and gambling addiction.”
An investigation of state lotteries by the Howard Center for Investigative Journalism found that in every state where lotteries are legal, stores that sell tickets are disproportionately clustered in lower-income communities. And far more money is wagered every year on instant scratch-off games, which studies show attract more low-income gamblers, than huge jackpot drawings such as Powerball.
Recently, states that have adopted lotteries have emphasized that sales from tickets will go to social programs.
But lotteries are a “really unwise way to fund education and other public services,” said David Just, a professor of economics at Cornell University who has studied behavioral decisions around lottery tickets. The people likeliest to buy tickets are often the same ones who most rely on these government programs, he said.

Newt Gingrich ordered to testify before Georgia grand jury investigating 2020 election aftermath
By Sara Murray, CNN

 — 
Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich must testify before the Atlanta-area special grand jury investigating efforts by Donald Trump and his allies to overturn the 2020 election in Georgia, a Virginia judge ordered Wednesday.
Fairfax Circuit Court Judge Robert Smith ordered Gingrich to appear before the grand jury on November 29.
Because Gingrich is an out-of-state witness and resides in Virginia, the Virginia court was tasked with whether to issue and enforce the subpoena from Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, who is leading the election interference probe in Georgia.
An attorney for the former Republican speaker said he is likely to appeal.
Supreme Court rejects Lindsey Graham's request to block Georgia grand jury subpoena
Prosecutors are interested in hearing from Gingrich about his role working with Trump’s campaign after the 2020 election, including the scheme to send “fake electorate” certificates to the National Archives and encouraging the then-president’s campaign “to air advertisements promoting the false narrative that election workers had smuggled suitcases containing fake ballots at the State Farm Arena in Atlanta,” according to court filings.
In issuing the subpoena, Georgia prosecutors cited information from a letter the House Select Committee investigating January 6 issued seeking Gingrich’s testimony. Gingrich’s attorney, John Burlingame, argued in court that Gingrich already plans to testify before the House committee on November 21 and should not be forced to appear in Georgia as well.
“It’s not necessary for Speaker Gingrich to have to travel to Georgia to address the exact same topics,” Burlingame argued.
The judge, however, disagreed.
The Atlanta-area grand jury has also subpoenaed Randy Evans, who is one of Gingrich’s attorneys, to testify. Evans said prosecutors want to ask him about correspondence Gingrich sent that includes mention of Evans.
Evans told CNN he plans to comply with the subpoena and testify on Thursday.

Kevin McCarthy moves quickly to secure potential speakership as hard-right group weighs a long-shot challenge

 — 
House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy is moving swiftly to lock down the votes to claim the speaker’s gavel as a hard-right faction of his conference discusses whether to mount a long-shot challenge to complicate his bid and force concessions in the process, according to multiple GOP sources.
McCarthy privately spoke to his closest advisers and confidantes in a Wednesday morning phone call just hours after his party appeared on track to take the House but fell short of their bullish expectations of a massive GOP landslide. The California Republican tapped a group of members to be on his whip team that will help him secure the 218 votes in order to win the speakership in January, with GOP lawmakers on the call promising to “work hard to get him elected,” according to a source familiar with the matter. And several allies were seen popping in and out of McCarthy’s office on Wednesday as they started to hash out and execute their game plan.
“Yes,” McCarthy said confidently Wednesday night as he left the Capitol and was asked if he had the votes to assume the speakership.
But McCarthy’s easy ascension to the speakership will be determined in large part by the size of a potential GOP majority. If McCarthy maintains a narrow majority, then the pro-Trump House Freedom Caucus could stand in the way of his leadership ambitions. CNN has not yet projected a Republican takeover of the chamber.
A source familiar with the House Freedom Caucus’ deliberations told CNN on Wednesday morning that there are around two dozen current and incoming members who are willing to vote against McCarthy if he doesn’t offer them concessions. They are actively discussing putting up a nominal challenger to face McCarthy in next week’s leadership elections in an effort to force the GOP leader to give them more influence in how the House operates, the source said.
McCarthy, who sent a letter to the conference Wednesday afternoon officially declaring his bid for the speakership and asking members for their support, spoke with some potential GOP holdouts behind closed doors throughout the day, including Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, the controversial conservative who was booted from her committee assignments by Democrats – and a number of Republicans – over her past incendiary rhetoric. Greene has pushed for a spot on the powerful House Oversight Committee in a GOP majority.
Leaving McCarthy’s office, Greene would not say if she’d get what she’s been seeking.
“No comment,” Greene said when asked if she’d support McCarthy for speaker.
Next week’s leadership election is just the first step in the process. McCarthy would need to win a majority of his conference’s support next week to be nominated for speaker before a January vote when he would need 218 votes of the full House to win the gavel. The hope, the source said, is that if they back a challenger to McCarthy in next week’s elections, it would force the California Republican to cut a deal in order to secure their support in the January speaker’s race when he wouldn’t be able to afford to lose more than a handful of GOP votes in a narrow Republican majority.
Winners and losers from the 2022 election so far
The Freedom Caucus’ strategy will come into sharper focus by week’s end as members weigh their options and as incoming lawmakers come to Washington for initial meetings. Rep. Matt Gaetz, an unabashed McCarthy critic who is not a member of the Freedom Caucus but is closely aligned with the group, also started calling members to talk strategy about the speaker’s race, according to a source familiar.
Among their demands: Making it easier for individual members to call for a vote ousting a sitting speaker, an idea that McCarthy has long rejected and one that was wielded over former Speaker John Boehner, a Republican from Ohio. The same source said that the Freedom Caucus wants more representation on the panel that makes selections on members’ committee assignments. They are also calling on GOP leaders to commit to slowing down the legislative process and give them more time to review even non-controversial bills.
Hardliners may also push for promises related to launching investigations and impeachment proceedings into President Joe Biden or members of his Cabinet.
Rep. Andy Biggs, an Arizona Republican and former chairman of the Freedom Caucus, told a right-wing streaming network that a McCarthy speakership should not be a “foregone conclusion,” complaining that a red wave never materialized and accusing McCarthy of “backpedaling” on impeachment.
“McCarthy has a lot of chips to cash in,” said a senior GOP source. “But he’s gonna have to cash in every single one of them.”
McCarthy could also win over detectors with plum committee assignments, lush office space and other perks. Prior to Tuesday, there was also talk of adding an extra leadership position to his team, which could also be used to woo critics.
McCarthy allies are touting his Tuesday endorsement from former President Donald Trump for the speaker’s gavel, something that could help with staunch Trump backers in the House GOP conference. Moreover, McCarthy has long moved to develop a good standing with even the most rebellious forces within the Freedom Caucus and has been in talks with some members of the group about their role in a GOP majority for weeks, according to Republican sources.
Plus, McCarthy allies believe Republicans will credit him for the hundreds of millions of dollars that his outside group raised and spent in key races. McCarthy has been calling victorious GOP candidates and members since Tuesday night.
McCarthy’s pitch to members, according to a source familiar, has been relatively straight forward: the GOP picked up seats two cycles in a row under his watch, and he is on the verge of delivering Republicans the majority – which will arm them subpoena power and allow them to serve as a check on the Biden administration.
While McCarthy’s allies say the GOP leader is willing to hear members out, they believe negotiating with members could become a slippery slope – though McCarthy may have no choice, depending on the margins.
McCarthy had hoped to pick up at least 20 seats to give him a cushion in both the speaker’s race and to help push through his agenda. It’s unclear if they can get there as many races remain too early for CNN to call.
Other leadership races in flux
Aside from the speaker’s race, Tuesday’s underwhelming performance for the GOP has scrambled other leadership races.
The race for House GOP whip – a position that will only open up if Republicans win the majority – was already competitive, though Rep. Tom Emmer, who chairs the House GOP’s campaign arm, was seen as having the edge since he was likely to be rewarded if they had a strong night.
Now, Republicans say it could be tougher for Emmer to pull out a win.
Emmer told reporters Tuesday he still plans to run and that he doesn’t know if a smaller majority impacts his bid. But his pitch to members is similar to McCarthy’s, saying: “we delivered.”
Meanwhile, Rep. Jim Banks of Indiana, a Trump ally and the head of the conservative Republican Study Committee, also officially declared his candidacy for the whip’s position. And Rep. Drew Ferguson of Georgia, the current deputy whip, is also vying for the post, arguing that his experience on the whip’s team will be even more valuable in a slimmer majority, where the chief vote counting job will be crucial for governing.

Magic wall: See where we are in undecided Senate races02:11
2022 midterm election results
By Adrienne Vogt, Aditi Sangal, Mike Hayes, Elise Hammond, Maureen Chowdhury, Tara Subramaniam, Melissa Macaya and Meg Wagner, CNN
Updated 11:29 PM ET, Fri November 11, 2022
What we're covering here
Control of the Senate and House still in the balance: All eyes are on undecided Arizona and Nevada Senate races, as Georgia's contest heads to a Dec. 6 runoff. At least 400,000 votes remain to be counted in Arizona's Maricopa County alone, officials said.
Democrats flip key Senate seat: Democrat John Fetterman flipped Pennsylvania's Senate seat, CNN projected, boosting Democratic hopes of keeping their majority. Both parties now need two seats to win control of the Senate.
Biden addresses the country: President Biden called the midterms a ""good day for America,"" noting that the ""giant red wave"" that was predicted didn't happen and that it's still possible that Democrats hold the House.
Historic firsts: Both parties are diversifying their ranks. Here's a look at the candidates CNN projects will make history.

400,000 votes left to be counted in Maricopa County, official says

There are about 400,000 votes left to be counted in Arizona's Maricopa County, Board of Supervisors Chair Bill Gates said in a press conference Wednesday morning. This is up 100,000 votes from what Gates told CNN earlier this morning.
About 275,000 early ballots were dropped off on Election Day, Maricopa County Recorder Stephen Richer said. The election officials will need additional time to sort, count and verify the ballots. They are asking for patience as they work through the process and said they expect more than 95% of the votes will be counted by Friday. 
“This number is immense,” Richer said, adding there were about 170,000 early ballots dropped off on Election Day in 2020. 
They received 86,000 early ballots Friday and over the weekend, Richer said. Those ballots have already been processed and should be reported today, he said.
There are about 17,000 uncounted ballots that went into what they call “Box 3,” which means they were not run through the tabulator. These in-person ballots make up about 7% of in-person ballots, Gates said. There are always ballots that go into “Box 3,” Gates said, “but this is a higher percentage than normal.” Gates said those ballots are “secure” and will be tabulated in their central count facility.
Almost 1.2 million votes have already been reported, Gates said.

Rupert Murdoch's conservative media empire celebrates DeSantis's win
From CNN's Oliver Darcy

Rupert Murdoch, the media mogul who controls some of the most powerful organs in conservative media, appeared to make clear Wednesday that he would prefer to cast aside former President Donald Trump in favor of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis as the leader of the Republican party.
The New York Post, a tabloid Murdoch controls, hailed DeSantis' election night victory on its front page Wednesday morning. 
""DeFUTURE,"" the headline on the Post blared, alongside a photo of DeSantis and his family celebrating their major win in the Sunshine State.
On Fox News, the dominant television voice Murdoch controls, significant attention was given on Wednesday to DeSantis' victory. 
""I think Gov. DeSantis is the single biggest winner of the night,"" former House Speaker Newt Gingrich said on ""Fox & Friends,"" adding that he will ""almost certainly become the rallying point for everybody in the Republican Party who wants to move beyond President Trump.""
The homepage of Fox News also prominently featured a column by conservative commentator Liz Peek that declared DeSantis ""the new leader of the Republican Party."" Fox News dubbed it ""A NEW ERA.""
And at The Wall Street Journal, the broadsheet owned by Murdoch, the newspaper's conservative editorial board published a piece proclaiming the ""DeSantis Florida tsunami.""
""There’s little doubt that his Florida success will grab the attention of voters outside the Sunshine State,"" the editorial board wrote. ""You can bet Donald J. Trump was watching—unhappily.""
Coverage from Murdoch's media outlets is notable, given that they have significant sway over the Republican Party base and its power brokers.
""It is not an accident,"" a person familiar with how Murdoch runs the companies told CNN Wednesday morning when asked about the fact that the billionaire's media outlets were focusing attention on DeSantis as the future of the Republican Party.
The coverage from Murdoch's media outlets does not mean that they will completely turn on Trump. Rather, it suggests that Murdoch might use his influence to tilt the scales and push Republicans toward DeSantis if the two squared off in a 2024 Republican primary.
A spokesperson for Murdoch did not immediately return a request for comment. But Murdoch has in the past made clear his frustrations with Trump. 
Maggie Haberman, a reporter at The New York Times and CNN political analyst, reported recently in her bestselling book that after the 2020 election Murdoch remarked of Trump, ""We should throw this guy over.""

Biden will hold a press conference at 4 p.m. ET, White House says
From CNN's Betsy Klein
President Biden is set to continue the tradition of holding a formal press conference the day after the midterm elections and will take questions from reporters at 4 p.m. ET in the State Dining Room, the White House announced. 
“In the afternoon, the President will deliver remarks and take questions,” the White House said in an update to the President’s daily schedule Wednesday. 
The event will be open to press.
CNN’s MJ Lee reported Biden is expected to take a victory lap and argue that his party was able to avoid a bloodbath because at the end of the day, candidates were running on his agenda that proved to be popular. Biden will also continue to stand by the decision – which the White House was widely criticized for in the final weeks – to spend time and energy discussing issues like abortion rights, protecting democracy and election integrity, in addition to the economy and inflation. 
Biden advisers point to exit polls and ballot initiatives as clear proof that those other issues needed up being hugely motivating for voters.
Past presidents have traditionally held press conferences the day after midterm elections. They have produced noteworthy moments, like when then-President Barack Obama acknowledged a ""shellacking"" for Democrats in 2010. 
Obama held press conferences following midterm elections in 2010 and 2014. Former President Donald Trump held a press conference after midterms in 2018. And former President George W. Bush held press conferences after the midterm elections in 2002 and 2006.
“You're going to hear from the President. He always enjoys taking your questions,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters earlier this week.

Republican Lawler won ""fair and square,"" Maloney says in concession speech
From CNN's Gregory Krieg

New York Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney, the leader of the House Democratic campaign arm, publicly conceded his race to Republican Mike Lawler in a Wednesday morning press conference, saying Lawler “won fair and square” and pledging his support to man who will replace him in Congress.
CNN has not yet projected a winner in this race.
Maloney was in the awkward position of touting House Democrats’ exceeding of pre-election expectations while also trying to make sense of his own defeat, which was part of Republican near-sweep of the New York City suburbs.
“I don't like to lose. But my opponent won this race, and he won fair and square. And that means something,�� Maloney said. “I'm not going to whine about it. I'm going to do this the right way and the right thing to do is to say the other guy won, to wish him well and to pledge my support,” he added.
Maloney said he spoke to President Biden earlier and “expressed our appreciation for his leadership on the issues that matter to the American people.”
In recounting his conversation with Biden, Maloney said the president was “interested in where we end up.” Republicans appear likely to win a House majority, but the margin remains very much in doubt. 
“Last night should encourage him,” Maloney said of Biden. “Despite the opposition, despite the anger and the hatred and the lies that he has faced, the implacable obstruction that he has encountered, that he's making progress and that we're going to get through this together.”

This is the verdict. Neither candidate will reach the 50% of the vote plus 1 threshold needed to avoid the runoff. That’s the law in GA.

France opens investigation into cardinal who admitted to sexually abusing 14-year-old girl
By Delia Gallagher and Saskya Vandoorne, CNN
Published 3:12 PM EST, Tue November 8, 2022
French Cardinal Jean Pierre Bernard Ricard said he abused his victim 35 years ago when he was a parish priest.

CNN
 — 
French authorities have opened an investigation into one of highest-ranking members of France’s Catholic Church, who admitted to sexually abusing a 14-year-old girl when he was a parish priest, more than three decades ago.
French Cardinal Jean-Pierre Ricard, 78, made the stunning admission in a written statement which was read by the President of Conference of Bishops of France, Eric de Moulins-Beaufort, during a press conference in Lourdes on Monday.
The cardinal wrote in the statement that his behavior had been “reprehensible” and had “led to serious and lasting consequences for this person.”
Ricard said that he had asked for forgiveness from the victim, whom he said he abused 35 years ago, and her family. He added that he would be going on retreat to pray.
On Tuesday, Marseille prosecutor’s office said it has opened a preliminary investigation into the cardinal.
The cardinal’s admission has “shocked” Catholic bishops in France, Moulins-Beaufort said. It has also renewed scrutiny into sexual abuse in the Catholic Church, which has been shrouded with multiple reports detailing decades of sexual abuse, systemic failures and cover-ups across multiple countries.
Paris Archbishop allegedly involved in 'intimate relationship' with woman resigns
Ricard was made a cardinal in 2006 and is a former head of the French bishops’ conference. He retired as Archbishop of Bordeaux in 2019.
He is also a member of the Vatican’s Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith, which oversees investigations into sexual abuse cases.
According to Moulins-Beaufort, Ricard was among 11 former or current French bishops accused of cases linked to abuse.
The French civil authorities and the Vatican’s Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith have been informed about the revelations, he added.
Ricard said in his written statement that he intended to cooperate with civil and Catholic Church investigations in his case.
The Vatican spokesperson had no comment when reached by CNN.
A landmark report in 2021 found that members of the Catholic clergy in France sexually abused an estimated 216,000 minors over the past seven decades and that the Church prioritized the protection of the institution over survivors who were urged to stay silent.
Pope Francis said in September that he would take it on himself to rid the Church of sexual abuse, telling CNN’s partner channel CNN Portugal that he was “responsible that it doesn’t happen anymore.”

After Hillary lost, she went for a walk in the woods, wrote books, did podcasts & traveled the world advocating for human rights & democracy at large.
She didn’t once call for the Constitution to be terminated.

But do go on about how women are “too emotional to lead” won’t you.

Magic wall: See where we are in undecided Senate races02:11
2022 midterm election results
By Adrienne Vogt, Aditi Sangal, Mike Hayes, Elise Hammond, Maureen Chowdhury, Tara Subramaniam, Melissa Macaya and Meg Wagner, CNN
Updated 11:29 PM ET, Fri November 11, 2022
What we're covering here
Control of the Senate and House still in the balance: All eyes are on undecided Arizona and Nevada Senate races, as Georgia's contest heads to a Dec. 6 runoff. At least 400,000 votes remain to be counted in Arizona's Maricopa County alone, officials said.
Democrats flip key Senate seat: Democrat John Fetterman flipped Pennsylvania's Senate seat, CNN projected, boosting Democratic hopes of keeping their majority. Both parties now need two seats to win control of the Senate.
Biden addresses the country: President Biden called the midterms a ""good day for America,"" noting that the ""giant red wave"" that was predicted didn't happen and that it's still possible that Democrats hold the House.
Historic firsts: Both parties are diversifying their ranks. Here's a look at the candidates CNN projects will make history.

CNN Projection: Georgia’s Senate race between Warnock and Walker will head to a runoff

Georgia’s senatorial race between Republican Herschel Walker and Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock will head to a runoff, CNN can project, sending the high-profile race to a Dec. 6 showdown after neither candidate was able to receive more than 50% of the vote.

400,000 votes left to be counted in Maricopa County, official says

There are about 400,000 votes left to be counted in Arizona's Maricopa County, Board of Supervisors Chair Bill Gates said in a press conference Wednesday morning. This is up 100,000 votes from what Gates told CNN earlier this morning.
About 275,000 early ballots were dropped off on Election Day, Maricopa County Recorder Stephen Richer said. The election officials will need additional time to sort, count and verify the ballots. They are asking for patience as they work through the process and said they expect more than 95% of the votes will be counted by Friday. 
“This number is immense,” Richer said, adding there were about 170,000 early ballots dropped off on Election Day in 2020. 
They received 86,000 early ballots Friday and over the weekend, Richer said. Those ballots have already been processed and should be reported today, he said.
There are about 17,000 uncounted ballots that went into what they call “Box 3,” which means they were not run through the tabulator. These in-person ballots make up about 7% of in-person ballots, Gates said. There are always ballots that go into “Box 3,” Gates said, “but this is a higher percentage than normal.” Gates said those ballots are “secure” and will be tabulated in their central count facility.
Almost 1.2 million votes have already been reported, Gates said.

Rupert Murdoch's conservative media empire celebrates DeSantis's win
From CNN's Oliver Darcy

Rupert Murdoch, the media mogul who controls some of the most powerful organs in conservative media, appeared to make clear Wednesday that he would prefer to cast aside former President Donald Trump in favor of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis as the leader of the Republican party.
The New York Post, a tabloid Murdoch controls, hailed DeSantis' election night victory on its front page Wednesday morning. 
""DeFUTURE,"" the headline on the Post blared, alongside a photo of DeSantis and his family celebrating their major win in the Sunshine State.
On Fox News, the dominant television voice Murdoch controls, significant attention was given on Wednesday to DeSantis' victory. 
""I think Gov. DeSantis is the single biggest winner of the night,"" former House Speaker Newt Gingrich said on ""Fox & Friends,"" adding that he will ""almost certainly become the rallying point for everybody in the Republican Party who wants to move beyond President Trump.""
The homepage of Fox News also prominently featured a column by conservative commentator Liz Peek that declared DeSantis ""the new leader of the Republican Party."" Fox News dubbed it ""A NEW ERA.""
And at The Wall Street Journal, the broadsheet owned by Murdoch, the newspaper's conservative editorial board published a piece proclaiming the ""DeSantis Florida tsunami.""
""There’s little doubt that his Florida success will grab the attention of voters outside the Sunshine State,"" the editorial board wrote. ""You can bet Donald J. Trump was watching—unhappily.""
Coverage from Murdoch's media outlets is notable, given that they have significant sway over the Republican Party base and its power brokers.
""It is not an accident,"" a person familiar with how Murdoch runs the companies told CNN Wednesday morning when asked about the fact that the billionaire's media outlets were focusing attention on DeSantis as the future of the Republican Party.
The coverage from Murdoch's media outlets does not mean that they will completely turn on Trump. Rather, it suggests that Murdoch might use his influence to tilt the scales and push Republicans toward DeSantis if the two squared off in a 2024 Republican primary.
A spokesperson for Murdoch did not immediately return a request for comment. But Murdoch has in the past made clear his frustrations with Trump. 
Maggie Haberman, a reporter at The New York Times and CNN political analyst, reported recently in her bestselling book that after the 2020 election Murdoch remarked of Trump, ""We should throw this guy over.""

Biden will hold a press conference at 4 p.m. ET, White House says
From CNN's Betsy Klein
President Biden is set to continue the tradition of holding a formal press conference the day after the midterm elections and will take questions from reporters at 4 p.m. ET in the State Dining Room, the White House announced. 
“In the afternoon, the President will deliver remarks and take questions,” the White House said in an update to the President’s daily schedule Wednesday. 
The event will be open to press.
CNN’s MJ Lee reported Biden is expected to take a victory lap and argue that his party was able to avoid a bloodbath because at the end of the day, candidates were running on his agenda that proved to be popular. Biden will also continue to stand by the decision – which the White House was widely criticized for in the final weeks – to spend time and energy discussing issues like abortion rights, protecting democracy and election integrity, in addition to the economy and inflation. 
Biden advisers point to exit polls and ballot initiatives as clear proof that those other issues needed up being hugely motivating for voters.
Past presidents have traditionally held press conferences the day after midterm elections. They have produced noteworthy moments, like when then-President Barack Obama acknowledged a ""shellacking"" for Democrats in 2010. 
Obama held press conferences following midterm elections in 2010 and 2014. Former President Donald Trump held a press conference after midterms in 2018. And former President George W. Bush held press conferences after the midterm elections in 2002 and 2006.
“You're going to hear from the President. He always enjoys taking your questions,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters earlier this week.

Republican Lawler won ""fair and square,"" Maloney says in concession speech
From CNN's Gregory Krieg

New York Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney, the leader of the House Democratic campaign arm, publicly conceded his race to Republican Mike Lawler in a Wednesday morning press conference, saying Lawler “won fair and square” and pledging his support to man who will replace him in Congress.
CNN has not yet projected a winner in this race.
Maloney was in the awkward position of touting House Democrats’ exceeding of pre-election expectations while also trying to make sense of his own defeat, which was part of Republican near-sweep of the New York City suburbs.
“I don't like to lose. But my opponent won this race, and he won fair and square. And that means something,�� Maloney said. “I'm not going to whine about it. I'm going to do this the right way and the right thing to do is to say the other guy won, to wish him well and to pledge my support,” he added.
Maloney said he spoke to President Biden earlier and “expressed our appreciation for his leadership on the issues that matter to the American people.”
In recounting his conversation with Biden, Maloney said the president was “interested in where we end up.” Republicans appear likely to win a House majority, but the margin remains very much in doubt. 
“Last night should encourage him,” Maloney said of Biden. “Despite the opposition, despite the anger and the hatred and the lies that he has faced, the implacable obstruction that he has encountered, that he's making progress and that we're going to get through this together.”

This is how Powerball security teams protect a record-high jackpot drawing

 — 
The owner of Joe’s Service Center in Altadena, California, who came to the United States from Syria in 1980 with $14,000 in his pocket, is now a millionaire after selling the sole winning Powerball lottery ticket.
California Lottery officials presented the check to Joe Chahayed and his sons Joe Jr. and Danny on a rainy election day outside of their gas station.

Chahayed said lottery officials were waiting for him before he opened his shop this morning. “They said, ‘congratulations, your station sent a winner,’” he recounted.
Chahayed hopes the winner is from the neighborhood, and is glad a portion of the lottery money will go towards California schools. “I have 11 grandchildren and I have to share with them,” he said, then thanked the media for coming out in the rain to celebrate the winnings. “I encourage you to buy a ticket from this station. We guarantee you one day you’re going to be winners too,” said Chahayed.
“Somebody is holding on to a very important piece of paper this morning worth $2.04 billion, that’s two billion forty million dollars,” said Carolyn Becker, California Lottery spokesperson. “That person needs to keep it safe. We will not know who they are until they come forward, but we have a second record to talk about today and that’s California lottery raised more money than ever thanks to one growing jackpot for California public schools.” She said this is the first time the California lottery has created a billionaire.
Chahayed came to America 42 years ago with his wife and two children. “I work hard, seven days a week, I raise my kids, graduate from college, I bought a house, and I bought a business all because I work hard and I’m an honest man,” Chahayed boasted.

What we covered here
Russia's defense minister has ordered the withdrawal of Russian troops from the west bank of the Dnipro River in Kherson as Ukrainian forces make advances toward the city, according to state media.
President Volodymyr Zelensky told CNN that the Russia announcement may be a strategic move to regroup forces.
US President Joe Biden said he’s hopeful that with the midterm election over, President Vladimir Putin will be more willing to discuss the release of WNBA star Brittney Griner.
One of the most senior Russian-appointed officials in occupied Ukrainian territory has been killed in a road accident, according to the Russian-installed leader of the Kherson region.

Our live coverage of Russia's war in Ukraine has moved here.
8:58 p.m. ET, November 9, 2022
US military chief: Over 100,000 Russian soldiers killed or wounded in conflict – and same on Ukrainian side
From CNN's Oren Liebermann 
Russia has suffered more than 100,000 killed and wounded soldiers as a result of the war in Ukraine, the top US general said Wednesday evening, and Ukraine is probably looking at similar numbers.
Joint Chiefs Chair Gen. Mark Milley, speaking at an event at The Economic Club of New York, called Russia’s invasion of Ukraine a “tremendous strategic mistake” for which the country would pay “for years and years and years to come.”
The war, which began in late February, has caused a tremendous amount of human suffering, Milley said, including between 15-30 million refugees and about 40,000 innocent Ukrainian civilians killed. 
""You’re looking at well over 100,000 Russian soldiers killed and wounded,"" Milley said. ""Same thing probably on the Ukrainian side.""
Milley said there may be a window of opportunity to negotiate an end to the conflict if and when the front lines stabilize during winter. 
“When there’s an opportunity to negotiate when peace can be achieved, seize it,” Milley said. “Seize the moment.”
But if negotiations never materialized or failed, Milley said the US would continue to arm Ukraine, even as an outright military victory for either side looks increasingly unlikely.
“There has to be a mutual recognition that military victory is probably in the true sense of the word may be not achievable through military means, and therefore you need to turn to other means.” 
Milley also said the US was seeing initial indications that Russia was indeed pulling out of Kherson, as it had stated. But he said the withdrawal of 20,000-30,000 troops from the west bank of the Dnipro River could take days or even weeks. 
“I believe they’re doing it in order to preserve their force, to re-establish defensive lines south of the river, but that remains to be seen,” Milley said. “Right now, the early indicators are they’re doing what they say they’re doing and we’re seeing those early indicators.”

Zelensky says Russia's announcement of a withdrawal near Kherson might just be a regroup
President Volodymyr Zelensky said Wednesday that Russia's announcement of a withdrawal near the southern city of Kherson may be a strategic move to regroup forces.
But he also said, in an interview with CNN's Christiane Amanpour, that at a time of his choosing, Ukrainian progress on the battlefield would come.
""So they [The Russians] are ready to defend this region and they’re not ready to leave the city, and the fact that they are in these homes [they’ve occupied] means that they are seriously preparing, but we are also seriously prepared for these developments.""
He added that Ukrainians ""are not considering this as just one single operation.""
""We have a strategy and different directions,"" he added.
Some background: Russian state media reported that Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu has ordered a withdrawal of Russian forces from the west bank of the Dnipro River in the Kherson region. His order comes as Ukrainian forces make advances toward the city of Kherson from two directions.

Biden says he hopes Putin will be more willing to negotiate Griner's release with midterms over
From CNN's Nikki Carvajal
(Susan Walsh/AP)
US President Joe Biden said he’s hopeful that with the midterm election over, Russian President Vladimir Putin will be more willing to discuss the release of WNBA star Brittney Griner, who was recently transferred to a Russian penal colony to serve the remainder of a nine-year drug smuggling sentence that was upheld in late October. 
“My guess is – my hope is that now that the election is over, that Mr. Putin will be able to discuss with us and be willing to talk more seriously about prisoner exchange,” Biden said Wednesday during a news conference at the White House. “That is my intention. My intention is to get her home.”
The president said the US has had discussions with Russia – but is hoping that with the election over, ""there is a willingness to negotiate more specifically with us.""
Asked if he could explain some of the alternative ways forward the administration had previously referred to and how Russia had responded to them, Biden answered, “I can but I won’t.” 
“I’m determined to get her home safely, along with others I might add,” he said.
4:58 p.m. ET, November 9, 2022
Biden says timing of Russia's withdrawal announcement is evidence they have ""some real problems""
From CNN's Nikki Carvajal
US President Joe Biden said the timing of Russia's announcement that it is withdrawing its troops from part of Kherson region was “interesting,” and that he had been told that Russian President Vladimir Putin was not likely to attend the upcoming G20 summit in Indonesia. 
“I find it interesting they waited until after the election to make that judgment, which we knew for some time they were going to be doing, and it’s evidence of the fact that they have some real problems – the Russian military,” Biden said Wednesday. 
He said where the withdrawal leads and “whether or not Ukraine is prepared to compromise with Russia” remains to be seen. 
Biden added that he was “told that President Putin is not likely” to attend the G20 in Indonesia, but other world leaders would be “and we're going to have an opportunity to see what the next steps may be.”

Zelensky says Ukrainian forces will move carefully to strengthen positions in south
From Tim Lister, Julia Kesaieva and Darya Tarasova
(Presidential Office of Ukraine)
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said his country will ""move very carefully, without emotions, without unnecessary risk,"" in the light of Russia's announcement that it is withdrawing its troops from part of Kherson region. 
In his daily video message, Zelensky said, ""We are gradually moving to the south, strengthening our positions. Step by step.""
""There is a lot of joy in the information space today — and it is clear why,"" Zelensky said.
""But our emotions must be restrained — always during the war. I will definitely not feed the enemy with all the details of our operations. Whether in the south, or in the east, or anywhere else — when our result is achieved, everyone will see it."" 
""This is how we will ensure the liberation of Kherson, Kakhovka, Donetsk and our other cities,"" the Ukrainian president said.
""No one just leaves if they do not feel strong. The enemy does not give us gifts, does not make 'gestures of goodwill.' We fight for it,"" Zelensky said.
""And when you fight, you must understand that every step is always the enemy's resistance, it is always the loss of lives of our heroes.""
""Currently, the toughest battles are in Donetsk region, a lot is being decided there,"" he said.
Zelensky also referred to warnings from Ukrainian officials that Russia might try to destroy the large hydro-electric project and dam on the Dnipro River.
""I want to warn once again and separately everyone in Moscow who makes the relevant decisions: any attempt to blow up Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant and flood our territory and dewater the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant [which is upstream from the dam] will mean your declaration of war to the whole world,"" he said.
The Russian general in command of forces in the Kremlin's so-called Special Military Operation, Sergey Surovikin, has claimed it is the Ukrainians who are planning to destroy the dam.
""The implementation of the enemy's plans to create a flood zone below the Kakhovka hydroelectric power station can lead to dangerous consequences. This is confirmed by the constant missile attacks on the dam of the Kakhovskaya hydroelectric power station, as well as on the spillway gates of this dam,"" Surovikin said Wednesday.
""If the Kyiv regime goes for a further increase in the release of water from reservoirs or a more powerful missile attack on the Kakhovka dam, a flow of water will be formed that will create vast flood zones and cause significant casualties among the civilian population,"" Surovikin said.
Zelensky also addressed ongoing power outages caused by waves of Russian missile attacks. 
""As of this evening, there are stabilization (scheduled) restrictions on electricity supply in 15 regions and the city of Kyiv. There are no emergency shutdowns,"" he said.
4:18 p.m. ET, November 9, 2022
British national dies in Ukraine, UK government says
From CNN's Niamh Kennedy in London 
The UK government said Wednesday that a British man lost his life in Ukraine.
The UK foreign office in a statement said that it was ""supporting the family of a British national who has lost his life in Ukraine,"" but did not reveal the person's name.
The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) added that it was in touch with ""the local authorities in connection with his death."" 
In June, former British Army soldier Jordan Gatley was shot and killed while fighting in Ukraine's Severodonetsk, CNN reported at the time. 
British aid worker Paul Urey died in the annexed Donetsk region of Ukraine earlier this year after the Russian invasion started, CNN reported.
4:03 p.m. ET, November 9, 2022
US diplomats have asked Russia about where WNBA star Brittney Griner is and where she is going
From CNN's Kylie Atwood
US diplomats have asked Russia for information about the current location of WNBA star Brittney Griner and where she is going but the Russians have not provided any answers, a senior State Department official said Wednesday. 
The diplomats’ requests come after news broke that Griner is being transferred to a remote penal colony in Russia, a move that US Secretary of State Antony Blinken called “another injustice layered on her ongoing unjust and wrongful detention.”
“We are communicating very clearly to the Russians requesting information on her current location as well as her destination in addition to the message that we expect consistent with their obligations, including under under the Vienna Convention, to have a consistent consular access to Brittney Griner,” the official said. 
Russia ""unfortunately followed past practice"" and did not notify the US ahead of moving Griner to a penal colony, the official said. While the US expected that she would be transferred, they found out about the move from Griner's legal team and press reports. 
Past American detainees in Russia have gone to a central location before they arrive at a prison camp and that process can take a couple of weeks, the official said. The US does not know how she will be treated at the prison camp because Russia has many different kinds of camps that treat prisoners differently.

Chechen leader praises partial withdrawal of Russian forces in Kherson
From Darya Tarasova 
Ramzan Kadyrov, leader of the Russian province of Chechnya gestures speaking to about 10,000 troops in Chechnya's regional capital of Grozny, Russia, on Tuesday, March 29, 2022. (AP)
Ramzan Kadyrov, the the pro-Kremlin leader of Russia's Chechnya region, said he supports the decision by the Russian Defense Ministry and the commander in Ukraine to withdraw troops from part of the Kherson region.
Kadyrov, who has frequently criticized the ministry and the leadership of the operation, said that Gen. Sergey Surovikin had ""saved a thousand soldiers who were in actual encirclement.""
""After weighing all the pros and cons, General Surovikin made a difficult but right choice between senseless sacrifices for the sake of loud statements and saving the priceless lives of soldiers,"" he said.
""There is no need to talk about the 'surrender' of Kherson. 'Surrender' means together with the fighters. And Surovikin protects the soldiers and takes a more advantageous strategic position - convenient, safe,"" Kadyrov said on his Telegram channel. 
""Everyone knew from the very first days of the special operation that Kherson was a difficult combat territory. The soldiers of my units also reported that it was very difficult to fight in this area,"" especially ""without the possibility of a stable regular supply of ammunition and the formation of a strong, reliable rear.""
But again criticizing past mistakes, he asked: ""Why was this not done from the first days of the special operation? This is another question.""
""I believe that Surovikin acted like a real military general, not afraid of criticism. He is responsible for the people,"" Kadyrov concluded.

Voter ID, citizenship, ranked-choice voting: Here’s what voters in these states decided about rules for future elections
By Fredreka Schouten, Shawna Mizelle and Paul LeBlanc, CNN

 — 
Voters in several states on Tuesday were asked whether to amend rules that will determine how elections will be run in the future, focusing on issues such as citizenship and registration, photo identification, and early voting.
Several states have approved new rules, according to CNN projections. Here’s what we know so far:
Arizona: Voters rejected a ballot measure that stemmed from Republican legislators’ concerns about the security of the 2020 election and would have mandated that in-person voters present an unexpired photo ID that included their names and addresses.
Connecticut: Connecticut voters backed a state constitutional amendment to allow no-excuse early voting, clearing the way for the state legislature to further consider the step. Connecticut currently is one of just a handful of states without some form of early, in-person voting before Election Day, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
Nebraska: Voters approved a ballot initiative that would require voters in the state to present a valid photo ID to cast ballots which is among the most restrictive in the country. State lawmakers will be responsible for writing legislation to implement the change.
Marijuana legalization on the ballot in these states: Here's what voters decided
Ohio: Voters backed an amendment to their state constitution that will bar local governments from allowing noncitizens to vote in local elections. It also requires citizens to be registered voters 30 days ahead of Election Day to cast a ballot.
Michigan: Voters supported an amendment to Michigan’s constitution to ease rules for voting in a variety of ways. The measures establish nine days of in-person early voting, require state funding for ballot drop boxes, and provide prepaid postage to return absentee ballots, among other things.
Nevada: Nevadans voted in support of ranked-choice voting. If voters approve the measure again in 2024, state lawmakers would have to pass legislation implementing the change in order for it to take effect.
The measure would establish an open primary in which the top five candidates who received the most votes would move on to the general election.
In the general election, voters would then rank their preferences among the remaining candidates. If a candidate is the highest ranked on a majority of ballots in the general election, that candidate is declared the winner and the tabulation is over. If no candidate emerges as the outright winner, more rounds of tabulation would proceed. The ranked-choice voting measure must pass in 2024 as well.
This story has been updated with additional developments.

Magic wall: See where we are in undecided Senate races02:11
2022 midterm election results
By Adrienne Vogt, Aditi Sangal, Mike Hayes, Elise Hammond, Maureen Chowdhury, Tara Subramaniam, Melissa Macaya and Meg Wagner, CNN
Updated 11:29 PM ET, Fri November 11, 2022
What we're covering here
Control of the Senate and House still in the balance: All eyes are on undecided Arizona and Nevada Senate races, as Georgia's contest heads to a Dec. 6 runoff. At least 400,000 votes remain to be counted in Arizona's Maricopa County alone, officials said.
Democrats flip key Senate seat: Democrat John Fetterman flipped Pennsylvania's Senate seat, CNN projected, boosting Democratic hopes of keeping their majority. Both parties now need two seats to win control of the Senate.
Biden addresses the country: President Biden called the midterms a ""good day for America,"" noting that the ""giant red wave"" that was predicted didn't happen and that it's still possible that Democrats hold the House.
Historic firsts: Both parties are diversifying their ranks. Here's a look at the candidates CNN projects will make history.

CNN Projection: Republican Sen. Ron Johnson wins reelection in key Wisconsin Senate race

Republican Sen. Ron Johnson will win reelection in Wisconsin, CNN projects, defeating Democratic Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes in one of the nation’s most important Senate races. 
The victory was another demonstration of the remarkable political durability of Johnson, 67, who has now won three consecutive hard-fought elections, despite polls that long showed him among the least popular senators up for re-election this year. 
In holding off Barnes — who Democrats had viewed at the outset of this year’s election cycle as a potential rising star — Johnson has also bolstered the GOP��s hopes of winning control of the Senate.

Analysis: Election deniers were the losers in the midterms
Analysis from CNN's Chris Cillizza
The 2022 election is now in the books, although vote counting continues in a lot of places with so many races still uncalled. Democrats, who were expected to suffer considerable losses in the House, appear to have held their own, but they still look likely to wind up in the minority.
The Senate is a nip-and-tuck affair, with Democrats currently netting a single seat in Pennsylvania. Now, all eyes are on Arizona, Georgia and Nevada, all of which are too early to call. 
However, it's clear that 2020 election deniers were the losers in the midterm election results so far.
Several high-profile election deniers running for governor across the country came out on the losing end. In Wisconsin, Tim Michels lost. In Michigan, Dixon fell short. Mastriano got blown out in Pennsylvania. Ditto Dan Cox in Maryland. And Darren Bailey in Illinois.
While CNN hasn't called the Arizona governor's race, Republican Kari Lake is trailing.

Republican Mehmet Oz called Democrat John Fetterman to concede the Pennsylvania Senate race at 9:30 a.m. ET this morning, according to Fetterman campaign spokesperson Joe Calvello. 
Oz campaign manager Casey Contres confirmed the call to CNN.
Later on Wednesday morning, Oz released a statement of concession.
""This morning I called John Fetterman and congratulated him. I wish him and his family all the best, both personally and as our next United States Senator,"" the statement reads.
Oz also thanked his supporters and campaign workers, saying the campaign ""was the honor of a lifetime.""
""Pennsylvanians showed up with passion and a vision for a bright future that I found inspiring every day. I want to thank my supporters, so many of whom worked tirelessly to spread our message and support me and my family,"" he said. ""We are facing big problems as a country and we need everyone to put down their partisan swords and focus on getting the job done. With bold leadership that brings people together, we can create real change.""

House Democratic campaign chair Sean Patrick Maloney concedes New York race
From CNN's Greg Krieg and Sarah Fortinsky
New York Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney, chair of the House Democratic campaign arm, has conceded his race to Republican Mike Lawler, a state assembly member from Rockland County. 
Maloney’s spokesperson Mia Ehrenberg confirmed the concession to CNN.
CNN has not yet projected a winner in this race.
Lawler told Fox News on Wednesday that Maloney ""just called me a few minutes ago and was very gracious in conceding to me.”
He called it “a hard-fought campaign” and said “people wanted change.""
Lawler also acknowledged the difference of the newly redistricted map, saying when the map came out, “I took one look at it and knew that I could win it.”
“He didn’t have that built-in advantage of incumbency that a normal incumbent would have,” Lawler said of the new map.
Lawler said it looked like he might lose Westchester County, acknowledging it has become increasingly Democratic, and said, “I got a lot of work to do over there to make inroads over the next two years and I look forward to doing that.”

Republicans won over White women and Democrats lost support among Latino voters
This year, Republicans won a majority of White women, an important voting bloc the two parties split in 2018.
Republicans also made good on predictions that they would perform better among Latino voters than they did four years ago.
Democrats’ support among Latino men was 63% in 2018 and is under 55% in 2022, according to the early exit polls. Republicans appeared to cut into Democrats’ advantage among Latino women, although Democrats still got the support of about two-thirds of them.
Here's a look at the changes between 2018 and 2022:

Key Trump-backed candidates have a rough night as crucial races are still too early to call
From CNN's Maegan Vazquez
Former President Donald Trump's endorsements for political candidates in close high-profile races have not yet given Republicans the swift and sweeping victories they had anticipated for this election cycle, despite many GOP hopefuls banking on his support to propel their campaigns. 
Many critical midterm races have yet to be called as of Wednesday morning, but so far, no Republican endorsed by Trump in a toss-up gubernatorial, US Senate or House race has won. Among those toss-up races where Trump had publicly backed a candidate, CNN projects the governor's seat in Wisconsin, a Senate seat for Pennsylvania and four House seats are going to Democrats.
The Trump-backed candidate with the highest profile who pulled out a win was JD Vance in Ohio, who is projected to become the next US senator from Ohio after defeating Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan. CNN had rated that race as lean Republican.
Trump has traveled across the country, stumping for Republicans at huge rallies that mirrored event programs of his past presidential campaign stops — implicitly framing himself as the leader of the party. Now, as Republicans begin to reckon with what the results mean, they'll also have to address whether Trump's agenda will help or hurt in the 2024 elections. 
A Trump adviser who has been in contact with Trump's inner circle told CNN that the former president is ""livid"" and ""screaming at everyone"" after the results.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi accepted Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin's apology about remarks he made about her husband, Pelosi's spokesperson said.
The Virginia Republican sent her a handwritten note of apology for comments he made after the assault on her husband Paul Pelosi, her spokesperson told CNN.
The letter comes after Youngkin, while stumping for congressional candidate Yesli Vega, said about Paul Pelosi's assault: “Speaker Pelosi’s husband had a break-in last night in their house, and he was assaulted. There’s no room for violence anywhere, but we’re gonna send her back to be with him in California. That’s what we’re going to go do.”
After his remarks, he told Punchbowl News: ""At the end of the day, I really wanted to express the fact that what happened to Speaker Pelosi’s husband was atrocious. And I didn’t do a great job.” 
Punchbowl was the first to report about the letter."

A man can be in the worst position and all he will say is “I’ll take care of it”

He might be flat broke with no hope, but that’s what he will say.

And might get grumpy but somehow he always finds a way.

Respect to all the real men out there that do the impossible daily.

As US heads towards a potentially divided government, Biden aims to assert American leadership abroad
From CNN's Kevin Liptak
(Susan Walsh/AP)
It’s a story President Joe Biden tells at nearly every opportunity: last year, meeting his new counterparts at his first international summit, he proudly informed them, “America is back.”
“For how long?” one of them asked.
As Biden departs this week for a weeklong around-the-world trip, the question still resonates.
“If the United States tomorrow were to, quote, withdraw from the world, a lot of things would change around the world. A whole lot would change,” Biden said ahead of his trip.
Biden hopes his stops at a climate meeting here on the Red Sea, a gathering of Southeast Asian nations in Cambodia and a high-stakes Group of 20 summit on the Indonesian island of Bali will assert American leadership in areas former President Donald Trump either ignored or actively shunned.
Four defining global threats will loom over Biden’s trip: Russia’s war in Ukraine, escalating tensions with China, the existential problem of climate change and the potential for a global recession in the coming months. Other flashpoints, like North Korea’s rapidly accelerating provocations and uncertainty over Iran’s nuclear program, will also factor in. 
Of those, defending Ukraine and combating climate change could be the most impacted by results from this week’s election. 
At moments of domestic political turmoil, US presidents have often turned to foreign policy, where they can act with relatively few congressional restraints. President Barack Obama launched a similar tour of Asia after his self-described “shellacking” in the 2010 midterms. 
Biden and his advisers believe they are entering the series of high-stakes meetings with a solid argument that his version of the US role in the world will endure. He resisted historical and political headwinds in this year’s midterm elections while many of Trump’s handpicked candidates lost. And over the past year, he secured passage of a major climate investment and rallied the world behind efforts to support Ukraine and isolate Russia.
Yet the anxieties of American allies persist over the future of US commitments – to Ukraine, to fighting climate change, to treaty partners and, perhaps most urgently, to upholding Democratic norms. Foreign diplomats have watched intently as the midterm political season played out, searching for clues to how the American electorate was judging Biden's first two years in office and reporting back to their capitals on voter dissatisfaction that could fuel Trump's return to office.
As of Wednesday night, Republicans appeared to be moving toward gaining control of the House of Representatives. And Trump is readying a third presidential bid, potentially to be announced while Biden is on the opposite side of the planet.

Senate control could hinge on two states with prominent election deniers 
From CNN's Maeve Reston

Control of the US Senate could hinge on Nevada and Arizona, two states where GOP victories could elevate some of the most prominent election deniers in the country even after other nominees who had amplified former President Donald Trump’s falsehoods about the 2020 election were rejected by voters in Tuesday’s midterm elections.
Those two western states – perpetual battlegrounds in presidential years – were still too early to call as of early Thursday morning, while a third Democratic-held seat, Georgia, will advance to a December runoff, CNN projects. Republicans need to pick off two Democratic seats to win the majority. As ballots continue to be counted across the country, Republicans appear to be slowly inching toward the 218 seats that would deliver them a House majority, albeit one that’s much narrower than they’d hoped.
The struggle for the Senate, however, is still full of unknowns – including whether it will all come down once again to Georgia after the Peach State delivered Democrats the majority in 2021 with victories in twin runoffs. It’s Nevada and Arizona that will determine how pivotal Georgia becomes.
Arizona Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly was maintaining an edge over Republican Blake Masters as of early Thursday morning, while Nevada Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto was trailing Republican Adam Laxalt. CNN had estimated late Wednesday that about 600,000 votes remained to be counted across the Grand Canyon State and about 160,000 votes remained to be counted in Nevada.
Nevada: Laxalt, the state's former attorney general, was a co-chairman of Trump’s 2020 presidential campaign in the state and filed lawsuits attempting to overturn Nevada’s results in that election, which he said was “rigged.” Cortez Masto had argued that the lies and election conspiracy theories embraced by Trump and allies like Laxalt led to the attack on the US Capitol on January 6, 2021.
Arizona: Masters, a venture capitalist and first-time candidate, released a campaign video as he was competing for the GOP nomination in which he said he believed Trump had won the 2020 election. Masters, like Laxalt, clinched Trump’s endorsement.
After winning the Arizona Senate primary, Masters briefly appeared to back away from some of that extreme rhetoric – scrubbing his website, for example, of language that included the false claim that the election was stolen. In a debate with Kelly, he also conceded that he had not seen evidence of fraud that would have changed the outcome of the election. But the Republican nominee seemed to reverse course after receiving a phone call from Trump urging him to “go stronger” on election denialism, a conversation that was captured in a Fox documentary.

Analysis: A midterm stalemate will unleash turmoil and acrimony in run up to 2024
From CNN's Stephen Collinson
US democracy, which almost buckled two years ago, just delivered a perfect reflection of a polarized nation that mistrusts its leaders and isn’t ready to unite on a new path.
Tuesday’s midterm elections gave Americans two more years to collectively decide what they really want by likely ushering in a divided government that is certain to be acrimonious but will prevent Democrats or Republicans from engineering a major ideological shift. It also scrambled the terrain of the early 2024 presidential race, with President Joe Biden and ex-President Donald Trump both moving toward new campaigns that much of the country appears not to want.
A divided government would mean two years of dysfunction, bitterness, fiscal cliffs and debt showdowns between a Republican House and the Democratic White House. Token talk of bipartisan cooperation won’t last long. Even if Democrats somehow manage to cling to the House as final results trickle in, they’d also lack the leeway to pass nation-changing laws. And whoever wins the Senate majority, the chamber will effectively be split down the middle and locked in an angry stalemate. Like America itself.
What this means for 2024: The election results pose new questions heading into the next White House campaign over the prospects of both Trump and Biden. Trump’s obsession with promoting chaos candidates in his image may yet again doom Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell’s chances of returning as majority leader. Trump, of course, is already blaming everyone but himself as he eyes a campaign launch next week that will lack the springboard of a Republican landslide he would have claimed was all his doing. And the roaring reelection of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis presented Trump with a huge potential 2024 GOP primary headache.
Biden, meanwhile, seemed unusually upbeat for a president who may soon face a tsunami of subpoenas, investigations and even possible impeachment from a GOP House. He enjoyed calling out the conventional wisdom during a White House news conference on Wednesday afternoon. “While the press and the pundits were predicting a giant red wave, it didn’t happen,” he said.
When Biden meets world leaders in the coming days in Egypt and Bali, Indonesia, he can crow about escaping the epic first-term shellacking suffered by most presidents. He also put off an immediate inquest about his suitability to carry the Democratic banner into 2024, ahead of a vacation he said he’d like to take between Thanksgiving and Christmas with First Lady Jill Biden to consider his future.
Yet a loss is a loss. And CNN exit polls show only 30% of House race voters want a president with a low-40s approval rating, who will be 80 in a few weeks, to run for reelection in a campaign that could well coincide with the recession many economists fear. Biden would prefer another finding from those same polls, however, that showed Trump – with a 39% approval rating – is even less popular.

Here's where things stand with the balance of power in the Senate and the House
From CNN's Ethan Cohen
With the day after the election wrapping up, control of Congress remains undetermined.
Republicans hold 49 seats in the Senate, while the Democrats have 48. Two states are uncalled and Georgia's Senate seat will be decided by a December runoff election.
In the House, it could be days until a full picture emerges as votes are still being counted in states like California, Oregon, Nevada and Arizona. 
Senate
It's still too early to call which party will gain control of the Senate.
Democrats have had the only pickup so far with John Fetterman’s win in Pennsylvania, but they still need to win two more seats to guarantee control. 
On Wednesday, CNN projected that GOP Sen. Ron Johnson would hold his seat in Wisconsin and that Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock and Republican Herschel Walker will be headed to a Dec. 6 runoff in Georgia. 
CNN hasn’t made a projection of party control in two other seats – Arizona and Nevada. 
As of 11:30 p.m. ET, Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona was ahead of Republican Blake Masters by about 95,000 votes after a vote report from Maricopa County expanded Kelly’s lead. CNN estimates that as of 11:30 p.m. Wednesday, about 600,000 votes remain to be counted in Arizona.
In Nevada, Republican Adam Laxalt currently leads the count against Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto. CNN estimates that as of 11:30 p.m. Wednesday, about 160,000 votes remain to be counted in Nevada.
Nightly vote reports from the largest counties are expected in both states.
While CNN has projected that Alaska’s Senate seat will be controlled by Republicans, CNN has not projected whether Sen. Lisa Murkowski or Kelly Tshibaka will prevail. If neither gets over 50% of first-choice votes, the contest will be decided by ranked-choice voting. 
 Click here for the most up-to-date numbers. 
House
There are currently 35 uncalled House races – Democrats lead in the vote count in 24 of them as of 11:30 p.m. while Republicans lead in 11. 
Republicans need to win 9 more seats to reach the 218 needed to control the House, Democrats need to win 27 more seats to reach 218.

Analysis: Why the news media got the midterm ""red wave"" narrative so wrong
From CNN's Oliver Darcy
The White House believes that the press has “egg on their faces, yet again.”
That’s according to a White House official who spoke candidly with CNN on Wednesday about the media’s “red wave” narrative that wasn’t.
Heading into Tuesday, the dominant narrative in the press — especially right-wing media — was that Republicans were on track to have a big, if not monster, night. Focusing largely on the fragile state of the economy, coupled with the fact that the incumbent party historically doesn’t perform well in such elections, the press had all but declared that Democrats would get trounced from coast-to-coast.
But as election results came in Tuesday night, the great wave turned into a mere ripple. Pundits such as Ben Shapiro noted the view had gone “from red wave to red wedding.” Even on Fox News, the right-wing cable network that had heavily hyped the red wave presumption to its audience, pundits acknowledged the reality. Marc Thiessen, a former speechwriter for President George W. Bush, called it an “absolute disaster” for the GOP.
So what happened?

Female governors will break a record in 2023

The US will have a record number of female governors in 2023. Still, the record-setting number – 12 – will represent a small fraction of the top executives across the 50 states.
The previous record of nine female governors serving concurrently was set in 2004, according to the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University.
Incumbent female governors in Maine, Alabama, Michigan, Iowa, South Dakota, Kansas and New Mexico won reelection on Tuesday, while New York Gov. Kathy Hochul won a first full term after taking over the top job in 2021 following the resignation of Andrew Cuomo. Hochul will become the first elected female governor in the state.
Two states – Massachusetts and Arkansas – elected new female governors. Democrat Maura Healey will become the first woman elected to the governorship of Massachusetts and the first out lesbian governor in the US. Republican Sarah Huckabee Sanders, a former White House press secretary in the Trump administration, will become the state’s first female governor, winning the job that her father once held.
Arkansas and Massachusetts will also become the first states to have women serving in the governor and lieutenant governor positions at the same time, according to CAWP.

Voters deliver ringing endorsement of abortion rights via midterm ballot initiatives
From CNN's Veronica Stracqualursi, Devan Cole and Paul LeBlanc

Voters in key states on Tuesday made their support for abortion rights clear, affirming a months-long push by Democrats to act on a number of ballot measures in the wake of the Supreme Court’s decision overturning Roe v. Wade.
Several states moved to enshrine abortion protections in their constitutions and others rejected proposals to limit abortion access or criminalize doctors in some cases. Democratic lawmakers and organizers cast the midterm elections as a referendum on Republican efforts to limit women’s choices, and the notable electoral reaction could serve as a warning sign for future GOP efforts to restrict the procedure at the state level.
About 27% of voters cited abortion as the issue most important to them, according to the preliminary results of the national and state exit polls conducted for CNN and other news networks by Edison Research. The results also showed that when it comes to the issue, roughly half of voters said they trusted Democratic candidates, compared with more than four in 10 voters who said they trusted Republican candidates.
“This fall, Roe is on the ballot,” President Joe Biden declared in a defiant speech from the White House just hours after the Supreme Court’s ruling earlier this year.
While CNN projected some anti-abortion Republicans will win their races, voters in five states moved to affirm abortion rights.

Democratic Rep. Raul Ruiz will defeat Republican Brian Hawkins in California's 25th District and Democratic Rep. Marilyn Strickland will defeat Republican Keith Swank in Washington's 10th District, CNN projects.
Democrats now have 191 of the 218 seats required to control the House, according to CNN's projections.
Correction: An earlier version of this post misstated the first name of Rep. Raul Ruiz.

Key Trump-backed candidates have a rough night as crucial races still too early to call
By Maegan Vazquez, CNN
Updated 12:48 PM EST, Wed November 9, 2022
Gaelen Morse/Reuters
CNN
 — 
Former President Donald Trump’s endorsements for political candidates in close high-profile races have not yet given Republicans the swift and sweeping victories they had anticipated for this election cycle, despite many GOP hopefuls banking on his support to propel their campaigns.
Many critical midterm races have yet to be called as of Wednesday morning, but so far, no Republican endorsed by Trump in a toss-up gubernatorial, US Senate or House race has won. Among those toss-up races where Trump had publicly backed a candidate, CNN projects the governor’s seats in Wisconsin and Kansas, a Senate seat in Pennsylvania and four House seats are going to Democrats.
2022 midterm election results
The Trump-backed candidate with the highest profile who pulled out a win was JD Vance in Ohio, who is projected to become the next US senator from Ohio after defeating Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan. CNN had rated that race as lean Republican. Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin is also projected to win reelection in a race that CNN rated as tilt Republican.
Trump has traveled across the country, stumping for Republicans at huge rallies that mirrored event programs of his past presidential campaign stops – implicitly framing himself as the leader of the party. Now, as Republicans begin to reckon with what the results mean, they’ll also have to address whether Trump’s agenda will help or hurt in the 2024 elections.
A Trump adviser who has been in contact with Trump’s inner circle told CNN that the former president is “livid” and “screaming at everyone” after the results. “They were all bad candidates,” the adviser said, critiquing many of Trump’s handpicked contenders in key battleground states.
Republicans expected sweeping victories Tuesday night, which they had framed as a rebuke of President Joe Biden’s political agenda, setting the stage for the 2024 races. But the fate of both chambers continues to lie in the balance as vote counts trickle in among a national electorate that is choosing to vote early and vote by mail more often.
Democratic pick up in Pennsylvania boosts their hopes of holding Senate
Democrats scored a major pickup with Lt. Gov. John Fetterman’s win in Pennsylvania against Trump’s hand selected candidate Dr. Mehmet Oz, but they still need to win two more seats to guarantee control. And Republicans need to win 12 more seats to reach the 218 needed to control the House, with CNN not yet projecting which party will take over.
There are still key toss up races that are still too early to call.
Eyes are on Arizona, where some vote counts in the state’s most populous county, Maricopa County, were delayed due to ballots that could not be successfully read at polling places. The county’s votes were reported by early Wednesday, with additional results expected to be reported by Wednesday night. Counting is also expected to continue into Wednesday in Nevada.
And in Georgia, the race to elect the state’s next US senator was neck-and-neck, with CNN projecting Wednesday afternoon that it’s going to a runoff next month.
The current occupant of the White House and his allies, meanwhile, are celebrating the ongoing rollout of the election results, expressing vindication and confidence that Biden has bucked the historical trend of a dramatic pendulum swing in power from one party to another in the midterms.
Takeaways from the 2022 midterm elections: Battle for control of the House and Senate still up in the air
Biden followed a very different campaign strategy from Trump’s, opting to mix official presidential visits alongside Democratic candidates with small closed door political fundraisers or virtual events. He paid special attention to Pennsylvania – a nearby state where he has close ties that he visited more than a dozen times this election cycle.
While the president used the campaign trail to promote what he sees as the successes of his legislative agenda and Democrats’ efforts in Congress, he also sought to cast the midterms as a referendum on election denialism.
A week before the election, Biden delivered a speech from Washington castigating candidates up and down the ballot “who won’t commit to accepting the results of the elections they’re in,” blaming Trump for cultivating lies about the election that have evolved into conspiracies which have been adopted more broadly and have led to violence.
While the future majorities in Congress and many other key races have yet to be called, Trump’s long roster of endorsements included a long list of safe Republican seats, many of whom supported false claims about the 2020 presidential election and are all but guaranteed to win.

Russia's defense minister has ordered the withdrawal of Russian troops from the west bank of the Dnipro River in Kherson as Ukrainian forces make advances toward the city, according to state media.
President Volodymyr Zelensky told CNN that the Russia announcement may be a strategic move to regroup forces.
US President Joe Biden said he’s hopeful that with the midterm election over, President Vladimir Putin will be more willing to discuss the release of WNBA star Brittney Griner.
One of the most senior Russian-appointed officials in occupied Ukrainian territory has been killed in a road accident, according to the Russian-installed leader of the Kherson region.

Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu has ordered a withdrawal of Russian forces from the west bank of the Dnipro River in Kherson region, according to Russian state media.
His order comes as Ukrainian forces make advances toward the city of Kherson from two directions. 
The Russian withdrawal would be the most significant military development since Ukrainian forces swept through the northern Kharkiv region in September. 
Kherson was the first major Ukrainian city and the only regional capital that Russia has captured since the February invasion.

One of the most senior Russian-appointed officials in occupied Ukrainian territory has been killed, according to the Russian-installed leader of the Kherson region, Vladimir Saldo, and reported in Russian state news agencies.
“It is very hard for me to say that Kirill Stremousov died today. He died on the territory of the Kherson region, moving in a car that got into an accident,"" Saldo said in a statement on Telegram.
Saldo called Stremousov, the Russian-appointed deputy head of the region, ""one of the brightest, able to speak and present to people the truth about what is happening in the Kherson region.""
Stremousov died in a road accident, the press secretary of the head of the region said, according to Russian news agency TASS.
Russian state media company Vesti (VGTRK) said that, according to the Minister of Health of the Kherson Region Vadim Ilmiev, Stremousov was killed in an accident on the highway between Kherson and Armyansk in Crimea.
Valeria Petrusevich, head of the nonprofit organization Good Peace-Crimean Volunteers, also wrote on her Telegram channel that ""Kirill Stremousov, deputy governor of the Kherson region, died. The information is accurate, I know personally. It was an accident. Details later.""
Stremousov, a Ukrainian who was quick to side with the Russian occupation when Kherson fell early in the invasion, had become one of the most vocal and outspoken of Russian appointees.
As deputy head of the Kherson region military administration, Stremousov was prominent in organizing and supporting the referendum on Kherson's declared annexation by Russia and more recently had been the driving force in the evacuation of civilians from the west bank in Kherson, as Ukrainian forces pushed toward the Dnipro River.
On Tuesday, Stremousov said: “Most residents who decided to stay in Kherson are only now beginning to realize the gravity of the situation and my warnings.""
Stremousov frequently wrote on Telegram to describe Ukrainian officials and forces as ""Nazis"" and ""fascists."" But he was also critical of missteps by the Russian military. He had blamed the military setbacks in Kherson on “incompetent commanders” who had not been held accountable for their mistakes.
Sevastopol Gov. Mikhail Razvozhaev said that Stremousov ""was a true patriot of Russia, brave and courageous, in any situation he remained in touch and considered it his duty to inform the residents of the Kherson region about what was happening. This was the case this morning as well. This is an irreparable loss."" 
Earlier Wednesday, Stremousov had published a video on the situation on the front lines, particularly on the fighting around Snihurivska north of Kherson city, where there are reports that Ukrainian forces have broken through Russian defenses.
Stremousov was 45 years old, according to Vesti.

Russia destroys bridges in occupied Kherson region and appears to withdraw from some villages
From CNN's Olga Voitovych and Mick Krever in Kyiv
 Russian forces have destroyed bridges across occupied parts of Ukraine’s Kherson region west of the Dnipro River, a local Ukrainian official and Russian military analysts on Telegram reported on Wednesday.
Serhii Khlan, a member of the Ukrainian Kherson Regional Council, said that Russian forces appear to be staging a tactical retreat from some frontline villages to “slow down the onslaught of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.” CNN cannot independently confirm his claims.
“The occupiers blew up not only Dariivskyi and Tiahynskyi bridges, they also blew up the bridge at the exit from Snihurivka towards Kherson across the canal,” Khlan said during a press conference. “They blew up the bridge in Novokairy, blew up the bridge in Mylove.”
“The occupiers are now blowing up absolutely all bridges” in the occupied Kherson region west of the Dnipro River.
Images and reports from Russian propagandists and military analysts on Telegram appear to corroborate those claims. 
A popular Russian military analysis channel said Wednesday that “the destruction of bridges across the Kherson Front began to slow down the advance of the AFU [Armed Forces of Ukraine].”
Khlan said that Russian forces were withdrawing “en masse” from frontline villages along the western bank of the Dnipro River. He said that though it was not yet possible to officially say that Russia had abandoned the settlements, Russian forces were no longer present in Kachkarivka, Mylove, Novokairy, Berezynske, Sukhanove, Chervonyi Yar, Piatykhatky and Sadok.
“We must admit that the occupiers are running away, the occupiers are retreating,” Khlan said. “The most important task for them with the reinforced checkpoints that they are now doing in Niddniprianske, on the approaches to Kherson, and in Kozatske, on the approaches to Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant dam, is to ensure the withdrawal of their troops.”
There appears to have been fierce fighting around the Russian-occupied town of Snihurivka in the Mykolaiv region, just north of the Kherson region.
“As I understand, the occupiers are reinforcing [fortifications] in order to ensure the withdrawal of their units from the front line. We can say that under the onslaught of our Armed Forces, the occupiers are preparing and doing everything possible to make it look like a planned retreat from the front line, rather than an absolute failure of the front,” he said.

US: Griner's transfer to Russian penal colony is ""another injustice""

US Secretary of State Antony Blinken called Brittney Griner’s ongoing transfer to a remote penal colony in Russia “another injustice layered on her ongoing unjust and wrongful detention.”
“As we work to secure Brittney Griner’s release, we expect Russian authorities to provide our Embassy officials with regular access to all U.S. citizens detained in Russia, including Brittney, as is their obligation,” Blinken said in a statement Wednesday. “Ensuring the health and welfare of U.S. citizen detainees in Russia is a priority, and we will continue to press for fair and transparent treatment for them all.”
“Our hearts are with Brittney Griner and Paul Whelan, as well as their family, friends, and supporters, who all continue to suffer from Russia’s decision to wrongfully detain U.S. citizens,” the top US diplomat said.
“We continue to work relentlessly to bring them home. I am focused on doing so, as are so many others in the Department,” Blinken said. “We will not relent until they are reunited with their loved ones.”

It's mid-afternoon in Kyiv. Here's what you need to know
US basketball star Brittney Griner's location is currently unknown as she is moved to a Russian penal colony. Meanwhile, on the ground in Ukraine, a CNN team has reported heavy artillery exchanges in the Donetsk region.
Here are the latest developments:
Brittney Griner transfer: Representatives for the basketball star have confirmed they do not know her current location or condition after her attorneys said she was being transferred to a Russian penal colony on Wednesday. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said that the move is ""another injustice"" in her case.
Heavy gunfire in Donetsk: A CNN team visiting the town of Toretsk, near the frontline in eastern Ukraine’s Donetsk region, has reported hearing heavy exchanges of artillery. It comes after Zelensky said ""fierce positional battles"" are taking place in the region.
Hope for world's largest plane: Plans have been confirmed to rebuild the world's largest commercial plane, after it was destroyed at the start of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The massive aircraft was attacked at its base in Hostomel, near Kyiv, in February.
NATO summit location confirmed: The next NATO leaders summit will take place in Vilnius on July 11-12, the military alliance confirmed Wednesday. “It is expected that Finland and Sweden will participate in the summit as full-fledged members of the Alliance for the first time in Vilnius,” NATO said.

A basic military training course will be added to the Russian school curricula from the next academic year, Education Minister Sergey Kravtsov said Wednesday, according to state news agency TASS. 
""It will be introduced in schools starting from the next academic year. Now it is being drafted and after January 1, it will begin to be tested,"" Kravtsov told journalists, according to TASS.
The ministry had said earlier that a course for basic military training in schools and colleges was being developed, according to the news agency. 
The course would be part of the instruction time reserved for lessons on the basics of civil defense, which is 35 hours over five days, TASS said.

US midterm elections ""important"" but won’t change ""bad"" relations, says Kremlin
From CNN's Anna Chernova
The US midterm elections are ""important"" but the outcome won't have a significant impact on the Russia-US relations, which will likely ""remain bad,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Wednesday. 
“Of course, these elections are important, but I will probably not be mistaken if I say that there is no need to seriously exaggerate the significance of these elections in the short and medium term for the future of [Russia-US] bilateral relations,” Peskov said, according to state news agency RIA Novosti. 
“These elections cannot change anything essential. Relationships still exist and will remain bad,"" Peskov added.

Plans have been confirmed to rebuild the world's largest commercial plane, after the Antonov AN-225 was destroyed at the start of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
The massive aircraft, nicknamed ""Mriya"" -- Ukrainian for ""dream"" -- was attacked at its base in Hostomel, near Kyiv in February.
""Russia may have destroyed our 'Mriya'. But they will never be able to destroy our dream of a strong, free and democratic European state. We shall prevail!"" Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba wrote on Twitter at the time.
Now its manufacturers have announced that plans to rebuilt the aircraft are already underway.
The Antonov Company said in a tweet Monday that the rebuild project had begun, with ""design work"" in the offing.

The company predicted a bill of over €500 million ($502 million) to get it back in the air, promising more information ""after the victory.""
Already the company has around 30% of the components needed to build a new one, it announced.

Youngkin sent Pelosi a handwritten note apologizing for comments about attack on husband

Pelosi describes her experience following husband's attack that was intended for her

Washington
CNN
 — 
Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin sent a handwritten note of apology to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi for comments he made after the assault on her husband Paul Pelosi, her spokesperson told CNN.
The speaker has accepted the apology, the spokesperson said.
The letter, which was postmarked for November 1, came after the Virginia Republican said late last month, “Speaker Pelosi’s husband had a break-in last night in their house, and he was assaulted. There’s no room for violence anywhere, but we’re gonna send her back to be with him in California. That’s what we’re going to go do.”
Youngkin at the time was stumping for congressional candidate Yesli Vega just hours after the assault.
Punchbowl was first to report about the letter.
Youngkin, who drew criticism for the initial swipe at Pelosi, later expressed regret for making the comments.
“At the end of the day, I really wanted to express the fact that what happened to Speaker Pelosi’s husband was atrocious. And I didn’t do a great job,” he told Punchbowl News.
Paul Pelosi was attacked with a hammer at the couple’s home in San Francisco by a male assailant at the end of last month, authorities have said. The assailant was searching for the speaker of the House, according to court documents.
The violent attack on Paul Pelosi raised concerns over threats of political violence driven by partisan animosity and increasingly hostile political rhetoric, and highlighted the potential vulnerability of lawmakers and their families in the current political climate.
CNN’s Clare Foran and Chris Cillizza contributed to this report.

Magic wall: See where we are in undecided Senate races02:11
2022 midterm election results
By Adrienne Vogt, Aditi Sangal, Mike Hayes, Elise Hammond, Maureen Chowdhury, Tara Subramaniam, Melissa Macaya and Meg Wagner, CNN
Updated 11:29 PM ET, Fri November 11, 2022
What we're covering here
Control of the Senate and House still in the balance: All eyes are on undecided Arizona and Nevada Senate races, as Georgia's contest heads to a Dec. 6 runoff. At least 400,000 votes remain to be counted in Arizona's Maricopa County alone, officials said.
Democrats flip key Senate seat: Democrat John Fetterman flipped Pennsylvania's Senate seat, CNN projected, boosting Democratic hopes of keeping their majority. Both parties now need two seats to win control of the Senate.
Biden addresses the country: President Biden called the midterms a ""good day for America,"" noting that the ""giant red wave"" that was predicted didn't happen and that it's still possible that Democrats hold the House.
Historic firsts: Both parties are diversifying their ranks. Here's a look at the candidates CNN projects will make history.

Wisconsin's Milwaukee County and Dane County have counted all of their mail-in, early voting and same-day voting ballots, two county officials told CNN.
Milwaukee County has a population of about 950,000 people, with 595,000 of those people living in the city of Milwaukee, according to their county website.
Dane County has a population of about 560,000, according to the Census Bureau. It is also where Madison, one of the state’s major cities, is located.

Trump is ""livid"" after GOP midterms performance, adviser says 
From CNN's Jim Acosta and Dan Merica

Former President Donald Trump ""is livid” and “screaming at everyone” after last night’s disappointing GOP results in the midterms, a Trump adviser who has been in contact with Trump’s inner circle tells CNN. 
“Candidates matter,” the Trump adviser said. “They were all bad candidates,” the adviser continued, critiquing many of Trump’s handpicked contenders in key battleground states. 
This adviser said it’s unlikely Trump would delay his expected presidential announcement because “it’s too humiliating to delay.” But the adviser said there are too many unknowns at this point. 
The most striking loss for Trump came in Pennsylvania, where Republican Mehmet Oz fell to Democrat John Fetterman in what was the most expensive Senate race in the country. Trump endorsed Oz, during the contentious Republican primary, effectively pulling through a brutal primary and narrowly into the general election. But where the former president’s backing was decisive in the primary, it was an albatross in the general election for a Republican Senate candidate who was attempting to make inroads in the suburbs by touting his own moderation.
While Trump did score some Senate wins — Trump-backed GOP JD Vance defeated a stronger than expected challenge from Democrat Tim Ryan in the Ohio Senate race, while Republican Ted Budd defeated Democrat Cheri Beasley in North Carolina — those wins have so far been limited to clearly lean Republican states.
In the House, too, Trump acolytes lost in what were seen as competitive contests that Republicans needed to win if they were going to build a significant majority in the legislative body.
In New Hampshire, former Trump aide Karoline Leavitt lost to Democratic Rep. Chris Pappas in what was seen as a highly competitive contest. In North Carolina, Trump-backed Republican Bo Hines lost to Democrat Wiley Nickel in a race that was widely seen as a test of the former President’s influence. And in Ohio, Democratic state Rep. Emilia Sykes defeated Republican Madison Gesiotto Gilbert who bullishly touted her ties to Trump.
Trump’s evening was particularly bad when viewed through the lens of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ romp of a night.
DeSantis, Trump’s clearest rival for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, overwhelmingly won reelection on Tuesday, crushing Democrat Charlie Crist by nearly 20 percentage points, continuing to consolidate Latino support in Florida and even by winning populous counties like Miami-Dade.
The headline in Trump’s one-time hometown paper, the New York Post, said it all: “DeFUTURE,” the headline blared, showing the Florida Republican on stage with his family.

Stocks slip as control of Congress remains unclear
From CNN’s Paul R. La Monica
US stocks on Wednesday dipped modestly after the opening bell, with the Dow sliding nearly 200 points, or 0.6%. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq fell 0.7% and 0.9% respectively. 
Wall Street was betting on a red wave in the midterm elections Tuesday. But so far, it appears that didn't necessarily happen. 
The market had rallied the past three days, following a historic surge for stocks in October. That was due in part to expectations of a convincing victory for Republicans that could give the party control of one or both chambers of Congress — a development that could lead to more investor-friendly gridlock.

Georgia's Gwinnett County has a ""small number"" of ballots left to count 
From CNN's Katie Lobosco

All advance in-person, absentee-by-mail and Election Day results have been counted in Gwinnett County, Georgia, according to county media relations manager Deborah Tuff.
“That leaves a small number of provisional ballots, cures and some overseas ballots,” she said in an email to CNN Wednesday morning.
Tuff will provide an estimate of when those ballots will be counted later Wednesday. 
Gwinnett County is located about 30 miles northeast of Atlanta. 
Meanwhile, in Georgia's Columbia County, all mail-in, early voting and same-day voting ballots have been counted, according to Columbia County Director of the Board of Elections Nancy Gay. The county is in eastern Georgia near Augusta.
There are 52 provisional ballots left to research and determine if they can be counted or not and an unknown number of military ballots left to count, Gay said.

CNN Projection: Kentucky rejects adding amendment that would further restrict abortion rights
From CNN’s Veronica Stracqualursi and Devan Cole 
Kentucky voters on Tuesday rejected a proposal to amend the state’s constitution to say that it does not ""secure or protect a right"" to abortion or the funding of abortion, CNN projects. 
If adopted, the measure would have gone into effect immediately once the results of the election are certified by the State Board of Elections. 
The ballot question voters faced read: ""Are you in favor of amending the Constitution of Kentucky by creating a new Section of the Constitution to be numbered Section 26A to state as follows: To protect human life, nothing in this Constitution shall be construed to secure or protect a right to abortion or require the funding of abortion?"" 
Kentucky's ""trigger law,"" which bans most abortions at all stages of pregnancy, and a law banning abortion after roughly six weeks of pregnancy have been allowed to be enforced temporarily while a lawsuit challenging the laws continues. 
Kentucky Right to Life executive director Addia Wuchner, who chairs the Yes for Life Alliance which supported Amendment 2, previously said voting ""yes"" would ""ensure there's no false interpretation of the constitution."" 
Without the amendment, ""instead of the lawmakers who duly reflect the people's will, we would end up with the abortion industry taking each law back into court,"" Wuchner said. 
Tamarra Wieder, the Kentucky state director for Planned Parenthood Alliance Advocates, had said passing the amendment would ""open the door to more attacks on abortion access,"" but rejecting it would allow abortion rights advocates to ""continue to fight back"" against the six-week ban and the trigger ban.

Rep. Nancy Mace says she is ""cautiously optimistic"" GOP will take majority in the House
From CNN's Allie Malloy

GOP Rep. Nancy Mace told CNN she is “cautiously optimistic” that Republicans will win a majority in the House of Representatives, adding that until both parties reach across the aisle it will be “difficult for anyone to govern.” 
Mace also acknowledged she expected her Republican colleagues to perform better than they did Tuesday.
“I was seeing the turnout that we had. I thought that’s how the rest of the country was, but I see my district as a bellwether, and I worked hard to let people know that I stood with my party on most things but I also stood against my party on other issues,” she told CNN.
Mace also said she did not support “at this juncture” any effort to impeach President Joe Biden if the GOP does take the House of Representatives. 
“That’s not something I support at this juncture without a heavy investigation. Impeachment has been weaponized over the years – and we’ve seen that in the last five years or so. We need to really focus on economic issues,” Mace said Wednesday.

Georgia Senate runoff election

Democrats flip key Senate seat: Democrat John Fetterman flipped Pennsylvania's Senate seat, CNN projected, boosting Democratic hopes of keeping their majority. Both parties now need two seats to win control of the Senate.
Biden addresses the country: President Biden called the midterms a ""good day for America,"" noting that the ""giant red wave"" that was predicted didn't happen and that it's still possible that Democrats hold the House.

Wisconsin's Milwaukee County and Dane County have counted all of their mail-in, early voting and same-day voting ballots, two county officials told CNN.
Milwaukee County has a population of about 950,000 people, with 595,000 of those people living in the city of Milwaukee, according to their county website.
Dane County has a population of about 560,000, according to the Census Bureau. It is also where Madison, one of the state’s major cities, is located.

Trump is ""livid"" after GOP midterms performance, adviser says 
From CNN's Jim Acosta and Dan Merica

Former President Donald Trump ""is livid” and “screaming at everyone” after last night’s disappointing GOP results in the midterms, a Trump adviser who has been in contact with Trump’s inner circle tells CNN. 
“Candidates matter,” the Trump adviser said. “They were all bad candidates,” the adviser continued, critiquing many of Trump’s handpicked contenders in key battleground states. 
This adviser said it’s unlikely Trump would delay his expected presidential announcement because “it’s too humiliating to delay.” But the adviser said there are too many unknowns at this point. 
The most striking loss for Trump came in Pennsylvania, where Republican Mehmet Oz fell to Democrat John Fetterman in what was the most expensive Senate race in the country. Trump endorsed Oz, during the contentious Republican primary, effectively pulling through a brutal primary and narrowly into the general election. But where the former president’s backing was decisive in the primary, it was an albatross in the general election for a Republican Senate candidate who was attempting to make inroads in the suburbs by touting his own moderation.
While Trump did score some Senate wins — Trump-backed GOP JD Vance defeated a stronger than expected challenge from Democrat Tim Ryan in the Ohio Senate race, while Republican Ted Budd defeated Democrat Cheri Beasley in North Carolina — those wins have so far been limited to clearly lean Republican states.
In the House, too, Trump acolytes lost in what were seen as competitive contests that Republicans needed to win if they were going to build a significant majority in the legislative body.
In New Hampshire, former Trump aide Karoline Leavitt lost to Democratic Rep. Chris Pappas in what was seen as a highly competitive contest. In North Carolina, Trump-backed Republican Bo Hines lost to Democrat Wiley Nickel in a race that was widely seen as a test of the former President’s influence. And in Ohio, Democratic state Rep. Emilia Sykes defeated Republican Madison Gesiotto Gilbert who bullishly touted her ties to Trump.
Trump’s evening was particularly bad when viewed through the lens of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ romp of a night.
DeSantis, Trump’s clearest rival for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, overwhelmingly won reelection on Tuesday, crushing Democrat Charlie Crist by nearly 20 percentage points, continuing to consolidate Latino support in Florida and even by winning populous counties like Miami-Dade.
The headline in Trump’s one-time hometown paper, the New York Post, said it all: “DeFUTURE,” the headline blared, showing the Florida Republican on stage with his family.

Stocks slip as control of Congress remains unclear
From CNN’s Paul R. La Monica
US stocks on Wednesday dipped modestly after the opening bell, with the Dow sliding nearly 200 points, or 0.6%. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq fell 0.7% and 0.9% respectively. 
Wall Street was betting on a red wave in the midterm elections Tuesday. But so far, it appears that didn't necessarily happen. 
The market had rallied the past three days, following a historic surge for stocks in October. That was due in part to expectations of a convincing victory for Republicans that could give the party control of one or both chambers of Congress — a development that could lead to more investor-friendly gridlock.

Georgia's Gwinnett County has a ""small number"" of ballots left to count

All advance in-person, absentee-by-mail and Election Day results have been counted in Gwinnett County, Georgia, according to county media relations manager Deborah Tuff.
“That leaves a small number of provisional ballots, cures and some overseas ballots,” she said in an email to CNN Wednesday morning.
Tuff will provide an estimate of when those ballots will be counted later Wednesday. 
Gwinnett County is located about 30 miles northeast of Atlanta. 
Meanwhile, in Georgia's Columbia County, all mail-in, early voting and same-day voting ballots have been counted, according to Columbia County Director of the Board of Elections Nancy Gay. The county is in eastern Georgia near Augusta.
There are 52 provisional ballots left to research and determine if they can be counted or not and an unknown number of military ballots left to count, Gay said.
CNN's Ellie Kaufman contributed reporting to this post.

CNN Projection: Kentucky rejects adding amendment that would further restrict abortion rights
From CNN’s Veronica Stracqualursi and Devan Cole 
Kentucky voters on Tuesday rejected a proposal to amend the state’s constitution to say that it does not ""secure or protect a right"" to abortion or the funding of abortion, CNN projects. 
If adopted, the measure would have gone into effect immediately once the results of the election are certified by the State Board of Elections. 
The ballot question voters faced read: ""Are you in favor of amending the Constitution of Kentucky by creating a new Section of the Constitution to be numbered Section 26A to state as follows: To protect human life, nothing in this Constitution shall be construed to secure or protect a right to abortion or require the funding of abortion?"" 
Kentucky's ""trigger law,"" which bans most abortions at all stages of pregnancy, and a law banning abortion after roughly six weeks of pregnancy have been allowed to be enforced temporarily while a lawsuit challenging the laws continues. 
Kentucky Right to Life executive director Addia Wuchner, who chairs the Yes for Life Alliance which supported Amendment 2, previously said voting ""yes"" would ""ensure there's no false interpretation of the constitution."" 
Without the amendment, ""instead of the lawmakers who duly reflect the people's will, we would end up with the abortion industry taking each law back into court,"" Wuchner said. 
Tamarra Wieder, the Kentucky state director for Planned Parenthood Alliance Advocates, had said passing the amendment would ""open the door to more attacks on abortion access,"" but rejecting it would allow abortion rights advocates to ""continue to fight back"" against the six-week ban and the trigger ban.

Rep. Nancy Mace says she is ""cautiously optimistic"" GOP will take majority in the House

GOP Rep. Nancy Mace told CNN she is “cautiously optimistic” that Republicans will win a majority in the House of Representatives, adding that until both parties reach across the aisle it will be “difficult for anyone to govern.” 
Mace also acknowledged she expected her Republican colleagues to perform better than they did Tuesday.
“I was seeing the turnout that we had. I thought that’s how the rest of the country was, but I see my district as a bellwether, and I worked hard to let people know that I stood with my party on most things but I also stood against my party on other issues,” she told CNN.
Mace also said she did not support “at this juncture” any effort to impeach President Joe Biden if the GOP does take the House of Representatives. 
“That’s not something I support at this juncture without a heavy investigation. Impeachment has been weaponized over the years – and we’ve seen that in the last five years or so. We need to really focus on economic issues,” Mace said Wednesday.

The Oz campaign has not made a public concession or statement so far after projected loss

As of early Wednesday morning, Republican Mehmet Oz has not publicly conceded after his projected loss to Democratic Lt. Gov. John Fetterman in the race for Senate in Pennsylvania. 
The silence from the candidate and staff is noteworthy. 
After repeated attempts to get in touch with the campaign, no comment or details on a statement from the candidate — written or verbal — have been confirmed. 
Oz spoke at his campaign headquarters in Bucks County late Tuesday before the race was projected, saying to the crowd, “When all the ballots are counted, we believe we will win this race.”

CNN Projection: Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel will win reelection 
From CNN staff

Democratic Attorney General Dana Nessel will be reelected, CNN projects, and defeat Republican Matthew DePerno. 
DePerno was a leader in the efforts to challenge Michigan’s 2020 election results, including by filing a lawsuit claiming vote fraud in Antrim County. While the suit failed and DePerno’s theories about Dominion voting machines have been thoroughly debunked, he pledges to “prosecute the people who corrupted the 2020 election.”

Four Senate races must still be called, but only one offers a chance of a rematch: Georgia.
As day breaks the morning after the election, the campaigns of Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock and Republican challenger Herschel Walker are starting to prepare for one more month of campaigning – not waiting for a runoff to be formally called by state election officials.
Both candidates are expected to speak later today, aides say, with specific plans still in flux.
Top officials from the Democratic and Republican parties also tell CNN they intend to double down on their significant investments in Georgia, with an increasing assumption that control of the Senate could hinge on the outcome of a likely Dec. 6 runoff.
While Warnock holds a narrow edge over Walker of about 18,000 votes – out of more than 4 million ballots cast – Republican officials are alarmed by another tally from election night: Walker’s underperformance compared to Gov. Brian Kemp. 
In his reelection victory, Kemp performed far stronger than Walker in suburban areas, earning about 163,000 more votes than Walker.
Georgia election official Gabriel Sterling told CNN that the state’s secretary of state office began making preparations last night for a runoff in the US Senate race. Preparations include building ballots and pushing proofs to counties starting Monday.
So far, neither candidate has reached the 50 percent needed to avoid a runoff, which makes a runoff a very real possibility.

From CNN's Aditi Sangal

There are at approximately 300,000 ballots left to be counted in Maricopa County, Board of Supervisors Bill Gates told ""CNN This Morning"" on Wednesday.
Approximately 17,000 ballots from Election Day, not including mail-in ballots, have yet to be counted, Gates said. Those ballots comprise roughly 7% of ballots that went into “Box 3,” meaning “they were not run through the tabulator there at the vote center, but they are secure and they will be tabulated in our central count facility,” Gates said.
In addition, there are 90,000 mail-in ballots that were received after Friday but before Tuesday that have not been counted, and approximately 200,000 mail-in ballots received Tuesday that also have yet to be counted, Gates told CNN This Morning. 
He noted that they do not have a precise count of how many mail in ballots were received Tuesday, but said the roughly 200,000 “all came in late last night.”
Gates stressed that voters in Maricopa County “should not be concerned” about their votes being counted after a technical issue, telling CNN that the bottom line is that “everyone who showed up yesterday with a valid ID…they had the opportunity to vote a ballot and that vote is going to count.”
""Because of the great work of our poll workers and our technicians to determine what the issue was, we were able to get those tabulators back online,"" he said. ""Everyone who showed up yesterday with a valid ID — because we have a voter ID law here in Arizona — they had the opportunity to vote a ballot, and that vote is going to be counted.""

Election Day is over but many of the fundamental races of this election cycle remain uncalled.
Gubernatorial races in Alaska, Arizona, Kansas, Nevada and Oregon have yet to be called. And as the country begins to look towards 2024, the management of future elections in three key states remains unclear, with the races for Secretary of State in Arizona, Nevada and Wisconsin ongoing. 
When it comes to Congress, control of both the House and Senate is still up for grabs.
In the Senate, Lt. Gov. John Fetterman's victory in Pennsylvania, flipping a GOP seat, gave Democrats a sigh of relief as they await results from Arizona, Nevada, Wisconsin and Georgia. Republicans need to win three of those four to claim a majority.
The shape of the House, too, remains uncertain.
Here are the remaining races, whose outcomes will determine which party controls the chambers:
SENATE
Arizona: With 67% of votes in, the incumbent Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly is ahead of Republican Blake Masters by 107,883 votes.
Georgia: With 96% of votes in, the incumbent Democrat Rev. Raphael Warnockleads Republican Herschel Walker by 18,043 votes. 
Nevada: With 80% of votes in, Republican Adam Laxalt is ahead of incumbent Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto by 22,595 votes.
Wisconsin: With 94% of votes in, the incumbent Republican Sen. Ron Johnson leads Mandela Barnes, a Democrat, by 32,879 votes. 
Alaska: With 67% of votes in, Kelly Tshibaka, a Republican, leads the incumbent Sen. Lisa Murkowski, also a Republican, by 3,196 votes.
HOUSE

Congress' 1st Gen Z representative says he and Biden shared experience of being elected young on call

The first member of Gen Z who is heading to Congress, 25-year-old Florida Representative-elect Maxwell Alejandro Frost, said that he and President Joe Biden bonded on a call about the president also first being elected at a young age.
Frost has received calls from Biden and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi after his projected win in Florida's 10th District.
He and Biden discussed how the president was elected to the Senate when he was 29 years old and how had to wait until after his 30th birthday to be sworn in.
""He asked me if it was the same situation. I said 'no, Mr. President, you have me beat on that. I'm already old enough to be sworn in on Jan. 3.' It was great to talk to him. He was elected at a very young age, too, and so he understands that experience,"" he told CNN's Poppy Harlow.
Generation Z refers to those born after 1996. Frost will succeed Democrat Val Demings, who vacated the seat to run for Senate.
Frost said when organizers in Orlando first approached him about running last year, his first reaction was ""no,"" but he told CNN that a call to his biological mother changed that.
""I was at a crossroads. ... Hearing that she had me at the most vulnerable point in her life really reaffirmed what I believe in and why I ran for Congress,"" he said.
Frost said he wants to push for gun violence legislation, including universal background checks.
When asked about Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis winning a resounding reelection victory, Frost said, ""What we saw was not a red wave. ... What we saw is there was a blue deficit. Democrats did not turn out the way they needed to. And I think as Democrats, we need to have year-round organizing.""

President Biden and his advisers are in a particularly good mood about one candidate who scored a major victory overnight: John Fetterman. 
The Pennsylvania lieutenant governor was in one of the most closely watched Senate races of the cycle, and ultimately defeated celebrity doctor Mehmet Oz. Biden texted Fetterman to congratulate him, and a White House official even made a rare comment on this specific win: “The president had a great time with the senator-elect on Saturday,” a White House official told CNN overnight.
That comment served as a reminder, of course, that the president had campaigned alongside Fetterman in Pennsylvania in the final stretch of the midterms. That move had stood out because towards the very end, Biden was sticking to safer, blue states such as New York, Maryland and California.
In the end, one of the most important Senate race results of the election was Democrats picking up a Senate seat in Pennsylvania where both Biden and former President Barack Obama went all out in the end – efforts that ultimately could have made a difference in Fetterman’s favor."

The Iowa teen who killed her alleged rapist and escaped from a residential corrections facility is back in custody

 — 
Pieper Lewis, the Iowa teen and sex trafficking victim who killed a man she said raped her multiple times, is back in custody following her escape from the residential corrections facility where she was serving probation, according to the Polk County Sheriff’s Office.
Lewis, 18, was arrested just days after she walked away from the Des Moines women’s center where she’d been sent as part of a deferred judgment she received after pleading guilty to voluntary manslaughter and willful injury in the 2020 killing of 37-year-old Zachary Brooks. Lewis was 15 at the time.
Lewis was found in Des Moines and taken back into custody Tuesday, the Iowa Department of Corrections said in a statement. The teenager is being held at the Polk County Jail, said Lt. Ryan Evans of the sheriff’s office, who told CNN she was expected to have a future court date for violating her probation.
Lewis went missing early Friday, November 4, when she cut off an electronic monitoring device and left the Fresh Start Women’s Center, Jerry Evans, the executive director of the Fifth Judicial District Department of Corrections, previously told CNN.
When she left, authorities filed a “probation violation report,” Evans told CNN, “recommending revocation of her probation” and requesting a warrant for her arrest.
The probation violation report said an alarm sounded at the facility at 6:19 a.m., notifying staff a door had been opened. A residential officer then saw Lewis exiting the facility through a door, according to the report obtained by CNN.
Iowa teen ordered to pay her alleged rapist's family $150,000 is not the first sex trafficking victim penalized for killing their alleged assaulter
The report, which was signed by a probation officer and a residential supervisor, goes on to request the warrant for Lewis’ arrest, adding, “It is further ordered that her deferred judgments (be) revoked and original sentence imposed.”
Lewis became a resident at the Fresh Start Women’s Center after pleading guilty in Brooks’ killing, saying in her plea agreement he raped her multiple times.
She originally faced up to 20 years in prison. But in September, Polk County District Judge David Porter handed down a deferred judgment, meaning the plea could be expunged if she completed the probationary sentence at the residential correctional facility.
Under Iowa law, the court additionally had to order Lewis to pay a $150,000 restitution fee to Brooks’ family, the judge said. He also ruled she should serve 200 hours of community service and pay more than $4,000 in civil penalties.
In the plea agreement, Lewis outlined for the court the series of events that she said led up to the killing, beginning with her running away from home due to what she said was an abusive environment. She was eventually taken in by a man who she said trafficked her, forcing her to have sex with other men in exchange for money. Brooks was one of those men, according to Lewis, who described in her agreement being repeatedly assaulted, including while she was unconscious.
On May 31, 2020, the man with whom Lewis lived confronted her with a knife and forced her to go to Brooks’ apartment, where Lewis said she was forced to drink vodka and eventually fell asleep. At one point, she woke up to find Brooks was raping her, she said.
Later, Brooks fell asleep and Lewis, “overcome with rage” at the realization he had raped her again, “immediately grabbed the knife from his nightstand and began stabbing him,” she said in the plea agreement.
Lewis’ attorney was pleased with the deferred judgment, but advocates for victims of sexual violence voiced concern about her ability to serve the sentence, pointing to the extent of her trauma.
They also highlighted how her case echoed other recent cases in the US in which teenagers – often people of color – have been legally penalized or convicted of killing their sex trafficker or assaulter.

Magic wall: See where we are in undecided Senate races02:11
2022 midterm election results
By Adrienne Vogt, Aditi Sangal, Mike Hayes, Elise Hammond, Maureen Chowdhury, Tara Subramaniam, Melissa Macaya and Meg Wagner, CNN
Updated 11:29 PM ET, Fri November 11, 2022
What we're covering here
Control of the Senate and House still in the balance: All eyes are on undecided Arizona and Nevada Senate races, as Georgia's contest heads to a Dec. 6 runoff. At least 400,000 votes remain to be counted in Arizona's Maricopa County alone, officials said.
Democrats flip key Senate seat: Democrat John Fetterman flipped Pennsylvania's Senate seat, CNN projected, boosting Democratic hopes of keeping their majority. Both parties now need two seats to win control of the Senate.
Biden addresses the country: President Biden called the midterms a ""good day for America,"" noting that the ""giant red wave"" that was predicted didn't happen and that it's still possible that Democrats hold the House.
Historic firsts: Both parties are diversifying their ranks. Here's a look at the candidates CNN projects will make history.

The morning after the election, here are the remaining Senate and House races to watch

Election Day is over but many of the fundamental races of this election cycle remain uncalled.
Gubernatorial races in Alaska, Arizona, Kansas, Nevada and Oregon have yet to be called. And as the country begins to look towards 2024, the management of future elections in three key states remains unclear, with the races for Secretary of State in Arizona, Nevada and Wisconsin ongoing. 
When it comes to Congress, control of both the House and Senate is still up for grabs.
In the Senate, Lt. Gov. John Fetterman's victory in Pennsylvania, flipping a GOP seat, gave Democrats a sigh of relief as they await results from Arizona, Nevada, Wisconsin and Georgia. Republicans need to win three of those four to claim a majority.
The shape of the House, too, remains uncertain.
Here are the remaining races, whose outcomes will determine which party controls the chambers:
SENATE
Arizona: With 67% of votes in, the incumbent Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly is ahead of Republican Blake Masters by 107,883 votes.
Georgia: With 96% of votes in, the incumbent Democrat Rev. Raphael Warnockleads Republican Herschel Walker by 18,043 votes. 
Nevada: With 80% of votes in, Republican Adam Laxalt is ahead of incumbent Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto by 22,595 votes.
Wisconsin: With 94% of votes in, the incumbent Republican Sen. Ron Johnson leads Mandela Barnes, a Democrat, by 32,879 votes. 
Alaska: With 67% of votes in, Kelly Tshibaka, a Republican, leads the incumbent Sen. Lisa Murkowski, also a Republican, by 3,196 votes.
HOUSE

Congress' 1st Gen Z representative says he and Biden shared experience of being elected young on call

The first member of Gen Z who is heading to Congress, 25-year-old Florida Representative-elect Maxwell Alejandro Frost, said that he and President Joe Biden bonded on a call about the president also first being elected at a young age.
Frost has received calls from Biden and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi after his projected win in Florida's 10th District.
He and Biden discussed how the president was elected to the Senate when he was 29 years old and how had to wait until after his 30th birthday to be sworn in.
""He asked me if it was the same situation. I said 'no, Mr. President, you have me beat on that. I'm already old enough to be sworn in on Jan. 3.' It was great to talk to him. He was elected at a very young age, too, and so he understands that experience,"" he told CNN's Poppy Harlow.
Generation Z refers to those born after 1996. Frost will succeed Democrat Val Demings, who vacated the seat to run for Senate.
Frost said when organizers in Orlando first approached him about running last year, his first reaction was ""no,"" but he told CNN that a call to his biological mother changed that.
""I was at a crossroads. ... Hearing that she had me at the most vulnerable point in her life really reaffirmed what I believe in and why I ran for Congress,"" he said.
Frost said he wants to push for gun violence legislation, including universal background checks.
When asked about Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis winning a resounding reelection victory, Frost said, ""What we saw was not a red wave. ... What we saw is there was a blue deficit. Democrats did not turn out the way they needed to. And I think as Democrats, we need to have year-round organizing.""

Biden world is in especially good mood about Fetterman's win in Pennsylvania Senate race

Biden world feeling vindicated that abortion and protecting democracy were serious motivators for voters
From CNN's MJ Lee
In the final stretch of the midterms, President Biden and his White House were starting to be on the receiving end of a whole lot of criticism that went something like this: Why wasn’t the president focusing solely on the economy when it is the top, overwhelming issue for most voters?
That criticism took aim at the fact that Biden and his advisers were choosing to spend a good amount of effort and time in the final stretch discussing abortion rights and issues related to protecting democracy and election integrity. This included a major evening speech by the president last week in Washington, DC, in the aftermath of a violent attack against House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s husband. 
The morning after the election, Biden advisers say they feel even more vindicated on their messaging decisions – pointing to various exit polls that indicate yes, the economy was a huge motivator for voters – but so were other issues such as abortion and protecting democracy.
Even as they wait to learn what the balance of Congress will ultimately be, Biden advisers say some of the most important bright spots around the country that they’ve isolated are ballot initiatives aimed at protecting abortion rights.

Georgia's GOP lt. governor: Republicans are waking up wishing they ""picked a better candidate"" than Walker
From CNN's Aditi Sangal

Georgia's Republican Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan lamented on Wednesday that the GOP Senate candidate in Georgia was Herschel Walker.
""I think a lot of Republicans like me are waking up this morning going 'what could have been if we picked a better candidate that could have won with a margin like Brian Kemp that would have been able to put real leadership on display, real ideas on display, win the hearts and minds of Georgians, and get the state back to fully red?'"" he told CNN.
""I think it sends a message to the country, along with other states, that this is a pivot point for the Republican Party. This is a time that Donald Trump is, no doubt, in the rear view mirror. It's time to move on with the party, it's time to move on with candidate quality,"" Duncan added. ""If they would have just woke up 12 months ago and stopped taking [Trump's] lead and took the lead of what real Republicans, real Republican policies mattered, we'd be in a different place."" 
Duncan has been a critic of Trump for some time now, urging Republican leaders and voters to move on from the former president.
""I think Donald Trump's moving from a movement to a distraction for the Republican Party now,"" Duncan told CNN Wednesday.

Former Trump aide: ""Last night was the biggest indicator"" that Trump should not be the GOP nominee in 2024
From CNN's Aditi Sangal

Former Trump aide Sarah Matthews says the way 2022 Election Night went indicates that Donald Trump is costing Republicans winnable seats. In the walkup to midterm elections, the Republicans had hoped that they would have clear majority in the House of Representatives on Election Night.
However, as of Wednesday morning, the results are still coming and the control of Congress still hangs in the balance.
""I think last night was the biggest indicator that Donald Trump should not be the Republican nominee in 2024. He cost Republicans winnable seats by boosting poor quality candidates,"" said Matthews, former deputy White House press secretary under President Trump.
She added: ""You have record inflation, increased fears over crime, the worst border crisis in history, an unpopular president and Republican performance was still underwhelming. And that was in large part due to the candidates that Trump backed. They weren't up to quality. I think this is lessons learned for Republicans that a, Trump is not a national winner, and, b, candidate quality matters.""
CNN analyst Harry Enten explained this through the numbers.
""Donald Trump is not a well-liked politician,"" he said Wednesday, pointing to Trump's favorability standing at 39%.
People who held an unfavorable view of Trump voted overwhelmingly for Democrats in this election, Enten explained. ""Basically, those people who said they voted for Biden two years ago, stuck by the Democratic candidates for the House. And this was despite the fact look how unpopular Joe Biden was.""

3 female politicians visited Susan B. Anthony’s gravesite as tradition with their ""I Voted Today"" stickers
From CNN’s Tavleen Tarrant
It was 150 years ago this year that noted suffragette and voting rights activist Susan B. Anthony illegally cast her vote in her hometown of Rochester, New York. She was arrested, and then convicted for voting illegally. Nearly 50 years later, after the 19th amendment passed on June 4, 1919, White women like Anthony were legally granted the right to vote.
On Tuesday, women and men paid tribute to Anthony's trailblazing efforts by visiting her final resting place and leaving their “I Voted Today” stickers on her gravestone after voting in the 2022 midterm elections. It's been a local Rochester tradition for years now to visit the site at Mount Hope Cemetery, also the resting place of abolitionist Fredrick Douglass, on Election Day.
New York State Senator Samra Brouk, and Assemblymembers Sarah Clark and Jennifer Lunsford held a rally this year where supporters marched from Anthony's home to the nearest polling station in an effort to encourage women to vote in this year's midterm election.
""With all that’s going on with rights for women right now, and our ability to make decisions on our own bodies and healthcare eroding, it's important for us to show up and vote,"" Clark said.
""This year women in particular are seeing what happens if we are getting lackadaisical about our rights,” Lunsford said. “We are at risk of losing what we take for granted. Following the reversal of Roe v Wade, this has become more evident than ever.""
Clark has been leaving her “I Voted Today” sticker at Anthony’s gravestone since 2016 when, like many others, she braved the long line to get a chance to place her sticker on the women’s right’s advocate’s gravestone in honor of Hilary Clinton.
On Tuesday, six years on, Clark visited the gravesite to place that sticker on Anthony's tombstone once again, as is Rochester tradition.
The headstone looks a little different than it did in 2016. For one, it's under a plastic cover protecting the grave marker being damaged from the myriad of stickers that often get placed on it every election cycle. There's also no throng of people waiting in line at the gravesite like in 2016.
Clark said 120 people marched and voted to commemorate the 150th anniversary of Susan B. Anthony’s historic vote. The assemblywoman said they handed out “I Voted When She Voted” stickers to all march-goers who voted. The hashtag #SusanBAnthony on social media shows women posting photos of their ""I Voted Today"" sticker on Anthony’s headstone.

Biden appears to avoid the midterm Democratic purge many in his party feared
From CNN's MJ Lee

As many in the country were going to bed last night, President Biden and his advisers – up late into the night watching the midterm returns come in — felt convinced of two things: Races across the board looked competitive, and Democrats appeared to have avoided a bloodbath that some had predicted and feared.
The White House wakes up this morning to real reasons for that optimism from the previous night to continue: The possibility of Democrats’ keeping the Senate in their hands very much remains intact, and they’ve seen Democratic governors of big swing states and key House frontliners in their party win their races.
A huge outstanding question, of course, remains the fate of the House – and just how many seats Republicans will ultimately end up picking up. 
Whether Democrats can keep control of the Senate – and how the makeup of the House will ultimately shake out – will have huge implications for President Biden and his party’s ability to govern in the second half of his first term.
And as the White House is poised to highlight some of the bright spots from last night’s results, a challenge for them will be whether they can successfully make the case that some of these Democrats were able to hold their own because of the White House and President Biden – not in spite of them.
Leading up to Election Day, there was already starting to be plenty of finger-pointing at the White House. Some House Democrats, for example, told CNN that Biden and his team failed to drive hard at an economic message, at a moment when voters have made clear that it is overwhelmingly their most important issue.
One progressive House member put it bluntly to CNN: “We knew the economy would be bad… and they didn’t have an economic message at all.”
The lawmaker lamented – echoing sentiments expressed by some of their colleagues – that they also didn’t see the White House adequately take credit for Democrats’ legislative wins, including last year’s passage of a major bipartisan infrastructure bill. It was a “total failure to take a victory lap,” they said. 
But if many Democrats were ready to start playing the blame game, the results so far could have bought everyone some breathing room – the White House most of all —at least for a few days.
White House officials have insisted in the final stretch of the midterms that Biden has consistently discussed the economy and made economic issues key to his political messaging.
They’ve also made clear that they believe voters are considering a range of issues as they head to ballot boxes – and not just the economy – and that it was critical for the leader of the Democratic Party to publicly discuss issues like abortion rights, gun safety and protecting democracy, which they believe have played major roles in animating the Democratic base.
The thinking goes like this – it would have been unthinkable for Biden to have not addressed the state of women’s reproductive rights in this country after the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe; similarly, there was no scenario in which the president would have neglected to speak out publicly against election deniers and threats and acts and politically motivated violence, when it was plainly obvious to him just how serious these issues were this election cycle.
While the exact timing and plans remain in flux, Biden is expected to address the election results in some form on Wednesday."

Five baseless 2022 election conspiracy theories, fact-checked
By CNN staff
Updated 12:00 AM EST, Wed November 9, 2022
Some social media users claim this video is evidence of voter fraud. CNN's Donie O'Sullivan explains why it is misinformation

CNN
 — 
False claims and conspiracy theories about voting and the election process swirled on social media as Americans cast their ballots on Tuesday.
The disinformation was driven by Republicans. Former President Donald Trump and other prominent right-wing figures seized on technical problems in some key states to baselessly suggest there had been intentional malfeasance. Trump also made a baseless claim of mass voter fraud.
Here is a look at some of the early false and misleading claims. This article will be updated as CNN fact-checks additional claims.
With no evidence, Trump floats the possibility of mass voter fraud in the midterms
Trump, who has repeatedly and falsely alleged that there was mass voter fraud in the 2020 election, baselessly suggested on social media on Tuesday that such fraud might be happening in the 2022 midterms.
“Same thing is happening with Voter Fraud as happened in 2020???” the former president wrote Tuesday afternoon on his Truth Social platform.
There was no evidence of widespread or outcome-changing voter fraud in the 2020 election, and there was no early sign on Tuesday of any significant voter fraud in the 2022 midterms. Voter fraud typically represents a tiny fraction of ballots cast in US elections.
Trump made his Tuesday claim amid a series of social media posts in which he complained about assorted technical difficulties in some states. There was no evidence that any of these issues involved intentional malfeasance, let alone “voter fraud.”

Maricopa County debunks Republican’s false tweet about wait times
Maricopa County, the most populous county in Arizona, has tweeted a debunking of a prominent Republican personality’s false Election Day claim about voting wait times.
Charlie Kirk, the founder and president of right-wing group Turning Point USA, tweeted Tuesday to his 1.8 million followers: “2 hour wait minimum at most polling places in Maricopa. Democrats running elections here knew this would happen. Traffic jam by design. DONT LET THEM DO 2020 AGAIN. WAIT IN LINE AND VOTE.”
The tweet was thoroughly inaccurate.
Maricopa County’s elections aren’t run by Democrats: its elections chief, Recorder Stephen Richer, and its Board of Supervisors chairman, Bill Gates, are both Republicans. And the county’s online wait-times tracker showed that dozens of voting locations there had waits of under five minutes, including many with no waits at all. County voters are permitted to cast their ballots at whatever location they choose.
Maricopa County did experience Election Day technical problems with tabulation devices at about 20% of its voting locations, according to county officials on Tuesday morning. The problem prompted officials to ask affected voters to place their ballot in a secure box for counting, wait for the tabulator problems to be resolved, or go vote at another county location. (Richer issued an afternoon statement saying the Board of Supervisors had identified the problem and had “begun fixing affected voting locations.” He promised that “every legal vote will be tabulated.”)
But there was no indication of intentional malfeasance.
Maricopa County said in its tweet in response to Kirk’s tweet: “No part of the tweet below is accurate. The vast majority of Vote Centers are seeing wait times under 30 minutes, and whether by tabulator or secure ballot box, all voters are being served.”
–Daniel Dale
Conspiracy theorists call for voters to ‘check for WiFi’
Conspiracy theorists are warning voters to “check for WiFi” network names and connections inside and outside of their polling locations, a new iteration of the debunked conspiracy that voting machines are connected to the internet and can change votes remotely.
“Check for Wifi connections, both inside & outside poll locations. Election machines should not be connected to the Internet. Take a screenshot to report irregularities for investigation,” read one tweet.
The calls on social media sites such as Telegram and Twitter echo previous debunked conspiracy theories that voting machines are connected to the internet, thus allowing for tampering by third-party saboteurs or election officials to change votes from one candidate to another.
In reality, “voting machines” that actually mark ballots are not typically directly connected to the internet, despite cries from election conspiracy theorists. The larger voting systems can be connected to the internet, often to use the election management software used to program machines and to test them, but this is supposed to occur before voting.
Polling locations in many states use WiFi to access electronic poll books to verify voter eligibility.
On Tuesday, there were isolated incidents of those electronic poll books – laptops used by election workers to ensure voters are registered – not working at polling sites in Detroit, Michigan, because of computer issues, but it did not prevent any voters from voting.
“Voting machines” that actually mark ballots are not typically directly connected to the internet. But the supporting pieces that make up the voting process can be – like election management software that is used to program voting machines beforehand.

Trump and other Republicans baselessly push disinformation after poll book mishap in Detroit
Trump urged followers to “protest,” and the GOP nominee for Michigan secretary of state falsely claimed “fraud” was to blame for what officials called a “harmless data error” in Detroit.
By the time Trump weighed in, the Michigan Department of State had already addressed what happened at select polling places in Detroit and said a resolution had been identified. That fix was sent to precincts by 11 a.m.
Even when the situation was still being reviewed, “voters were always able to vote,” Michigan Department of State spokesperson Jake Rollow told reporters Tuesday. “At no point was any, was there any inability to process a voter who showed up,” he said.
Rollow said there were a “couple reports” of isolated issues with e-poll books at some precincts in Detroit. E-poll books are laptops that have a static download of the voter registration list, Rollow said. When voters arrive at their polling place, election workers check them in on an e-poll book to ensure they’re registered, in the right precinct, and haven’t already voted absentee. Polling sites have hard copy paper backups to check in voters, Rollow said.
The City of Detroit Department of Elections explained in a statement that some e-poll books showed an incorrect message that read, “Ballot # has already been issued as Absentee Voter Ballot,” due to a “harmless data error,” but that didn’t mean anyone was attempting to vote twice.
Regardless, Kristina Karamo, the GOP nominee for Michigan secretary of state, falsely tweeted that there was “fraud” and a “crime” taking place.
And Trump falsely said on his Truth Social account, “the Absentee Ballot situation in Detroit is REALLY BAD. People are showing up to Vote only to be told, ‘sorry, you have already voted.’ This is happening in large numbers, elsewhere as well. Protest, Protest, Protest!”
Rollow explained that sometimes the same numbers are used for in-person and absentee ballots because they’re separate sets of ballots, and the technology is supposed to ignore it.
If poll workers encountered the issue, they were instructed to mark a ballot with an ‘X’ to make clear that the ballot was issued in person, he said.
Some voters who were affected earlier in the morning were given a provisional ballot, Rollow said. Those provisional ballots will be counted as if they were standard ballots and the voters do not have to take any additional action, he said.
“The protections were already and always in place to protect anyone from voting twice,” Rollow said later in the afternoon, adding that it “could not have occurred in this situation.”

Wisconsin election official shuts down fraud claims that poll worker illegally filled out ballots
A Wisconsin election official shot down claims made on social media suggesting a poll worker shown in a news clip was inappropriately filling out ballots.
The man appeared in footage of a polling center aired on a Fox News show, sitting at a table with a stack of ballots in front of him, looking from side to side as he flipped through the pages and made marks on the documents with his pen.
People on social media called out the man’s actions, questioning whether he was doing something illegal.
But the county clerk in Dane County, Wisconsin, told CNN that he looked into the incident and determined that the man pictured in the video was a poll worker who was initialing and indicating the ward number on the back of the ballots, in preparation for the ballots to be handed out to voters.
“This process is required by law and is part of the check and balance process,” Dane County Clerk Scott McDonell said in an email.
Some posts on social media about the video clip also erroneously suspected that the incident occurred at a Philadelphia election center, but a spokesperson for Philadelphia County confirmed to CNN that it did not take place at a polling location in the city.

 — 
As midterm results continue to roll in days after Election Day, Democratic and Republican candidates have already been celebrating historic victories.
Heading into Election Day, both parties were looking to diversify their ranks of elected officials, both in Congress and beyond, and they appear on track to do so.
House Republicans will add new members of color to their conference, including John James, who will be the first Black Republican congressman from Michigan, and Juan Ciscomani, who will be the first Latino Republican to represent Arizona in Congress.
Democrats will make a breakthrough for LGBTQ representation in governor’s offices. In Massachusetts and Oregon, Democrats Maura Healey and Tina Kotek will become the nation’s first out lesbian governors.
Republican Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the former Trump White House press secretary, will be the first female governor of Arkansas. And Maryland Democrat Wes Moore will be the state’s first Black governor.
There are still several races that have not yet been called. But for now, here’s a look at the candidates who CNN projects will make history in the 2022 midterms.
This list will be updated as more winners are projected.
Alabama

AL-SEN: Republican Katie Britt will be the first elected female senator from Alabama, CNN projects, winning an open-seat race to succeed her onetime boss, retiring GOP Sen. Richard Shelby. Britt is a former CEO of the Business Council of Alabama and was the heavy favorite in the general election in the deep-red state. Two women have previously represented Alabama in the Senate, but both were appointed to fill vacancies.
Arizona
AZ-06: Juan Ciscomani will be the first Latino Republican elected to Congress from Arizona, CNN projects, winning election to the state’s 6th Congressional District. Ciscomani, who was born in Mexico and immigrated to the US with his family as a child, previously worked at the Tucson Hispanic Chamber of Commerce and was a senior adviser to Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey.
Arkansas

AR-GOV: Republican Sarah Huckabee Sanders will be the first woman elected governor of Arkansas, CNN projects, winning the office her father previously held for over a decade. Sanders, who earned a national profile in her role as press secretary in the Trump White House, is also the first daughter in US history to serve as governor of the same state her father once led.
AR-LG: Republican Leslie Rutledge will be the first woman elected lieutenant governor of Arkansas, CNN projects. Rutledge, the state attorney general, originally sought the open governor’s seat but switched to the lieutenant governor’s race after Sanders entered the GOP gubernatorial primary. Lieutenant governors are elected on separate tickets in Arkansas.
With the election of Sanders and Rutledge, Arkansas will join Massachusetts as the first states to have women serving concurrently as governor and lieutenant governor.
California
CA-SEN: Democrat Alex Padilla will be the first elected Latino senator from California, CNN projects, winning a special election for the remainder of Kamala Harris’ term as well as an election for a full six-year term. Padilla, the son of Mexican immigrant parents, was appointed by California Gov. Gavin Newsom to the seat Harris vacated when she became vice president.
CA-SOS: Democrat Shirley Weber will be California’s first elected Black secretary of state of state, CNN projects. Weber, a former state assemblywoman, has been serving in the position since last year after Newsom picked her to succeed Padilla, who was appointed to the US Senate.
CA-AG: Democrat Rob Bonta will be California’s first elected Filipino American attorney general, CNN projects. Bonta, who was born in the Philippines and immigrated with his family to the US as an infant, has been serving in the position since last year after Newsom appointed him to succeed Xavier Becerra, who left to become President Joe Biden’s Health and Human Services secretary.
CA-42: Democrat Robert Garcia will be the first out LGBTQ immigrant elected to Congress, CNN projects, winning election to California’s 42nd Congressional District. Garcia, who immigrated from Lima, Peru, in the early 1980s at the age of 5, is the current mayor of Long Beach.
Los Angeles Mayor: Democrat Karen Bass will be the first woman and the first Black woman elected mayor of Los Angeles, CNN projects. Bass, who currently represents a Los Angeles-area House seat, will defeat real estate developer Rick Caruso. Bass was on Joe Biden’s short list for a running mate in the 2020 campaign. She’s no stranger to making history: She previously served in the California State Assembly, where in 2008 she became the first Black woman to serve as speaker of a state legislature.
Bass said on November 17, the day after her race was called, that the accomplishment of becoming the first female mayor of Los Angeles and the magnitude of the job was “sinking in.”
“To me, when you do make history, when you’re in a position like this – and I was in a similar position when I was sworn in as speaker – it means that you have extra responsibility. You always have to make sure that you maintain excellence in every step of the way,” she said. “The path that you go is laying the foundation for those that come behind you.”
Colorado
CO-08: Democrat Yadira Caraveo will be the first Latina elected to Congress from Colorado, CNN projects, winning the race for the state’s new 8th Congressional District. Caraveo, a state representative and the daughter of Mexican immigrant parents, will defeat Republican state Sen. Barbara Kirkmeyer to win the seat located north of Denver.
Connecticut
CT-SOS: Democrat Stephanie Thomas will be the first Black woman elected secretary of state of Connecticut, CNN projects. Thomas, a member of the Connecticut House, will succeed appointed Democratic incumbent Mark Kohler.
Florida

FL-10: Democrat Maxwell Frost will be the first member of Generation Z elected to Congress, CNN projects, winning the open seat for Florida’s 10th Congressional District. Generation Z refers to those born after 1996. Frost will succeed Democrat Val Demings, who vacated the seat to run for Senate.
The 25-year-old representative-elect told CNN’s Poppy Harlow on November 9 that when President Joe Biden called to congratulate him, the President recalled being too young to be sworn in as a senator when he was first elected at age 29.
“He asked me if it was the same situation. I said, ‘No, Mr. President, you had me beat on that. I’m already old enough to be sworn in on January 3.’ So, it was great to talk with him. You know, he was elected at a very young age, too, so he understands that experience,” Frost said on “CNN This Morning.”
Frost, who made reducing gun violence a central part of his campaign, also told CNN that he will work to pass universal background checks in Washington.
Illinois
IL-03: Democrat Delia Ramirez will be the first Latina elected to Congress from Illinois, CNN projects, winning election to the state’s redrawn 3rd Congressional District. Ramirez, a Chicago-area state representative and the daughter of Guatemalan immigrants, was also the first Guatemalan American to serve in the Illinois General Assembly.
IL-17: Democrat Eric Sorensen will be the first out gay person elected to Congress from Illinois, CNN projects, winning election to the state’s 17th Congressional District. Sorensen, a former Rockford and Quad Cities meteorologist, will defeat Republican Esther Joy King in the race to succeed retiring Democratic Rep. Cheri Bustos.
Maryland

MD-LG: Democrat Aruna Miller will be the first Asian American lieutenant governor of Maryland, CNN projects. Miller, who immigrated to the US with her family from India as a child, is a former member of the state House of Delegates. She was elected on the same ticket as Moore.
MD-AG: Anthony Brown will be the first Black person elected attorney general of Maryland, CNN projects. Brown, who currently represents Maryland’s 5th Congressional District, has a been a longtime fixture in state politics, having also served as state lieutenant governor and in the state House and run for governor in 2014.
Massachusetts

MA-GOV: Democrat Maura Healey will be one of the first out lesbian governors in US history, CNN projects, winning an open-seat race for the governorship of Massachusetts. Healey, the current attorney general of Massachusetts, will also be the commonwealth’s first elected female governor. Also making history with Healey as one of the nation’s first out lesbian governors is Oregon Democrat Tina Kotek.
With the election of Healey and her running mate, Kim Driscoll, Massachusetts will join Arkansas as the first states to have women serving concurrently as governor and lieutenant governor.
MA-AG: Democrat Andrea Campbell will be the first Black woman elected attorney general of Massachusetts, CNN projects. Campbell, who ran for Boston mayor last year, was previously the first Black female president of the Boston City Council.
Michigan
MI-10: John James will be the first Black Republican elected to Congress from Michigan, CNN projects, winning election to the state’s 10th Congressional District. James, who lost bids for US Senate in 2018 and 2020, will defeat Democrat Carl Marlinga in the open-seat race for the redrawn suburban Detroit district.
MI-13: Democrat Shri Thanedar will be the first Indian American elected to Congress from Michigan, CNN projects, winning election to the state’s 13th Congressional District.

NY-03: Republican George Santos will be the next congressman from New York’s 3rd Congressional District, CNN projects, winning the first House election between two out gay candidates. Santos, an investor and the son of Brazilian immigrants, will defeat Democrat Robert Zimmerman for the Long Island-based seat.

OH-09: Democrat Marcy Kaptur will win a 21st term to the House from Ohio, CNN projects, and will become the longest-serving woman in Congress when she’s sworn in next year to represent the state’s 9th Congressional District.

It was 150 years ago this year that noted suffragette and voting rights activist Susan B. Anthony illegally cast her vote in her hometown of Rochester, New York. She was arrested, and then convicted for voting illegally. Nearly 50 years later, after the 19th amendment passed on June 4, 1919, White women like Anthony were legally granted the right to vote.
On Tuesday, women and men paid tribute to Anthony's trailblazing efforts by visiting her final resting place and leaving their “I Voted Today” stickers on her gravestone after voting in the 2022 midterm elections. It's been a local Rochester tradition for years now to visit the site at Mount Hope Cemetery, also the resting place of abolitionist Fredrick Douglass, on Election Day.
New York State Senator Samra Brouk, and Assemblymembers Sarah Clark and Jennifer Lunsford held a rally this year where supporters marched from Anthony's home to the nearest polling station in an effort to encourage women to vote in this year's midterm election.
""With all that’s going on with rights for women right now, and our ability to make decisions on our own bodies and healthcare eroding, it's important for us to show up and vote,"" Clark said.
""This year women in particular are seeing what happens if we are getting lackadaisical about our rights,” Lunsford said. “We are at risk of losing what we take for granted. Following the reversal of Roe v Wade, this has become more evident than ever.""
Clark has been leaving her “I Voted Today” sticker at Anthony’s gravestone since 2016 when, like many others, she braved the long line to get a chance to place her sticker on the women’s right’s advocate’s gravestone in honor of Hilary Clinton.
On Tuesday, six years on, Clark visited the gravesite to place that sticker on Anthony's tombstone once again, as is Rochester tradition.
The headstone looks a little different than it did in 2016. For one, it's under a plastic cover protecting the grave marker being damaged from the myriad of stickers that often get placed on it every election cycle. There's also no throng of people waiting in line at the gravesite like in 2016.
Clark said 120 people marched and voted to commemorate the 150th anniversary of Susan B. Anthony’s historic vote. The assemblywoman said they handed out “I Voted When She Voted” stickers to all march-goers who voted. The hashtag #SusanBAnthony on social media shows women posting photos of their ""I Voted Today"" sticker on Anthony’s headstone.

Biden appears to avoid the midterm Democratic purge many in his party feared
From CNN's MJ Lee

As many in the country were going to bed last night, President Biden and his advisers – up late into the night watching the midterm returns come in — felt convinced of two things: Races across the board looked competitive, and Democrats appeared to have avoided a bloodbath that some had predicted and feared.
The White House wakes up this morning to real reasons for that optimism from the previous night to continue: The possibility of Democrats’ keeping the Senate in their hands very much remains intact, and they’ve seen Democratic governors of big swing states and key House frontliners in their party win their races.
A huge outstanding question, of course, remains the fate of the House – and just how many seats Republicans will ultimately end up picking up. 
Whether Democrats can keep control of the Senate – and how the makeup of the House will ultimately shake out – will have huge implications for President Biden and his party’s ability to govern in the second half of his first term.
And as the White House is poised to highlight some of the bright spots from last night’s results, a challenge for them will be whether they can successfully make the case that some of these Democrats were able to hold their own because of the White House and President Biden – not in spite of them.
Leading up to Election Day, there was already starting to be plenty of finger-pointing at the White House. Some House Democrats, for example, told CNN that Biden and his team failed to drive hard at an economic message, at a moment when voters have made clear that it is overwhelmingly their most important issue.
One progressive House member put it bluntly to CNN: “We knew the economy would be bad… and they didn’t have an economic message at all.”
The lawmaker lamented – echoing sentiments expressed by some of their colleagues – that they also didn’t see the White House adequately take credit for Democrats’ legislative wins, including last year’s passage of a major bipartisan infrastructure bill. It was a “total failure to take a victory lap,” they said. 
But if many Democrats were ready to start playing the blame game, the results so far could have bought everyone some breathing room – the White House most of all —at least for a few days.
White House officials have insisted in the final stretch of the midterms that Biden has consistently discussed the economy and made economic issues key to his political messaging.
They’ve also made clear that they believe voters are considering a range of issues as they head to ballot boxes – and not just the economy – and that it was critical for the leader of the Democratic Party to publicly discuss issues like abortion rights, gun safety and protecting democracy, which they believe have played major roles in animating the Democratic base.
The thinking goes like this – it would have been unthinkable for Biden to have not addressed the state of women’s reproductive rights in this country after the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe; similarly, there was no scenario in which the president would have neglected to speak out publicly against election deniers and threats and acts and politically motivated violence, when it was plainly obvious to him just how serious these issues were this election cycle.
While the exact timing and plans remain in flux, Biden is expected to address the election results in some form on Wednesday.

Here's why the Georgia Senate race may be headed to a run-off 
From CNN's Gregory Krieg

The hotly contested Senate contest in Georgia is too early to call, with Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock and Republican challenger Herschel Walker locked in a tight race that could decide control of the US Senate.
Remember: If neither candidate surpasses the 50% threshold, Warnock and Walker will proceed to a Dec. 6 run-off. Depending on the outcome of Senate races in Pennsylvania, Arizona and Nevada, voters in Georgia could then – for the second consecutive election cycle – have the Senate majority in their hands.
That the race is so close underscores the prevalence of ticket-splitters in Georgia this year. Republican Gov. Brian Kemp comfortably defeated Democrat Stacey Abrams, CNN projected, but Walker has lagged Kemp’s margin all night, while Warnock has outpaced Abrams.
In brief remarks on Tuesday night, Walker asked supporters gathered in a hotel ballroom to “hang in there a little bit longer.”
“I’m telling you right now – I didn’t come to lose,” Walker said.
Warnock has not yet addressed the crowd at his election night headquarters. But on Monday night, he joked to CNN about a potential run-off campaign.
“I think that there is bipartisan agreement that we (would) rather not have politics and Thanksgiving mixed together,” Warnock said.

Some 2020 election deniers will win secretary of state races, CNN projects
From CNN's Daniel Dale 
Some Republican candidates who have denied or refused to affirm the results of the 2020 election will be elected as state elections chief, CNN projects — though others will be defeated.
Here are three Republican secretary of state winners CNN has projected so far: 
Alabama: State Rep. Wes Allen, who endorsed the Texas-led legal effort to get the Supreme Court to overturn Joe Biden’s victory.
Indiana: Diego Morales, a former Mike Pence aide who wrote an article during the 2022 primary in which he falsely called the 2020 election a “scam” and wrongly said “the outcome is questionable.”
South Dakota: Monae Johnson, who repeatedly refused in an October 2022 interview to say that she accepted that Biden won the 2020 election legitimately.
In addition, Republican candidate Chuck Gray of Wyoming ran unopposed for secretary of state in the general election after winning the Republican primary. 
Here are five election deniers CNN projects will lose their 2022 races:
Massachusetts: Rayla Campbell, who falsely claimed Donald Trump was the real winner of a “stolen” 2020 election.
Minnesota: Kim Crockett, who baselessly said Minnesota’s 2020 election was “lawless” and that she agreed with an interviewer who called it “illegitimate.”
New Mexico: Audrey Trujillo, who also falsely claimed the 2020 election was “stolen” from Trump. 
Vermont: H. Brooke Paige, another candidate who falsely claimed the left “stole” the election.
Michigan: Kristina Karamo, who also falsely claimed in a social media video in December 2020 “Donald Trump won Michigan.”
CNN found that at least 12 Republican candidates for secretary of state have questioned, rejected or tried to overturn the results of the 2020 election. CNN had not yet projected the other races as of midnight ET on Wednesday morning.

Here are key takeaways from the midterm elections so far — and where things stand in the balance of power

The battle for control of Congress – both the House and the Senate – is coming down to a dwindling number of key races, with Democrats dashing Republicans’ hopes for a red wave and both parties hanging onto hopes of winning narrow majorities.
Republicans began the night with a rout in Florida, where Gov. Ron DeSantis won heavily Latino, historically Democratic regions on his way to a blowout victory that could serve as a launch pad for a 2024 presidential run.
But in the hours that have followed, Democrats have fought back. In Pennsylvania, Democratic Lt. Gov. John Fetterman defeated Republican Mehmet Oz for the seat of retiring Republican Sen. Pat Toomey.
Meanwhile, the battle for the House majority – one that favored Republicans, who expected to benefit from high inflation, historical trends and friendly new district lines after 2021’s redistricting – remains unsettled.
Here are some key takeaways as votes continue to be counted in key races:
Democrats go a long way to protecting their Senate majority: Republicans were not shy about the importance of Pennsylvania’s Senate race: “This is a must-win race. We believe if we win Pennsylvania, we win the majority,” said Steven Law, president of the preeminent Republican Senate super PAC. Early on Wednesday morning, CNN projected that Fetterman would be the next senator from Pennsylvania, defeating Oz in the most expensive and high stakes Senate campaign in the country. Fetterman’s win was a thunderclap for Democrats.
Democrats and the suburbs: Suburban areas across the country went a long way to helping Democrats avoid a significant red wave. Republicans may still win the House, but if the 2022 election was going to be a red wave, it was likely to come through suburban victories that have not materialized yet. Republicans did score some suburban victories – CNN projected Brandon Ogles the winner in a district around Nashville, Tom Kean Jr. winning in a suburban New Jersey district and Rich McCormick the victor in a district that included Atlanta’s northern suburbs – but it was their defeats that spoke volumes about the size of the GOP wave.
Virginia’s split decision offers early signals: Three Democratic-controlled House races in Virginia were widely viewed as an early warning signal of the night’s results. Democrats held seats in two Virginia districts Biden won in 2020. CNN projected that Democratic Jennifer Wexton won her reelection bid in Virginia’s 10th District. In an even more competitive race, CNN projected Rep. Abigail Spanberger also won reelection in Virginia’s 7th District. But Democrats lost in southeastern Virginia, with CNN projecting that Republican state Sen. Jen Kiggans defeated Democratic Rep. Elaine Luria.
Another Jan. 6 committee member loses: Luria, a member of the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, lost her Virginia Beach-based House seat, CNN projected. She had defeated former GOP Rep. Scott Taylor in 2018 and 2020. But the district had become slightly more favorable ground for Republicans in redistricting: Biden carried the previous version by 5 points, and would have lost the new district by 2 points.

DeSantis and 2024: Gov. Ron DeSantis led a dominant Republican ticket in Florida – delivering historic margins in Democratic territory in his victory over Democratic Rep. Charlie Crist on a night that provides him a powerful argument if he seeks the GOP’s 2024 presidential nomination. The easy wins by DeSantis, who led by nearly 20 percentage points with 92% of the estimated vote counted, and Sen. Marco Rubio, who was 17 points up, were enough to cast doubt on Florida’s status as a national bellwether.
GOP makes gains with Latinos in Florida: Republicans hoped to build on Trump’s inroads among Latino voters in 2020, a trend that could reshape the political landscapes in several swing states if it continues. The strongest early signal that the GOP had continued to make gains came in Miami-Dade County, home to a large Cuban population. But it’ll take a while to fully gauge whether those GOP gains take place outside of Florida.
Win for abortion rights: In Michigan, Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer – who staked her reelection campaign on her successful efforts to block the enforcement of the state’s 1931 law banning abortion in almost all instances – defeated Republican challenger Tudor Dixon, who had waged a campaign focused on cultural battles. Michigan voters also approved a Whitmer-backed amendment to the state’s constitution that will scrap that 1931 law and guarantee abortion rights. Voters in California and Vermont also green-lit constitutional amendments enshrining abortion rights.

Marijuana legalization on the ballot in these states: Here’s what voters decided

 — 
Ballot measures to legalize recreational marijuana use will fail in three states and pass in two, CNN projects, as momentum has grown nationwide to push for lifting penalties once associated with cannabis.
Here’s what voters decided in Arkansas, Maryland, Missouri, North Dakota and South Dakota on Tuesday:
Arkansas
Arkansas voters on Tuesday will reject a constitutional amendment that would have allowed cannabis possession and recreational consumption by adults as well as the sale by licensed facilities, CNN projects. Had it passed, cannabis possession of up to an ounce would have been legal and some tax revenue from marijuana sales would have contributed to funding law enforcement.
Maryland
Maryland voters on Tuesday will approve a constitutional amendment that legalizes recreational marijuana for people 21 and older. It will go into effect on July 1, 2023, and allow possession of 1.5 ounces or two plants. Possession of small amounts of marijuana was already decriminalized in Maryland. Under the amendment, those previously convicted of cannabis possession and intent to distribute will be able to apply for record expungement.
Missouri
Missouri voters will approve a proposed measure to end prohibitions on marijuana in the state and allow personal use for those over the age of 21, CNN projects.
It will allow for personal possession up to three ounces and allow individuals with marijuana-related non-violent offenses to petition for release from prison or parole and probation and have their records expunged.
North Dakota
A citizen-initiated ballot measure that aimed at allowing the use of marijuana in “various forms” for those who are at least 21 years-old will be rejected by North Dakota voters, CNN projects. It would have allowed marijuana possession of up to an ounce and all marijuana to be tested in a facility “for the potency of products and the presence of pesticides” and subject to random inspection.
South Dakota
South Dakotans will vote down a measure to legalize cannabis in the state, CNN projects. Legalization for recreational marijuana use had passed in South Dakota in 2020, but the results were nullified by state courts.
According to the proposed 2022 ballot measure, marijuana possession of up to an ounce would have been legal. It also would have legalized possession of marijuana paraphernalia, use and distribution.

2022 midterm election results
By Adrienne Vogt, Aditi Sangal, Mike Hayes, Elise Hammond, Maureen Chowdhury, Tara Subramaniam, Melissa Macaya and Meg Wagner, CNN
Updated 11:29 PM ET, Fri November 11, 2022
What we're covering here
Control of the Senate and House still in the balance: All eyes are on undecided Arizona and Nevada Senate races, as Georgia's contest heads to a Dec. 6 runoff. At least 400,000 votes remain to be counted in Arizona's Maricopa County alone, officials said.
Democrats flip key Senate seat: Democrat John Fetterman flipped Pennsylvania's Senate seat, CNN projected, boosting Democratic hopes of keeping their majority. Both parties now need two seats to win control of the Senate.
Biden addresses the country: President Biden called the midterms a ""good day for America,"" noting that the ""giant red wave"" that was predicted didn't happen and that it's still possible that Democrats hold the House.
Historic firsts: Both parties are diversifying their ranks. Here's a look at the candidates CNN projects will make history.

As US heads towards a potentially divided government, Biden aims to assert American leadership abroad
From CNN's Kevin Liptak
(Susan Walsh/AP)
It’s a story President Joe Biden tells at nearly every opportunity: last year, meeting his new counterparts at his first international summit, he proudly informed them, “America is back.”
“For how long?” one of them asked.
As Biden departs this week for a weeklong around-the-world trip, the question still resonates.
“If the United States tomorrow were to, quote, withdraw from the world, a lot of things would change around the world. A whole lot would change,” Biden said ahead of his trip.
Biden hopes his stops at a climate meeting here on the Red Sea, a gathering of Southeast Asian nations in Cambodia and a high-stakes Group of 20 summit on the Indonesian island of Bali will assert American leadership in areas former President Donald Trump either ignored or actively shunned.
Four defining global threats will loom over Biden’s trip: Russia’s war in Ukraine, escalating tensions with China, the existential problem of climate change and the potential for a global recession in the coming months. Other flashpoints, like North Korea’s rapidly accelerating provocations and uncertainty over Iran’s nuclear program, will also factor in. 
Of those, defending Ukraine and combating climate change could be the most impacted by results from this week’s election. 
At moments of domestic political turmoil, US presidents have often turned to foreign policy, where they can act with relatively few congressional restraints. President Barack Obama launched a similar tour of Asia after his self-described “shellacking” in the 2010 midterms. 
Biden and his advisers believe they are entering the series of high-stakes meetings with a solid argument that his version of the US role in the world will endure. He resisted historical and political headwinds in this year’s midterm elections while many of Trump’s handpicked candidates lost. And over the past year, he secured passage of a major climate investment and rallied the world behind efforts to support Ukraine and isolate Russia.
Yet the anxieties of American allies persist over the future of US commitments – to Ukraine, to fighting climate change, to treaty partners and, perhaps most urgently, to upholding Democratic norms. Foreign diplomats have watched intently as the midterm political season played out, searching for clues to how the American electorate was judging Biden's first two years in office and reporting back to their capitals on voter dissatisfaction that could fuel Trump's return to office.
As of Wednesday night, Republicans appeared to be moving toward gaining control of the House of Representatives. And Trump is readying a third presidential bid, potentially to be announced while Biden is on the opposite side of the planet.

Senate control could hinge on two states with prominent election deniers 
From CNN's Maeve Reston

Control of the US Senate could hinge on Nevada and Arizona, two states where GOP victories could elevate some of the most prominent election deniers in the country even after other nominees who had amplified former President Donald Trump’s falsehoods about the 2020 election were rejected by voters in Tuesday’s midterm elections.
Those two western states – perpetual battlegrounds in presidential years – were still too early to call as of early Thursday morning, while a third Democratic-held seat, Georgia, will advance to a December runoff, CNN projects. Republicans need to pick off two Democratic seats to win the majority. As ballots continue to be counted across the country, Republicans appear to be slowly inching toward the 218 seats that would deliver them a House majority, albeit one that’s much narrower than they’d hoped.
The struggle for the Senate, however, is still full of unknowns – including whether it will all come down once again to Georgia after the Peach State delivered Democrats the majority in 2021 with victories in twin runoffs. It’s Nevada and Arizona that will determine how pivotal Georgia becomes.
Arizona Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly was maintaining an edge over Republican Blake Masters as of early Thursday morning, while Nevada Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto was trailing Republican Adam Laxalt. CNN had estimated late Wednesday that about 600,000 votes remained to be counted across the Grand Canyon State and about 160,000 votes remained to be counted in Nevada.
Nevada: Laxalt, the state's former attorney general, was a co-chairman of Trump’s 2020 presidential campaign in the state and filed lawsuits attempting to overturn Nevada’s results in that election, which he said was “rigged.” Cortez Masto had argued that the lies and election conspiracy theories embraced by Trump and allies like Laxalt led to the attack on the US Capitol on January 6, 2021.
Arizona: Masters, a venture capitalist and first-time candidate, released a campaign video as he was competing for the GOP nomination in which he said he believed Trump had won the 2020 election. Masters, like Laxalt, clinched Trump’s endorsement.
After winning the Arizona Senate primary, Masters briefly appeared to back away from some of that extreme rhetoric – scrubbing his website, for example, of language that included the false claim that the election was stolen. In a debate with Kelly, he also conceded that he had not seen evidence of fraud that would have changed the outcome of the election. But the Republican nominee seemed to reverse course after receiving a phone call from Trump urging him to “go stronger” on election denialism, a conversation that was captured in a Fox documentary.

Analysis: A midterm stalemate will unleash turmoil and acrimony in run up to 2024
From CNN's Stephen Collinson
US democracy, which almost buckled two years ago, just delivered a perfect reflection of a polarized nation that mistrusts its leaders and isn’t ready to unite on a new path.
Tuesday’s midterm elections gave Americans two more years to collectively decide what they really want by likely ushering in a divided government that is certain to be acrimonious but will prevent Democrats or Republicans from engineering a major ideological shift. It also scrambled the terrain of the early 2024 presidential race, with President Joe Biden and ex-President Donald Trump both moving toward new campaigns that much of the country appears not to want.
A divided government would mean two years of dysfunction, bitterness, fiscal cliffs and debt showdowns between a Republican House and the Democratic White House. Token talk of bipartisan cooperation won’t last long. Even if Democrats somehow manage to cling to the House as final results trickle in, they’d also lack the leeway to pass nation-changing laws. And whoever wins the Senate majority, the chamber will effectively be split down the middle and locked in an angry stalemate. Like America itself.
What this means for 2024: The election results pose new questions heading into the next White House campaign over the prospects of both Trump and Biden. Trump’s obsession with promoting chaos candidates in his image may yet again doom Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell’s chances of returning as majority leader. Trump, of course, is already blaming everyone but himself as he eyes a campaign launch next week that will lack the springboard of a Republican landslide he would have claimed was all his doing. And the roaring reelection of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis presented Trump with a huge potential 2024 GOP primary headache.
Biden, meanwhile, seemed unusually upbeat for a president who may soon face a tsunami of subpoenas, investigations and even possible impeachment from a GOP House. He enjoyed calling out the conventional wisdom during a White House news conference on Wednesday afternoon. “While the press and the pundits were predicting a giant red wave, it didn’t happen,” he said.
When Biden meets world leaders in the coming days in Egypt and Bali, Indonesia, he can crow about escaping the epic first-term shellacking suffered by most presidents. He also put off an immediate inquest about his suitability to carry the Democratic banner into 2024, ahead of a vacation he said he’d like to take between Thanksgiving and Christmas with First Lady Jill Biden to consider his future.
Yet a loss is a loss. And CNN exit polls show only 30% of House race voters want a president with a low-40s approval rating, who will be 80 in a few weeks, to run for reelection in a campaign that could well coincide with the recession many economists fear. Biden would prefer another finding from those same polls, however, that showed Trump – with a 39% approval rating – is even less popular.

Here's where things stand with the balance of power in the Senate and the House
From CNN's Ethan Cohen
With the day after the election wrapping up, control of Congress remains undetermined.
Republicans hold 49 seats in the Senate, while the Democrats have 48. Two states are uncalled and Georgia's Senate seat will be decided by a December runoff election.
In the House, it could be days until a full picture emerges as votes are still being counted in states like California, Oregon, Nevada and Arizona. 
Senate
It's still too early to call which party will gain control of the Senate.
Democrats have had the only pickup so far with John Fetterman’s win in Pennsylvania, but they still need to win two more seats to guarantee control. 
On Wednesday, CNN projected that GOP Sen. Ron Johnson would hold his seat in Wisconsin and that Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock and Republican Herschel Walker will be headed to a Dec. 6 runoff in Georgia. 
CNN hasn’t made a projection of party control in two other seats – Arizona and Nevada. 
As of 11:30 p.m. ET, Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona was ahead of Republican Blake Masters by about 95,000 votes after a vote report from Maricopa County expanded Kelly’s lead. CNN estimates that as of 11:30 p.m. Wednesday, about 600,000 votes remain to be counted in Arizona.
In Nevada, Republican Adam Laxalt currently leads the count against Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto. CNN estimates that as of 11:30 p.m. Wednesday, about 160,000 votes remain to be counted in Nevada.
Nightly vote reports from the largest counties are expected in both states.
While CNN has projected that Alaska’s Senate seat will be controlled by Republicans, CNN has not projected whether Sen. Lisa Murkowski or Kelly Tshibaka will prevail. If neither gets over 50% of first-choice votes, the contest will be decided by ranked-choice voting. 
 Click here for the most up-to-date numbers. 
House
There are currently 35 uncalled House races – Democrats lead in the vote count in 24 of them as of 11:30 p.m. while Republicans lead in 11. 
Republicans need to win 9 more seats to reach the 218 needed to control the House, Democrats need to win 27 more seats to reach 218.

Analysis: Why the news media got the midterm ""red wave"" narrative so wrong
From CNN's Oliver Darcy
The White House believes that the press has “egg on their faces, yet again.”
That’s according to a White House official who spoke candidly with CNN on Wednesday about the media’s “red wave” narrative that wasn’t.
Heading into Tuesday, the dominant narrative in the press — especially right-wing media — was that Republicans were on track to have a big, if not monster, night. Focusing largely on the fragile state of the economy, coupled with the fact that the incumbent party historically doesn’t perform well in such elections, the press had all but declared that Democrats would get trounced from coast-to-coast.
But as election results came in Tuesday night, the great wave turned into a mere ripple. Pundits such as Ben Shapiro noted the view had gone “from red wave to red wedding.” Even on Fox News, the right-wing cable network that had heavily hyped the red wave presumption to its audience, pundits acknowledged the reality. Marc Thiessen, a former speechwriter for President George W. Bush, called it an “absolute disaster” for the GOP.
So what happened?

Female governors will break a record in 2023

The US will have a record number of female governors in 2023. Still, the record-setting number – 12 – will represent a small fraction of the top executives across the 50 states.
The previous record of nine female governors serving concurrently was set in 2004, according to the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University.
Incumbent female governors in Maine, Alabama, Michigan, Iowa, South Dakota, Kansas and New Mexico won reelection on Tuesday, while New York Gov. Kathy Hochul won a first full term after taking over the top job in 2021 following the resignation of Andrew Cuomo. Hochul will become the first elected female governor in the state.
Two states – Massachusetts and Arkansas – elected new female governors. Democrat Maura Healey will become the first woman elected to the governorship of Massachusetts and the first out lesbian governor in the US. Republican Sarah Huckabee Sanders, a former White House press secretary in the Trump administration, will become the state’s first female governor, winning the job that her father once held.
Arkansas and Massachusetts will also become the first states to have women serving in the governor and lieutenant governor positions at the same time, according to CAWP.

Voters deliver ringing endorsement of abortion rights via midterm ballot initiatives

Voters in key states on Tuesday made their support for abortion rights clear, affirming a months-long push by Democrats to act on a number of ballot measures in the wake of the Supreme Court’s decision overturning Roe v. Wade.
Several states moved to enshrine abortion protections in their constitutions and others rejected proposals to limit abortion access or criminalize doctors in some cases. Democratic lawmakers and organizers cast the midterm elections as a referendum on Republican efforts to limit women’s choices, and the notable electoral reaction could serve as a warning sign for future GOP efforts to restrict the procedure at the state level.
About 27% of voters cited abortion as the issue most important to them, according to the preliminary results of the national and state exit polls conducted for CNN and other news networks by Edison Research. The results also showed that when it comes to the issue, roughly half of voters said they trusted Democratic candidates, compared with more than four in 10 voters who said they trusted Republican candidates.
“This fall, Roe is on the ballot,” President Joe Biden declared in a defiant speech from the White House just hours after the Supreme Court’s ruling earlier this year.
While CNN projected some anti-abortion Republicans will win their races, voters in five states moved to affirm abortion rights.

Results are still coming in from the midterm elections, and while many key races have yet to be called, both parties are already celebrating historic victories. Voters across the country elected several breakthrough candidates that will diversify the nation’s political ranks with women, people of color, members of the LGBTQ community, and Generation Z.
Here’s what else you need to know to Get Up to Speed and On with Your Day.
(You can get “5 Things You Need to Know Today” delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.)
1. Midterms
The fight for control of Congress – both the House of Representatives and the Senate – still hangs in the balance as results continue to trickle in from crucial midterm contests. It’s too early to call key races – including in Nevada, Georgia, Wisconsin and Arizona – that could determine which party controls the chambers. But in closely-watched Pennsylvania, Democrat John Fetterman will win the state’s Senate seat, CNN projects, and defeat Trump-backed Republican Mehmet Oz. The pickup is a big boost to Democrats’ hopes of clinging to the Senate. Meanwhile, the battle for the House majority, one that favored Republicans, remains unsettled as the red wave that Republicans hoped for has yet to materialize. 
2. Abortion
Voters in three states moved to protect abortion rights on Tuesday after a monthslong push from Democrats nationwide to act on the issue in the wake of the Supreme Court’s decision overturning Roe v. Wade. While CNN has projected some anti-abortion Republicans will win their races, voters in Michigan, California and Vermont passed initiatives that will protect the right to the procedure. Some measures are still too early to call, including an amendment to Kentucky’s constitution to say that it does not “secure or protect a right” to abortion or the funding of abortion. Meanwhile, voters in Montana considered a ballot referendum that would impose criminal penalties on health care providers who do not act to preserve the life of infants born during the course of an abortion.
3. Inflation
High prices for food, gas and other essentials were at the top of mind for voters as they cast ballots in this year’s midterms, according to preliminary results of national and state exit polls. Around three-quarters of voters nationally said the economy is “poor” or “not good,” and the same share said that inflation – which has hovered around 40-year highs – has caused them severe or moderate hardship. The exit poll results, conducted for CNN and other news networks by Edison Research, are in line with pre-election polling, as well as consumer confidence surveys, all of which show that Americans are worried about the state of the economy. Roughly half of voters also said they approve President Joe Biden’s student loan forgiveness effort, while nearly the same disapprove.

4. Tropical Storm Nicole
Tropical Storm Nicole is expected to slam into Florida’s east coast as a possible Category 1 hurricane in less than 24 hours, prompting evacuations in areas still recovering from Hurricane Ian. Nearly four million people along Florida’s east coast are under hurricane warnings as Nicole is poised to make landfall late Wednesday north of West Palm Beach. The National Hurricane Center predicts the coastal area will receive up to 8 inches of rain and storm surge that could rise to 5 feet. Separately, the storm is barreling toward the launch site of NASA’s Artemis I mission. As a result, the launch – which aims to send an uncrewed spacecraft on a test mission around the moon – has been delayed yet again.
5. Meta
Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced major layoffs at the tech giant will begin this morning. The upcoming job cuts will impact 11,000 employees and mark the first broad headcount reductions in the company’s history, Zuckerberg wrote in a blog post to employees today. Meta, Facebook’s parent company, had more than 87,000 employees as of September, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, after it staffed up during the pandemic while business boomed. The reports of significant layoffs at Meta come just days after Twitter, Lyft and Amazon announced sweeping job cuts or pauses on hiring.

As midterm results continue to roll in days after Election Day, Democratic and Republican candidates have already been celebrating historic victories.
Heading into Election Day, both parties were looking to diversify their ranks of elected officials, both in Congress and beyond, and they appear on track to do so.
House Republicans will add new members of color to their conference, including John James, who will be the first Black Republican congressman from Michigan, and Juan Ciscomani, who will be the first Latino Republican to represent Arizona in Congress.
Democrats will make a breakthrough for LGBTQ representation in governor’s offices. In Massachusetts and Oregon, Democrats Maura Healey and Tina Kotek will become the nation’s first out lesbian governors.
Republican Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the former Trump White House press secretary, will be the first female governor of Arkansas. And Maryland Democrat Wes Moore will be the state’s first Black governor.
There are still several races that have not yet been called. But for now, here’s a look at the candidates who CNN projects will make history in the 2022 midterms.
This list will be updated as more winners are projected.
Alabama

Butch Dill/AP
AL-SEN: Republican Katie Britt will be the first elected female senator from Alabama, CNN projects, winning an open-seat race to succeed her onetime boss, retiring GOP Sen. Richard Shelby. Britt is a former CEO of the Business Council of Alabama and was the heavy favorite in the general election in the deep-red state. Two women have previously represented Alabama in the Senate, but both were appointed to fill vacancies.
Arizona
AZ-06: Juan Ciscomani will be the first Latino Republican elected to Congress from Arizona, CNN projects, winning election to the state’s 6th Congressional District. Ciscomani, who was born in Mexico and immigrated to the US with his family as a child, previously worked at the Tucson Hispanic Chamber of Commerce and was a senior adviser to Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey.
Arkansas

AR-GOV: Republican Sarah Huckabee Sanders will be the first woman elected governor of Arkansas, CNN projects, winning the office her father previously held for over a decade. Sanders, who earned a national profile in her role as press secretary in the Trump White House, is also the first daughter in US history to serve as governor of the same state her father once led.
AR-LG: Republican Leslie Rutledge will be the first woman elected lieutenant governor of Arkansas, CNN projects. Rutledge, the state attorney general, originally sought the open governor’s seat but switched to the lieutenant governor’s race after Sanders entered the GOP gubernatorial primary. Lieutenant governors are elected on separate tickets in Arkansas.
With the election of Sanders and Rutledge, Arkansas will join Massachusetts as the first states to have women serving concurrently as governor and lieutenant governor.
California
CA-SEN: Democrat Alex Padilla will be the first elected Latino senator from California, CNN projects, winning a special election for the remainder of Kamala Harris’ term as well as an election for a full six-year term. Padilla, the son of Mexican immigrant parents, was appointed by California Gov. Gavin Newsom to the seat Harris vacated when she became vice president.
CA-SOS: Democrat Shirley Weber will be California’s first elected Black secretary of state of state, CNN projects. Weber, a former state assemblywoman, has been serving in the position since last year after Newsom picked her to succeed Padilla, who was appointed to the US Senate.
CA-AG: Democrat Rob Bonta will be California’s first elected Filipino American attorney general, CNN projects. Bonta, who was born in the Philippines and immigrated with his family to the US as an infant, has been serving in the position since last year after Newsom appointed him to succeed Xavier Becerra, who left to become President Joe Biden’s Health and Human Services secretary.
CA-42: Democrat Robert Garcia will be the first out LGBTQ immigrant elected to Congress, CNN projects, winning election to California’s 42nd Congressional District. Garcia, who immigrated from Lima, Peru, in the early 1980s at the age of 5, is the current mayor of Long Beach.
Los Angeles Mayor: Democrat Karen Bass will be the first woman and the first Black woman elected mayor of Los Angeles, CNN projects. Bass, who currently represents a Los Angeles-area House seat, will defeat real estate developer Rick Caruso. Bass was on Joe Biden’s short list for a running mate in the 2020 campaign. She’s no stranger to making history: She previously served in the California State Assembly, where in 2008 she became the first Black woman to serve as speaker of a state legislature.
Bass said on November 17, the day after her race was called, that the accomplishment of becoming the first female mayor of Los Angeles and the magnitude of the job was “sinking in.”
“To me, when you do make history, when you’re in a position like this – and I was in a similar position when I was sworn in as speaker – it means that you have extra responsibility. You always have to make sure that you maintain excellence in every step of the way,” she said. “The path that you go is laying the foundation for those that come behind you.”
Colorado
CO-08: Democrat Yadira Caraveo will be the first Latina elected to Congress from Colorado, CNN projects, winning the race for the state’s new 8th Congressional District. Caraveo, a state representative and the daughter of Mexican immigrant parents, will defeat Republican state Sen. Barbara Kirkmeyer to win the seat located north of Denver.
Connecticut
CT-SOS: Democrat Stephanie Thomas will be the first Black woman elected secretary of state of Connecticut, CNN projects. Thomas, a member of the Connecticut House, will succeed appointed Democratic incumbent Mark Kohler.
Florida

FL-10: Democrat Maxwell Frost will be the first member of Generation Z elected to Congress, CNN projects, winning the open seat for Florida’s 10th Congressional District. Generation Z refers to those born after 1996. Frost will succeed Democrat Val Demings, who vacated the seat to run for Senate.
The 25-year-old representative-elect told CNN’s Poppy Harlow on November 9 that when President Joe Biden called to congratulate him, the President recalled being too young to be sworn in as a senator when he was first elected at age 29.
“He asked me if it was the same situation. I said, ‘No, Mr. President, you had me beat on that. I’m already old enough to be sworn in on January 3.’ So, it was great to talk with him. You know, he was elected at a very young age, too, so he understands that experience,” Frost said on “CNN This Morning.”
Frost, who made reducing gun violence a central part of his campaign, also told CNN that he will work to pass universal background checks in Washington.
Illinois
IL-03: Democrat Delia Ramirez will be the first Latina elected to Congress from Illinois, CNN projects, winning election to the state’s redrawn 3rd Congressional District. Ramirez, a Chicago-area state representative and the daughter of Guatemalan immigrants, was also the first Guatemalan American to serve in the Illinois General Assembly.
IL-17: Democrat Eric Sorensen will be the first out gay person elected to Congress from Illinois, CNN projects, winning election to the state’s 17th Congressional District. Sorensen, a former Rockford and Quad Cities meteorologist, will defeat Republican Esther Joy King in the race to succeed retiring Democratic Rep. Cheri Bustos.
Maryland

After Hillary lost, she went for a walk in the woods, wrote books, did podcasts & traveled the world advocating for human rights & democracy at large.
She didn’t once call for the Constitution to be terminated.

But do go on about how women are “too emotional to lead” won’t you.

 — 
Facebook parent company Meta on Wednesday said it is laying off 11,000 employees, marking the most significant job cuts in the tech giant’s history.
The job cuts come as Meta confronts a range of challenges to its core business and makes an uncertain and costly bet on pivoting to the metaverse. It also comes amid a spate of layoffs at other tech firms in recent months as the high-flying sector reacts to high inflation, rising interest rates and fears of a looming recession.
“Today I’m sharing some of the most difficult changes we’ve made in Meta’s history,” CEO Mark Zuckerberg wrote in a blog post to employees. “I’ve decided to reduce the size of our team by about 13% and let more than 11,000 of our talented employees go.”
Facebook became Meta one year ago. Its metaverse dream feels as far away as ever
The job cuts will impact many corners of the company, but Meta’s recruiting team will be hit particularly hard as “we’re planning to hire fewer people next year,” Zuckerberg said in the post. He added that a hiring freeze would be extended until the first quarter, with few exceptions.
In September, Meta had a headcount of more than 87,000, per a September SEC filing.
Meta’s core ad sales business has been hit by privacy changes implemented by Apple, advertisers tightening budgets and heightened competition from newer rivals like TikTok. Meanwhile, Meta has been spending billions to build a future version of the internet, dubbed the metaverse, that likely remains years away from widespread acceptance.
Last month, the company posted its second quarterly revenue decline and said that its profit was cut in half from the prior year. Once valued at more than $1 trillion last year, Meta’s market value has since plunged to around $250 billion.
“I want to take accountability for these decisions and for how we got here,” Zuckerberg wrote in his post Wednesday. “I know this is tough for everyone, and I’m especially sorry to those impacted.”
Shares of Meta rose 5% in trading Wednesday following the announcement.
Meta is not alone in feeling the pain of a market downturn. The tech sector has been facing a dizzying reality check as inflation, rising interest rates and more macroeconomic headwinds have led to a stunning shift in spending for an industry that only grew more dominant as consumers shifted more of their lives online during the pandemic.
“At the start of Covid, the world rapidly moved online and the surge of e-commerce led to outsized revenue growth,” Zuckerberg wrote Wednesday. “Many people predicted this would be a permanent acceleration that would continue even after the pandemic ended. I did too, so I made the decision to significantly increase our investments. Unfortunately, this did not play out the way I expected.”
“I got this wrong, and I take responsibility for that,” he added.
Meta’s headcount in September was nearly twice the 48,268 staffers it had at the start of the pandemic in March of 2020.
A handful of tech companies have announced hiring freezes or job cuts in recent months, often after having seen rapid growth during the pandemic. Last week, rideshare company Lyft said it was axing 13% of employees, and payment-processing firm Stripe said it was cutting 14% of its staff. The same day, e-commerce giant Amazon said it was implementing a pause on corporate hiring.
Also last week, Facebook-rival Twitter announced mass layoffs impacting roles across the company as its new owner, Elon Musk, took the helm.
In addition to the layoffs, Zuckerberg said the company expects to “roll out more cost-cutting changes” in the coming months. Meta, which like other tech giants is known for its vast, perk-filled offices, is rethinking its real estate needs, he said, and “transitioning to desk sharing for people who already spend most of their time outside the office.”
“Overall,” he said, “this will add up to a meaningful cultural shift in how we operate.”

Updated 11:29 PM ET, Fri November 11, 2022
What we're covering here
Control of the Senate and House still in the balance: All eyes are on undecided Arizona and Nevada Senate races, as Georgia's contest heads to a Dec. 6 runoff. At least 400,000 votes remain to be counted in Arizona's Maricopa County alone, officials said.
Democrats flip key Senate seat: Democrat John Fetterman flipped Pennsylvania's Senate seat, CNN projected, boosting Democratic hopes of keeping their majority. Both parties now need two seats to win control of the Senate.
Biden addresses the country: President Biden called the midterms a ""good day for America,"" noting that the ""giant red wave"" that was predicted didn't happen and that it's still possible that Democrats hold the House.
Historic firsts: Both parties are diversifying their ranks. Here's a look at the candidates CNN projects will make history.

Here's why the Georgia Senate race may be headed to a run-off 
From CNN's Gregory Krieg

The hotly contested Senate contest in Georgia is too early to call, with Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock and Republican challenger Herschel Walker locked in a tight race that could decide control of the US Senate.
Remember: If neither candidate surpasses the 50% threshold, Warnock and Walker will proceed to a Dec. 6 run-off. Depending on the outcome of Senate races in Pennsylvania, Arizona and Nevada, voters in Georgia could then – for the second consecutive election cycle – have the Senate majority in their hands.
That the race is so close underscores the prevalence of ticket-splitters in Georgia this year. Republican Gov. Brian Kemp comfortably defeated Democrat Stacey Abrams, CNN projected, but Walker has lagged Kemp’s margin all night, while Warnock has outpaced Abrams.
In brief remarks on Tuesday night, Walker asked supporters gathered in a hotel ballroom to “hang in there a little bit longer.”
“I’m telling you right now – I didn’t come to lose,” Walker said.
Warnock has not yet addressed the crowd at his election night headquarters. But on Monday night, he joked to CNN about a potential run-off campaign.
“I think that there is bipartisan agreement that we (would) rather not have politics and Thanksgiving mixed together,” Warnock said.

Some 2020 election deniers will win secretary of state races, CNN projects
From CNN's Daniel Dale 
Some Republican candidates who have denied or refused to affirm the results of the 2020 election will be elected as state elections chief, CNN projects — though others will be defeated.
Here are three Republican secretary of state winners CNN has projected so far: 
Alabama: State Rep. Wes Allen, who endorsed the Texas-led legal effort to get the Supreme Court to overturn Joe Biden’s victory.
Indiana: Diego Morales, a former Mike Pence aide who wrote an article during the 2022 primary in which he falsely called the 2020 election a “scam” and wrongly said “the outcome is questionable.”
South Dakota: Monae Johnson, who repeatedly refused in an October 2022 interview to say that she accepted that Biden won the 2020 election legitimately.
In addition, Republican candidate Chuck Gray of Wyoming ran unopposed for secretary of state in the general election after winning the Republican primary. 
Here are five election deniers CNN projects will lose their 2022 races:
Massachusetts: Rayla Campbell, who falsely claimed Donald Trump was the real winner of a “stolen” 2020 election.
Minnesota: Kim Crockett, who baselessly said Minnesota’s 2020 election was “lawless” and that she agreed with an interviewer who called it “illegitimate.”
New Mexico: Audrey Trujillo, who also falsely claimed the 2020 election was “stolen” from Trump. 
Vermont: H. Brooke Paige, another candidate who falsely claimed the left “stole” the election.
Michigan: Kristina Karamo, who also falsely claimed in a social media video in December 2020 “Donald Trump won Michigan.”
CNN found that at least 12 Republican candidates for secretary of state have questioned, rejected or tried to overturn the results of the 2020 election. CNN had not yet projected the other races as of midnight ET on Wednesday morning.

Here are key takeaways from the midterm elections so far — and where things stand in the balance of power

The battle for control of Congress – both the House and the Senate – is coming down to a dwindling number of key races, with Democrats dashing Republicans’ hopes for a red wave and both parties hanging onto hopes of winning narrow majorities.
Republicans began the night with a rout in Florida, where Gov. Ron DeSantis won heavily Latino, historically Democratic regions on his way to a blowout victory that could serve as a launch pad for a 2024 presidential run.
But in the hours that have followed, Democrats have fought back. In Pennsylvania, Democratic Lt. Gov. John Fetterman defeated Republican Mehmet Oz for the seat of retiring Republican Sen. Pat Toomey.
Meanwhile, the battle for the House majority – one that favored Republicans, who expected to benefit from high inflation, historical trends and friendly new district lines after 2021’s redistricting – remains unsettled.
Here are some key takeaways as votes continue to be counted in key races:
Democrats go a long way to protecting their Senate majority: Republicans were not shy about the importance of Pennsylvania’s Senate race: “This is a must-win race. We believe if we win Pennsylvania, we win the majority,” said Steven Law, president of the preeminent Republican Senate super PAC. Early on Wednesday morning, CNN projected that Fetterman would be the next senator from Pennsylvania, defeating Oz in the most expensive and high stakes Senate campaign in the country. Fetterman’s win was a thunderclap for Democrats.
Democrats and the suburbs: Suburban areas across the country went a long way to helping Democrats avoid a significant red wave. Republicans may still win the House, but if the 2022 election was going to be a red wave, it was likely to come through suburban victories that have not materialized yet. Republicans did score some suburban victories – CNN projected Brandon Ogles the winner in a district around Nashville, Tom Kean Jr. winning in a suburban New Jersey district and Rich McCormick the victor in a district that included Atlanta’s northern suburbs – but it was their defeats that spoke volumes about the size of the GOP wave.
Virginia’s split decision offers early signals: Three Democratic-controlled House races in Virginia were widely viewed as an early warning signal of the night’s results. Democrats held seats in two Virginia districts Biden won in 2020. CNN projected that Democratic Jennifer Wexton won her reelection bid in Virginia’s 10th District. In an even more competitive race, CNN projected Rep. Abigail Spanberger also won reelection in Virginia’s 7th District. But Democrats lost in southeastern Virginia, with CNN projecting that Republican state Sen. Jen Kiggans defeated Democratic Rep. Elaine Luria.
Another Jan. 6 committee member loses: Luria, a member of the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, lost her Virginia Beach-based House seat, CNN projected. She had defeated former GOP Rep. Scott Taylor in 2018 and 2020. But the district had become slightly more favorable ground for Republicans in redistricting: Biden carried the previous version by 5 points, and would have lost the new district by 2 points.

DeSantis and 2024: Gov. Ron DeSantis led a dominant Republican ticket in Florida – delivering historic margins in Democratic territory in his victory over Democratic Rep. Charlie Crist on a night that provides him a powerful argument if he seeks the GOP’s 2024 presidential nomination. The easy wins by DeSantis, who led by nearly 20 percentage points with 92% of the estimated vote counted, and Sen. Marco Rubio, who was 17 points up, were enough to cast doubt on Florida’s status as a national bellwether.
GOP makes gains with Latinos in Florida: Republicans hoped to build on Trump’s inroads among Latino voters in 2020, a trend that could reshape the political landscapes in several swing states if it continues. The strongest early signal that the GOP had continued to make gains came in Miami-Dade County, home to a large Cuban population. But it’ll take a while to fully gauge whether those GOP gains take place outside of Florida.
Win for abortion rights: In Michigan, Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer – who staked her reelection campaign on her successful efforts to block the enforcement of the state’s 1931 law banning abortion in almost all instances – defeated Republican challenger Tudor Dixon, who had waged a campaign focused on cultural battles. Michigan voters also approved a Whitmer-backed amendment to the state’s constitution that will scrap that 1931 law and guarantee abortion rights. Voters in California and Vermont also green-lit constitutional amendments enshrining abortion rights.
A night of firsts: Up and down the ballot, in red states and blue, candidates from both parties are celebrating pathbreaking victories. Read about some of them here.

What we covered here
Control of Senate and House still hang in the balance: It's too early to call key races — including in Nevada, Georgia, Wisconsin and Arizona — that could determine which party controls the chambers. Dozens of governorships, secretaries of states and attorneys general are also on the line.
First Senate flip of the night: Democrat John Fetterman will win Pennsylvania's Senate seat, CNN projects, and defeat Trump-backed Republican Mehmet Oz. The pick up is a big boost to Democrats' hopes of clinging to the Senate as the red wave that Republicans hoped for has yet to materialize in the House.
Historic firsts: Both parties are diversifying their ranks. Here's a look at the candidates CNN projects will make history.

From recreational marijuana to voting initiatives, here are the latest decisions on key ballot measures

Voters around the country weighed in on key ballot measures on Tuesday, including initiatives that require IDs to vote and others that would legalize recreational marijuana.
Here's what we know so far:
Marijuana
Arkansas voters reject recreational marijuana ballot initiative: Arkansas voters on Tuesday rejected a constitutional amendment that would have allowed cannabis possession and recreational consumption by adults as well as the sale by licensed facilities, CNN projects. Had it passed, cannabis possession of up to an ounce would have been legal and some tax revenue from marijuana sales would have contributed to funding law enforcement.
Maryland legalizes recreational marijuana with ballot measure: Maryland voters on Tuesday approved a constitutional amendment that legalizes recreational marijuana for people 21 and older. It will go into effect on July 1, 2023, and allow possession of 1.5 ounces or two plants. Possession of small amounts of marijuana was already decriminalized in Maryland. Under the amendment, those previously convicted of cannabis possession and intent to distribute will be able to apply for record expungement. 
Voters end prohibitions on marijuana in Missouri: Missouri voters on Tuesday approved a constitutional amendment that ends prohibitions on marijuana in the state and allows personal use for those or those over the age of 21, CNN projects. It will allow personal possession up to 3 ounces. Additionally, the amendment allows individuals with marijuana-related non-violent offenses to petition for release from prison or parole and probation and have their records expunged. The amendment, which will be enacted 30 days after the election, prohibits marijuana facilities from selling cannabis-infused products shaped or packaged as candy that may be attractive to children. 
North Dakota voters reject ballot measure to legalize recreational marijuana: A citizen-initiated ballot measure that aimed to allow the use of marijuana in ""various forms"" for those who are at least 21 years-old was rejected by North Dakota voters, CNN projects. It would have allowed marijuana possession of up to an ounce and all marijuana is to be tested in a facility ""for the potency of products and the presence of pesticides"" and subject to random inspection. Legalization was on the ballot in four other states this November. 
South Dakota voters reject proposal to legalize recreational marijuana: Voters in South Dakota rejected a ballot measure that aimed to legalize marijuana for recreational use in the state, CNN projects. Marijuana legalization previously passed in 2020, but South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem’s office championed efforts to nullify the legalization saying that it violated the state’s constitution. The Republican governor’s office previously indicated to CNN that the 2022 measure appears to be written constitutionally and she would have implemented it if it passed. 
Voting
Nebraska voters approve measure to require ID to cast ballot: Nebraska voters have approved an initiative that would amend the state constitution to require that voters present a valid photo identification in a way that is specified by the legislature, CNN projects. To pass, “yes” needed to win a majority and votes equal to at least 35% of total votes cast in the election. 
Connecticut passes ballot measure to allow early voting: Connecticut voters have approved a measure that would amend the state constitution to permit the legislature to enact early voting, CNN projects.

Here are some key takeaways from Election Night — and where things stand now 
From CNN's Eric Bradner, Dan Merica and Gregory Krieg
The battle for control of Congress – both the House and the Senate – is coming down to a dwindling number of key races, with Democrats dashing Republicans’ hopes for a red wave and both parties hanging onto hopes of winning narrow majorities.
Republicans began the night with a rout in Florida, where Gov. Ron DeSantis won heavily Latino, historically Democratic regions on his way to a blowout victory that could serve as a launch pad for a 2024 presidential run.
But in the hours that have followed, Democrats have fought back. In Pennsylvania, Democratic Lt. Gov. John Fetterman defeated Republican Mehmet Oz for the seat of retiring Republican Sen. Pat Toomey.
Meanwhile, the battle for the House majority – one that favored Republicans, who expected to benefit from high inflation, historical trends and friendly new district lines after 2021’s redistricting – remains unsettled.
Here are some key takeaways as votes continue to be counted in key races:
Democrats go a long way to protecting their Senate majority: Republicans were not shy about the importance of Pennsylvania’s Senate race: “This is a must-win race. We believe if we win Pennsylvania, we win the majority,” said Steven Law, president of the preeminent Republican Senate super PAC. Early on Wednesday morning, CNN projected that Fetterman would be the next senator from Pennsylvania, defeating Oz in the most expensive and high stakes Senate campaign in the country. Fetterman’s win was a thunderclap for Democrats.
Democrats and the suburbs: Suburban areas across the country went a long way to helping Democrats avoid a significant red wave. Republicans may still win the House, but if the 2022 election was going to be a red wave, it was likely to come through suburban victories that have not materialized yet. Republicans did score some suburban victories – CNN projected Brandon Ogles the winner in a district around Nashville, Tom Kean Jr. winning in a suburban New Jersey district and Rich McCormick the victor in a district that included Atlanta’s northern suburbs – but it was their defeats that spoke volumes about the size of the GOP wave.
Virginia’s split decision offers early signals: Three Democratic-controlled House races in Virginia were widely viewed as an early warning signal of the night’s results. Democrats held seats in two Virginia districts Biden won in 2020. CNN projected that Democratic Jennifer Wexton won her reelection bid in Virginia’s 10th District. In an even more competitive race, CNN projected Rep. Abigail Spanberger also won reelection in Virginia’s 7th District. But Democrats lost in southeastern Virginia, with CNN projecting that Republican state Sen. Jen Kiggans defeated Democratic Rep. Elaine Luria.
Another Jan. 6 committee member loses: Luria, a member of the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, lost her Virginia Beach-based House seat, CNN projected. She had defeated former GOP Rep. Scott Taylor in 2018 and 2020. But the district had become slightly more favorable ground for Republicans in redistricting: Biden carried the previous version by 5 points, and would have lost the new district by 2 points.
DeSantis and 2024: Gov. Ron DeSantis led a dominant Republican ticket in Florida – delivering historic margins in Democratic territory in his victory over Democratic Rep. Charlie Crist on a night that provides him a powerful argument if he seeks the GOP’s 2024 presidential nomination. The easy wins by DeSantis, who led by nearly 20 percentage points with 92% of the estimated vote counted, and Sen. Marco Rubio, who was 17 points up, were enough to cast doubt on Florida’s status as a national bellwether.
GOP makes gains with Latinos in Florida: Republicans hoped to build on Trump’s inroads among Latino voters in 2020, a trend that could reshape the political landscapes in several swing states if it continues. The strongest early signal that the GOP had continued to make gains came in Miami-Dade County, home to a large Cuban population. But it’ll take a while to fully gauge whether those GOP gains take place outside of Florida.
Win for abortion rights: In Michigan, Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer – who staked her reelection campaign on her successful efforts to block the enforcement of the state’s 1931 law banning abortion in almost all instances – defeated Republican challenger Tudor Dixon, who had waged a campaign focused on cultural battles. Michigan voters also approved a Whitmer-backed amendment to the state’s constitution that will scrap that 1931 law and guarantee abortion rights. Voters in California and Vermont also green-lit constitutional amendments enshrining abortion rights.
A night of firsts: Up and down the ballot, in red states and blue, candidates from both parties are celebrating pathbreaking victories. Read about some of them here.

Maricopa County will post additional results on Wednesday night

 Election Day ballots from all 223 sites in Maricopa County, the most populous county in Arizona, have been reported as of 1:55 a.m local time, according to a tweet from the county’s elections department.
Additional results are expected to be posted Wednesday night, the county said.
As of 1:59 a.m. local time, with 90% of statewide precincts reporting, the Democratic candidates for the senate, governor and secretary of state were in the lead.
Earlier in the day, Maricopa County experienced technical problems with tabulation devices at about 20% of its voting locations, county officials said Tuesday morning, but there was no indication of intentional malfeasance despite claims to the contrary.

Multiple vehement election deniers will lose their gubernatorial races, CNN projects
From CNN's Daniel Dale 
Some of the most aggressive deniers of the 2020 election results will lose their 2022 gubernatorial races, CNN projects.
CNN found that at least 22 of the 36 Republican candidates for governor have rejected, declined to affirm, raised doubts about, or tried to overturn President Joe Biden’s victory.
Here are some of the candidates CNN projects will lose:
Doug Mastriano of Pennsylvania, who made extensive efforts to try to overturn Biden’s win. (As governor, Mastriano would have had the power to appoint the state elections chief.)
Dan Cox of Maryland, who said he didn’t recognize Biden as the president and who co-organized buses to the “Stop the Steal” rally on January 6, 2021.
Paul LePage of Maine, who falsely claimed that 2020 was “clearly a stolen election.”
Lee Zeldin of New York, who, as a member of Congress, voted against certifying Biden’s victories in Pennsylvania and Arizona.
Geoff Diehl of Massachusetts, who said in mid-2021 that the election wasn’t stolen but by 2022 was saying that it was certainly stolen.
Scott Jensen of Minnesota, who refused to affirm the legitimacy of Biden’s win and who baselessly suggested imprisoning the state’s Democratic elections chief. 
Tim Michels of Wisconsin, who baselessly claimed that “President Trump probably would be president right now if we had election integrity.”
Tudor Dixon of Michigan, who falsely claimed Trump won Michigan in 2020 even though he actually lost by more than 154,000 votes. 
Heidi Ganahl of Colorado, who refused on multiple occasions to say whether Biden was the legitimate winner and then selected a promoter of false election conspiracy theories as her running mate.
Some incumbents who denied or questioned the election results will win, CNN projects. They include:
Kay Ivey of Alabama, who ran an ad during her Republican primary that falsely claimed the 2020 election was stolen from Trump.
Brad Little of Idaho, who endorsed the Texas-led lawsuit in 2020 that sought to get the Supreme Court to overturn Biden’s win.
Kim Reynolds of Iowa, who expressed support for that Texas-led lawsuit (though she later said Biden was legitimately elected).
Greg Abbott of Texas, who also expressed support for the lawsuit led by the attorney general of his state. 
Kristi Noem of South Dakota, who baselessly claimed on Twitter that Trump was fighting “rigged election systems” and hinted that there were issues in “Democrat-run” states.

CNN
 — 
Massive Hurricane Nicole was dumping rain on Florida Wednesday night as the storm bore down on the east coast of the Sunshine State, threatening to bring damaging winds and heavy precipitation to some places still recovering from Hurricane Ian.
Earlier the storm battered the Bahamas while strengthening from a tropical storm to a Category 1 hurricane.

The eye of Nicole is expected to make landfall on the Florida coast late Wednesday or early Thursday, according to the US National Hurricane Center.
Follow live updates >>
Nicole is on a path to be the first hurricane to make landfall in the United States in November in nearly 40 years.
Here are the latest developments:
• Nicole has sustained winds of up to 75 mph after passing over the Bahamas.
• Tropical storm-force winds extend up to 485 miles from Nicole’s center, the hurricane center said. The enormous wind field – wider than that of stronger Ian on its Florida approach – means nearly the whole state will feel winds of 39 mph or greater from Nicole.
• More than 5.3 million people are under hurricane warnings and 4.1 million are under a hurricane watch.
• Around 3 to 8 inches are possible from the northwestern Bahamas to the eastern, central and northern portions of Florida. About 2 to 6 inches are expected from parts of the US southeast to the southern and central Appalachians and western mid-Atlantic through Friday, the hurricane center said.
• Coastal water levels could rise by as much as 6 feet above normal tide in the northwestern Bahamas, and up to 5 feet from Florida’s North Palm Beach to Georgia’s Altamaha Sound. Up to 4 feet of surge is possible to the south and north of that range, including through parts of South Carolina’s coast.
• Evacuations have been ordered. In some cases authorities say the buildings are unsafe, as 22 homes in Volusia County and some condo buildings in New Smyrna Beach were deemed.
• The St. John’s River, which flooded in some areas after Hurricane Ian, was approaching major flood stage near Astor and moderate flood stage near DeLand.

Here are some key takeaways from Election Night — and where things stand now 
From CNN's Eric Bradner, Dan Merica and Gregory Krieg
The battle for control of Congress – both the House and the Senate – is coming down to a dwindling number of key races, with Democrats dashing Republicans’ hopes for a red wave and both parties hanging onto hopes of winning narrow majorities.
Republicans began the night with a rout in Florida, where Gov. Ron DeSantis won heavily Latino, historically Democratic regions on his way to a blowout victory that could serve as a launch pad for a 2024 presidential run.

Multiple vehement election deniers will lose their gubernatorial races, CNN projects
From CNN's Daniel Dale 
Some of the most aggressive deniers of the 2020 election results will lose their 2022 gubernatorial races, CNN projects.
CNN found that at least 22 of the 36 Republican candidates for governor have rejected, declined to affirm, raised doubts about, or tried to overturn President Joe Biden’s victory.

Tudor Dixon of Michigan, who falsely claimed Trump won Michigan in 2020 even though he actually lost by more than 154,000 votes. 
Heidi Ganahl of Colorado, who refused on multiple occasions to say whether Biden was the legitimate winner and then selected a promoter of false election conspiracy theories as her running mate.
Some incumbents who denied or questioned the election results will win, CNN projects. They include:
Kay Ivey of Alabama, who ran an ad during her Republican primary that falsely claimed the 2020 election was stolen from Trump.
Brad Little of Idaho, who endorsed the Texas-led lawsuit in 2020 that sought to get the Supreme Court to overturn Biden’s win.
Kim Reynolds of Iowa, who expressed support for that Texas-led lawsuit (though she later said Biden was legitimately elected).
Greg Abbott of Texas, who also expressed support for the lawsuit led by the attorney general of his state. 
Kristi Noem of South Dakota, who baselessly claimed on Twitter that Trump was fighting “rigged election systems” and hinted that there were issues in “Democrat-run” states.

After Hillary lost, she went for a walk in the woods, wrote books, did podcasts & traveled the world advocating for human rights & democracy at large.
She didn’t once call for the Constitution to be terminated.

But do go on about how women are “too emotional to lead” won’t you.

What we covered here
Control of Senate and House still hang in the balance: It's too early to call key races — including in Nevada, Georgia, Wisconsin and Arizona — that could determine which party controls the chambers. Dozens of governorships, secretaries of states and attorneys general are also on the line.
First Senate flip of the night: Democrat John Fetterman will win Pennsylvania's Senate seat, CNN projects, and defeat Trump-backed Republican Mehmet Oz. The pick up is a big boost to Democrats' hopes of clinging to the Senate as the red wave that Republicans hoped for has yet to materialize in the House.
Historic firsts: Both parties are diversifying their ranks. Here's a look at the candidates CNN projects will make history.

As results continue to come in, here's a reminder of how CNN makes projections 
From CNN’s From CNN's Zachary B. Wolf and Ethan Cohen
As results continue to come in tonight, CNN will make projections on key races that will define which party will control each chamber Congress. 
Here's what you need to know about how CNN makes projections: 
What is a CNN “key race”? Who decides that? “Key race” is a subjective term. Most politics watchers generally agree that only a subset of races is truly competitive in November, and these are generally considered the key races. Political parties spend more money on these races. Reporters spend more time covering them. 
Of the 35 Senate races on the ballot in 2022, the election forecasters at Inside Elections considered three to be true toss-ups and another four to tilt toward either Republicans or Democrats. 
Nineteen House races are true toss-ups, although many more could wind up being closely contested. Five governor races are toss-ups. See the Inside Elections ratings for Senate, House and governor. 
Key races can also be races that might be less competitive but have broader implications or feature especially notable candidates. 
What factors help CNN make projections? Using a mix of many factors, including current and previous election results, real-time exit polling, recent opinion polls, voter registration data and more, CNN’s decision desk is frequently able to reliably project that a candidate has received enough support to win. It is a projection, however, and not the final word. State officials and courts have the official say. 
Can CNN project a race without any votes in? This is a task CNN takes very seriously. Based on previous election results, exit polling, recent opinion polls, early voter turnout and other factors, it is sometimes possible to see that one particular candidate will win a race. If there is any chance of an upset, CNN will refrain from projecting a race.

Democrat Wiley Nickel has defeated Republican Bo Hines in a competitive North Carolina House race for the 13th Congressional District, CNN projects. 
Nickel is a Democratic state senator. Hines is a 27-year-old political newcomer and former college football player who won former President Donald Trump’s endorsement ahead of the primary. As a result of Trump’s endorsement, the race has been viewed as a test of the former president’s influence.

Democratic Rep. Matt Cartwright will hold on to his seat in Pennsylvania’s 8th Congressional District, CNN projects, defeating Republican Jim Bognet in a second consecutive general election. 
Cartwright beat Bognet, a former political consultant, by only about three and a half percentage points in 2020 and was considered an underdog to defend the seat again this year. But his winning streak on increasingly red turf remains intact, even as his vote-share has trended down over the years.

Here are the key headlines and notable wins to know as race for control of Congress gets tighter
From CNN staff
With the balance of the House and Senate coming down to a handful of key states, the race for control is getting tighter.
Here are some of the key headlines from the midterms as results continue to come in:
Brad Raffensperger will stay Georgia’s election chief
Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, who refused former President Donald Trump's request to ""find"" the votes needed to overturn his 2020 loss in the Peach State, will win reelection, CNN projects. 
John Fetterman beats Mehmet Oz
Fetterman, the Democratic nominee, thanked supporters and those who voted for him after CNN projected he would win, saying, ""I never expected that we were going to turn these red counties blue. But we did what we needed to do.""
J.D. Vance takes Ohio Senate seat
Voters from union households in Ohio favored GOP Senate candidate J.D. Vance over his Democratic rival, Rep. Tim Ryan, which helped the Republican clinch the open seat, according to the early results of the Ohio exit poll conducted for CNN and other news networks by Edison Research.
Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has won reelection
Whitmer defeated Republican challenger Tudor Dixon in one of the nation’s most important political battleground states, CNN projects. Whitmer won a second term after a campaign that focused largely on her support for abortion rights in the wake of the Supreme Court’s reversal of Roe v. Wade.
Abortion on the ballot
Californians have voted to explicitly and more clearly protect abortion rights in the state by amending language in the state constitution.
Michigan also approved a ballot measure to enshrine abortion rights in the state���s constitution, a move that will block a decades-old abortion ban from taking effect, CNN projects.
Voters in Vermont approved an amendment that will protect ""every person's right to make their own reproductive decisions,"" including about pregnancies, abortion and birth control. 
Here's a look at how Michigan's voter turnout for the measure stacks up:

Exit polls: Voters who valued ""honesty and integrity"" favored Fetterman
From CNN's Ariel Edwards-Levy and Tami Luhby

Pennsylvania voters who most valued “honesty and integrity” in their Senate candidate favored Democrat John Fetterman over Republican Mehmet Oz, according to the early results of the Pennsylvania exit poll conducted for CNN and other news networks by Edison Research.
Fetterman also won among voters who said they wanted a candidate who cared about people like them, while Oz won among the smaller bloc of voters who prioritized a candidate sharing their values.
CNN projects that Fetterman will defeat Oz to win the open Pennsylvania Senate race, flipping a Republican-held seat.
A majority of female voters, White college-educated voters, voters of color and political independents supported Fetterman, the exit poll finds, while most male voters and White voters without college degrees supported Oz.
Most voters, about 53%, said they disapproved of President Joe Biden’s job performance. But roughly 14% of those who disapproved of Biden cast their ballots for Fetterman, as did nearly all of those who approved of the president. A slim majority of voters in the state said that Biden was not a factor in their vote, with most also saying former President Donald Trump did not play a role.
Voters were close to evenly split on whether or not Oz’s views were too extreme, while about 53% said Fetterman’s views were not.
Voters in Pennsylvania were closely split over whether Fetterman’s health was good enough to represent the state effectively. Fetterman, Pennsylvania’s lieutenant governor, suffered a near-fatal stroke days before the May Democratic primary.
But a majority of voters said that Oz has not lived in the commonwealth long enough to represent it effectively. Oz has said he moved to Pennsylvania in late 2020 after living in New Jersey for decades."
"Anatomy of a close election: How Americans voted in 2022 vs. 2018
Early exit polls show women and voters of color shifted toward the GOP
By Zachary B. Wolf and Curt Merrill, CNN
Published: November 9, 2022
Updated: 10:49 AM EST, Wed November 9, 2022
Data updated Nov. 9, 2022 2:14 PM ET
US voters did not deliver the red wave some Republicans had predicted and which Democrats had feared. As of early Wednesday morning, CNN had not projected which party would lead either the House or the Senate.
Democrats were able to escape the historical precedent of losing a large number of seats in a president’s first midterm, but lost some key support among their core constituencies. They notched key victories in states like Pennsylvania, but were swept away in a traditional battleground like Florida, which is acting more and more like a red state.
Republicans were unable to turn economic discontent and frustration with President Joe Biden into a broad mandate, although there are bright spots for them, such as turning Florida red and overperforming in Long Island congressional races. It’s important to note there’s a lot of variation across the country.
What’s below is a look at two very different midterm elections and who showed up for a blue wave in 2018, when Democrats picked up a net of 40 seats, and what’s shaping up to be a relatively close election in 2022. It is a breakdown of some preliminary results of CNN’s exit poll of pre-election and Election Day voters.
CNN’s 2022 exit polls include interviews with thousands of voters, both those who cast a ballot on Election Day and those who voted early or absentee. That scope makes them a powerful tool for understanding the demographic profile and political views of voters in this year's election. And their findings will eventually be weighted against the ultimate benchmark: the results of the elections themselves. Even so, exit polls are still polls, with margins for error — which means they're most useful when treated as estimates, rather than precise measurements. That's particularly true for the earliest exit poll numbers, which haven't yet been adjusted to match final election results.
CNN Exit Polls are a combination of in-person interviews with Election Day voters and in-person interviews, telephone and online polls measuring the views of early and absentee by-mail voters. They were conducted by Edison Research on behalf of the National Election Pool. In-person interviews on Election Day were conducted at a random sample of 250 polling locations. The results also include interviews with early and absentee voters conducted in person at 72 early voting locations, by phone or online. Results for the full sample of 15,234 respondents have a margin of error of plus or minus 2 percentage points; it is larger for subgroups.
Exit poll data for 2022 will continue to update and will automatically reflect in the charts below.
By gender
Democrats lost support among women in 2022 compared with 2018.
Men
2018

50%
Rep +4

Women

When Democrats took control of the House after the 2018 election, a little more than half of voters were women and the party had a huge advantage among them. Even though women represented a similar majority of voters in 2022, Democrats’ lead appears to be cut noticeably. Additionally, in 2022, Republicans grew their support among men.
Early exit polls confirmed that Americans do support abortion rights. Only a little more than a third of voters said abortion should be illegal in all or most cases. But while Republicans in the House won the support of nearly all of the voters who oppose abortion rights, they also got the support of a quarter of the voters who said it should be legal.
By age
Democrats lost support among younger voters in 2022 compared with 2018. Republicans won older voters.

Young voters have traditionally supported Democrats and winning them by huge margins helped the party in 2018. Republicans have eaten into that advantage this year.
Democrats and Republicans split older voters in 2018, but Republicans won majority support in 2022.
By race/ethnicity and gender
Republicans won over White women and Democrats lost support among Latino voters.

Republicans won a majority of White women, an important voting bloc the two parties split in 2018. Republicans also made good on predictions that they would perform better among Latino voters than they did four years ago. Democrats’ support among Latino men was 63% in 2018 and is under 55% in 2022, according to the early exit polls. Republicans appeared to cut into Democrats’ advantage among Latino women, although Democrats still got the support of about two-thirds of them.

Most American voters lived in the suburbs in both 2018 and 2022. But while suburban voters were evenly split when Democrats took control of the House four years ago, they moved toward Republicans in 2022. An already-strong Republican lead among rural voters got even bigger and Republicans even ate into Democrats’ lead in urban areas.

With a Republican president in 2018, more Republicans said the economy was in good condition. In 2022, with a Democratic president, Democrats are likely to see it as better. Overall, more than two-thirds of all voters said the economy was excellent or good in 2018 — and in 2022, it’s just a quarter of voters.

Voters deliver ringing endorsement of abortion rights on midterm ballot initiatives across the US

 — 
Voters in key states on Tuesday made their support for abortion rights clear, affirming a months-long push by Democrats to act on a number of ballot measures in the wake of the Supreme Court’s decision overturning Roe v. Wade.
Several states moved to enshrine abortion protections in their constitutions and others rejected proposals to limit abortion access or criminalize doctors in some cases. Democratic lawmakers and organizers cast the midterm elections as a referendum on Republican efforts to limit women’s choices, and the notable electoral reaction could serve as a warning sign for future GOP efforts to restrict the procedure at the state-level.
About 27% of voters cited abortion as the issue most important to them, according to the preliminary results of the national and state exit polls conducted for CNN and other news networks by Edison Research. The results also showed that when it comes to the issue, roughly half of voters said they trusted Democratic candidates, compared with more than 4 in 10 voters who said they trusted Republican candidates.
“This fall, Roe is on the ballot,” President Joe Biden declared in a defiant speech from the White House just hours after the Supreme Court’s ruling earlier this year.
While CNN projected some anti-abortion Republicans will win their races, voters in five states moved to affirm abortion rights.
Here’s a running list of what voters decided on Election Day.
Montana rejects abortion measure that would allow criminal penalties on health care providers
Voters in Montana rejected on Tuesday proposed legislation that would have imposed criminal penalties on health care providers who do not act to preserve the life of infants born during the course of an abortion, CNN projects.
LR-131, if adopted, would have provided that an infant “born alive” – defined as an infant “at any stage of development” who breathes, has a beating heart or definite movement of voluntary muscles after expulsion or extraction – be treated as a legal person entitled to medical treatment.
A health care provider who violated the proposed law would have been guilty of a felony and could have faced up to 20 years in state prison and/or a fine of up to $50,000. It would have also mandated that health care providers and clinics report “a failure to comply with the requirements” to law enforcement.
Montana currently prohibits abortions past viability – “the ability of a fetus to live outside the mother’s womb” – except to save the life or health of the woman.
Last year, the state’s Republican-led legislature passed the bill that put the referendum on the ballot.
Backers of the measure said such a law was necessary to protect infants born during an abortion attempt, while opponents said the bill wasn’t needed because there are laws in place that require care to be given.
Hillary-Anne Crosby, the campaign coordinator and communications lead for Compassion for Montana Families, previously said LR-131 “zeroes in on families that are having complications in the labor and delivery room, such as lethal fetal abnormalities.”
“It’s not uncommon for families to make the decision to induce labor so that they can hold their infant for a few minutes, maybe have family come in and be able to meet their new family member for the few moments that they are alive, and LR-131 throws a wrench in that being a viable option to them without the health care workers facing a felony,” she previously told CNN.
Kentucky rejects proposal that would have further restricted abortion rights
Kentucky voters on Tuesday rejected a proposal to amend the state’s constitution to say that it does not “secure or protect a right” to abortion or the funding of abortion, CNN projects.
The ballot question voters faced read: “Are you in favor of amending the Constitution of Kentucky by creating a new Section of the Constitution to be numbered Section 26A to state as follows: To protect human life, nothing in this Constitution shall be construed to secure or protect a right to abortion or require the funding of abortion?”
Takeaways from the 2022 midterm elections: Battle for control of the House and Senate still up in the air
Kentucky’s “trigger law,” which bans most abortions at all stages of pregnancy, and a law banning abortion after roughly six weeks of pregnancy have been allowed to be enforced temporarily while a lawsuit challenging the laws continues.
Kentucky Right to Life executive director Addia Wuchner, who chairs the Yes for Life Alliance, which supported Amendment 2, previously said voting “yes” would “ensure there’s no false interpretation of the constitution.”
Without the amendment, “instead of the lawmakers who duly reflect the people’s will, we would end up with the abortion industry taking each law back into court,” Wuchner said.
Tamarra Wieder, the Kentucky state director for Planned Parenthood Alliance Advocates, had said passing the amendment would “open the door to more attacks on abortion access,” but rejecting it would allow abortion rights advocates to “continue to fight back” against the six-week ban and the trigger ban.
If adopted, the measure would have gone into effect immediately once the results of the election are certified by the State Board of Elections.
Michigan enshrines abortion rights
Michigan voters on Tuesday voted to enshrine abortion rights in the state’s constitution, a move that will help block a decades-old abortion ban from taking effect, CNN projects.
The passage of ballot Proposal 3 amends the Michigan constitution to establish an “individual right to reproductive freedom, including right to make and carry out all decisions about pregnancy.”
Michigan has a 1931 law that essentially bans abortion in the state, but that law is being blocked by the courts. The passage of the ballot proposal helps prevent the ban from taking effect.
The amendment allows the state to regulate abortion after fetal viability, except if needed to protect a patient’s life or physical or mental health. It also bars the state from prosecuting an individual for having an abortion or miscarriage or from prosecuting someone who assists a pregnant person in “exercising rights established by this amendment.”
The proposal had to overcome legal challenges to be included on the ballot, with the Michigan Supreme Court ordering officials in September to include the question on ballots in a 5-2 ruling.
“We are energized and motivated now more than ever to restore the protections that were lost under Roe,” Darci McConnell, a spokesperson for Reproductive Freedom for All, a group backing the effort, said in a statement after the ruling.
Michigan Republicans had blasted the court’s decision, along with another on a voting rights ballot proposal. “Despite the court ruling, these measures remain too extreme for Michigan, and we are certain they will be handily defeated at the ballot box in November,” Elizabeth Giannone, deputy communications director for the state party, predicted in a statement earlier this year.
California voters put abortion rights in state constitution
The California Constitution will protect the right to an abortion after residents on Tuesday passed a ballot initiative to enshrine the right in the state’s governing document, CNN projects.
Currently, the state constitution guarantees a right to privacy, which the California Supreme Court has ruled includes the right to have an abortion.
In May, following the leak of the US Supreme Court’s draft opinion to overturn Roe v. Wade, California Democratic leaders Gov. Gavin Newsom, state Senate President Pro Tempore Toni Atkins and state Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon said in a statement that they would propose an amendment “so that there is no doubt as to the right to abortion in this state.”
The Democratic-controlled state legislature in June approved putting the amendment on the November ballot.
“Proposition 1 ensures that no matter what the future legislature looks like, what the future governor looks like, that people in California have a constitutional protection that explicitly ensures the state won’t interfere with their right to reproductive freedom,” Jodi Hicks, the head of Planned Parenthood Affiliates of California and co-chair of the Yes on Prop 1 campaign, previously told CNN.
The California Family Council had said the proposed amendment is an “extreme and costly proposal that does nothing to advance women’s health.” And the California Catholic Conference, which opposes Proposition 1, called it a “misleading ballot measure that allows unlimited late-term abortions – for any reason, at any time, even moments before birth, paid for by tax dollars.”
The Yes on Prop 1 campaign previously said the proposal would not change “existing state constitutional protections and law, which provide for the right to choose an abortion prior to viability or to protect the pregnant person’s life or health.”
The measure goes into effect the fifth day after the vote is certified.
Vermont voters back abortion rights
Voters in Vermont on Tuesday approved an amendment to the state’s constitution that abortion rights supporters say will protect “every person’s right to make their own reproductive decisions,” including about pregnancies, abortion and birth control, CNN projects.
The Vermont Constitution will now be amended to read: “That an individual’s right to personal reproductive autonomy is central to the liberty and dignity to determine one’s own life course and shall not be denied or infringed unless justified by a compelling State interest achieved by the least restrictive means.”
Abortion is currently legal at all stages of pregnancy in Vermont. The proposed amendment was first brought by the Vermont Legislature in 2019.
Vermont for Reproductive Liberty Ballot Committee, the coalition that backed Article 22, had previously said state-level protections “are vital to safeguarding access” now that the US Supreme Court has overturned Roe v. Wade.
“It would mean that abortion access has been codified in the state constitution, and really the most important part of that is that it’s protected long-term, and it means that access is going to be there, no matter what our politicians do,” Sam Donnelly, the campaign manager for the coalition, previously told CNN.
Both supporters and opponents of Article 22 have said its adoption means that Vermont lawmakers will be unable to pass any limitations or regulations on abortion in the future because it would then be deemed unconstitutional.
Mary Beerworth, the executive director of the Vermont Right to Life Committee, which opposes the amendment, had said the proposal goes “way, way further” than codifying abortion rights into the state constitution.
“It will be about a vast range of anything that pertains to your personal reproductive autonomy, from surrogacy, three-parent embryo, designer babies, minors possibly accessing the hormone blockers for transgender surgery without their parents’ knowledge or consent,” she previously told CNN. “It’s opening a whole new world here if it passes.”

Brittney Griner begins transfer to Russian penal colony, attorneys say
By Abby Phillip and Rhea Mogul, CNN
Updated 5:52 PM EST, Wed November 9, 2022

Watch Brittney Griner speak before Russian court upheld conviction
03:33 - Source: CNN
CNN
 — 
US women’s basketball star Brittney Griner is being moved to a Russian penal colony where she is due to serve the remainder of a nine-year drug smuggling sentence that was upheld in late October.
Griner “is now on her way to a penal colony,” her attorneys said in a statement to CNN on Wednesday.
Russia's penal colonies are often grim, cramped facilities. Here's what could await Brittney Griner
“We do not have any information on her exact current location or her final destination,” said attorneys Maria Blagovolina and Alexander Boykov. “In accordance with the standard Russian procedure, the attorneys, as well as the US Embassy, should be notified upon her arrival at her destination. Notification is given via official mail and normally takes up to two weeks to be received.”
Russian penal colonies are known for their lack of hygiene and access to medical care, with inmates often required to perform manual labor.
Last month, Griner lost her appeal of her sentence. She was detained in February and convicted in August of smuggling drugs into Russia.
She has repeatedly apologized for bringing a small amount of cannabis into the country, where she played basketball in the off-season.
In a statement, Griner’s representatives said they don’t know where she is – or what her condition is.
“Our primary concern continues to be BG’s health and well-being,” Griner’s agent, Lindsay Colas, said. “As we work through this very difficult phase of not knowing exactly where BG is or how she is doing, we ask for the public’s support in continuing to write letters and express their love and care for her.”
US diplomatic efforts
Brittney Griner faces bleak life in Russian penal colony
Russia “unfortunately followed past practice” and did not notify the United States ahead of moving Griner, a senior State Department official said Wedneday. While US officials expected Griner would be transferred, they found out about the move from her legal team and press reports.
US diplomats have asked Russia for information on Griner but Russia hasn’t provided any answers, the official said.
“We are communicating very clearly to the Russians requesting information on her current location as well as her destination in addition to the message that we expect consistent with their obligations, including under under the Vienna Convention, to have a consistent consular access to Brittney Griner,” the official said.
Griner’s detention has raised concerns that she is being used as a political pawn in Russia’s war against Ukraine.
The US government condemned the denial of her appeal last week, with a State Department spokesperson calling it “another repudiation of justice, which only compounds the original injustice of her detention.”
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken called news of Griner’s transfer “another injustice layered on her ongoing unjust and wrongful detention.”
“As we work to secure Brittney Griner’s release, we expect Russian authorities to provide our Embassy officials with regular access to all U.S. citizens detained in Russia, including Brittney, as is their obligation,” Blinken said in a statement Wednesday. “Ensuring the health and welfare of U.S. citizen detainees in Russia is a priority, and we will continue to press for fair and transparent treatment for them all.”
Biden says he is ‘determined’ to bring Griner home
President Joe Biden said Wednesday he hopes Russia will talk more seriously about a prisoner exchange following Tuesday’s midterm elections.
“My intention is to get her home, and we have had a number of discussions so far. And I am hopeful that now that our election is over, there’s a willingness to negotiate more specifically with this,” Biden said at a news conference.
“I’m telling you, I am determined to get her home and get her home safely, along with others, I might add,” Biden said.
American officials “continue to work relentlessly to bring home” both Griner and Paul Whelan, another American held in Russia, who was sentenced to 16 years in prison after he was convicted of espionage – charges he denies.
“We will not relent until they are reunited with their loved ones,” Blinken said Wednesday.

"WATCH LIVE: CNN's special coverage of midterm election results
2022 midterm election results
By Aditi Sangal, Adrienne Vogt, Elise Hammond, Maureen Chowdhury, Clare Foran, Meg Wagner, Melissa Macaya, Joe Ruiz and Seán Federico-OMurchú, CNN
Updated 5:55 a.m. ET, November 9, 2022
What we covered here
Control of Senate and House still hang in the balance: It's too early to call key races — including in Nevada, Georgia, Wisconsin and Arizona — that could determine which party controls the chambers. Dozens of governorships, secretaries of states and attorneys general are also on the line.
First Senate flip of the night: Democrat John Fetterman will win Pennsylvania's Senate seat, CNN projects, and defeat Trump-backed Republican Mehmet Oz. The pick up is a big boost to Democrats' hopes of clinging to the Senate as the red wave that Republicans hoped for has yet to materialize in the House.
Historic firsts: Both parties are diversifying their ranks. Here's a look at the candidates CNN projects will make history.

CNN Projection: Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer will win reelection bid

Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has won reelection, CNN projects, defeating Republican challenger Tudor Dixon in one of the nation’s most important political battleground states. 
Whitmer won a second term after a campaign that focused largely on her support for abortion rights in the wake of the Supreme Court’s reversal of Roe v. Wade.
She successfully sued to block the enforcement of Michigan’s 1931 abortion ban, and also championed a citizens’ initiative on this fall’s ballot that would amend the state’s constitution to guarantee abortion rights. 
Her victory cements Whitmer’s place -- two years after she was a finalist for President Joe Biden’s vice presidential pick -- as a leading figure within the Democratic Party moving forward. 
And it demonstrates the limits of voters’ willingness to punish officials in competitive states who took strict measures to combat the coronavirus pandemic, including school and business closures.

Voters in Vermont approved an amendment to the state’s constitution to further protect abortion rights, CNN projects. 
The amendment, supporters say, will protect ""every person's right to make their own reproductive decisions,"" including about pregnancies, abortion and birth control. 
The Vermont Constitution will now be amended to read: ""That an individual's right to personal reproductive autonomy is central to the liberty and dignity to determine one's own life course and shall not be denied or infringed unless justified by a compelling State interest achieved by the least restrictive means.""

Exit polls: About half of New Hampshire voters saw Don Bolduc’s views as too extreme
From CNN's Ariel Edwards-Levy
Don Bolduc greets the crowd before results are announced, in Manchester, New Hampshire, on November 8.
About half of New Hampshire voters called Republican Senate candidate Don Bolduc’s views “too extreme,” according to the early results of the New Hampshire exit poll conducted for CNN and other news networks by Edison Research.
Only about 43% said the same of his Democratic rival, incumbent Sen. Maggie Hassan.
CNN projects that Hassan will win a second Senate term in New Hampshire, defeating the Trump-backed Bolduc.
President Joe Biden’s job approval rating in the state is negative, per the exit poll, with only about 42% of voters approving. But roughly 1 in 5 Biden disapprovers, nevertheless, cast their vote for Hassan.
Roughly three-quarters of voters in the state – including similar shares of both candidates’ supporters – said that party control of the Senate was very important to their vote.

CNN Projection: Republican Sen. Mike Lee will win reelection in Utah

Republican Sen. Mike Lee will win reelection in Utah, CNN projects, staving off a challenge by independent Evan McMullin. 
Lee’s win does little to shift the balance of power in the Senate -- Utah was seen as a reliable Republican win and Lee has held the seat since 2011. But McMullin, who said during the race that he would not caucus with either Democrats or Republicans if he were to win the seat, gave Lee a tougher-than-expected race by making it a referendum on former President Donald Trump’s dominance of the Republican Party and the Lee’s shift from a Trump critic to a Trump devotee. 
Utah Democrats opted not to put up their own nominee to challenge Lee, viewing McMullin as the best chance in decades for a non-Republican to win a Senate seat in the state. 
McMullin’s attacks focused on Lee’s tightness with Trump and his actions around the January 6, 2021, insurrection at the United States Capitol, most notably texts he sent to then-White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows. https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/25/politics/mark-meadows-texts-2319 
“We talk about 9/11, but I have to say, it shook me in the same way,” McMullin said during the campaign. “Different type of event. But just as dark, just as evil.” 
Lee pushed back against those attacks during a debate between the two candidates, claiming he was “one of the people trying to dismantle this situation, trying to stop it from happening.” 
Utah is home to one of the largest voting blocs of anti-Trump Republicans: In 2016, McMullin won over 21% of the vote in a longshot presidential bid; while in 2020, Trump only won 58% of the vote in the state, far lower than many recent Republican nominees. 
There was an awkwardness to the race, too. In 2016, Lee publicly said he voted for McMullin over Trump, something the independent candidate tried to use against Lee.

John Fetterman says he never expected to ""turn these red counties blue""

Democrat John Fetterman, who CNN projects will defeat Mehmet Oz in Pennsylvania's Senate race, said he is humbled to serve as the state's next senator.
“I'm so humbled, thank you so much,” he told his supporters.
He pointed to his campaign's slogan of ""every county, every vote."" Fetterman added, ""We jammed them up.""
“I’m proud of what we ran on — protecting a woman’s right to choose, raising the minimum wage, fighting the union way of life,"" he said. ""Healthcare is a fundamental human right. It saved my life and it should all be there for you if you should ever need it,"" he said, referring to the stroke he had earlier this year.
He thanked supporters and those who voted for him, saying, ""I never expected that we were going to turn these red counties blue. But we did what we needed to do.""
“We bet on the people of Pennsylvania and you didn’t let us down. And my promise to all of you is I will never let all of you down,"" Fetterman added.

CNN Projection: Democratic Gov. Tony Evers wins reelection in Wisconsin
From CNN’s Eric Bradner

Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers has won reelection, CNN projects, defeating Republican challenger Tim Michels and preserving Democrats’ veto power in a state where the GOP-led legislature is seeking veto-proof supermajorities.
Evers overcame weeks of attacks from Michels, a construction executive backed by former President Donald Trump, and other Republicans who portrayed him as soft on crime. 
He campaigned on his support for abortion rights in a state where an 1849 law banning abortions in almost all instances, including rape and incest, took effect after the Supreme Court reversed Roe v. Wade in June. Republicans in the legislature have so far declined to change that law. 
Evers’ victory could stymie Republican efforts to implement new restrictions on mail-in voting, defang the bipartisan Wisconsin Elections Commission and more ahead of a 2024 presidential race in which Wisconsin is set to once again play a crucial role.

Exit polls: Union households help propel Vance to victory in Ohio

Voters from union households in Ohio favored GOP Senate candidate J.D. Vance over his Democratic rival, Rep. Tim Ryan, which helped the Republican clinch the open seat, according to the early results of the Ohio exit poll conducted for CNN and other news networks by Edison Research.
Nearly 6 in 10 voters from union households cast ballots for Vance, who also garnered about the same level of support from men who voted and White voters. More than half of Buckeye State voters age 45 and older, voters without college degrees and those living in suburban and rural parts of the state opted for Vance, as well.
Ryan was the preferred candidate of just more than half of women who voted, independent voters, college-educated voters and younger voters. Roughly 6 in 10 voters who live in Ohio cities went for Ryan, as did more than three-quarters of voters of color in the state.
Voters who said they were most concerned about crime, inflation and immigration broke for Vance, while those who thought abortion and gun policy were top issues selected Ryan.
Vance was the choice of voters who wanted a candidate who shared their values, but Ryan was supported by those looking for a candidate who cares about people like them and a candidate who has honesty and integrity.

Democrats pick up key Senate seat in Pennsylvania — Here's where the balance of power stands
Democrats picked up a key Senate seat in Pennsylvania, with John Fetterman defeating Trump-backed GOP candidate Mehmet Oz.
Democrats now have secured 47 Senate seats to Republicans' 46, so far.
It's still too early to call who will control the chamber with seven seats yet to be projected including in Georgia and Arizona."

After Hillary lost, she went for a walk in the woods, wrote books, did podcasts & traveled the world advocating for human rights & democracy at large.
She didn’t once call for the Constitution to be terminated.

But do go on about how women are “too emotional to lead” won’t you.

 — 
As midterm results continue to roll in days after Election Day, Democratic and Republican candidates have already been celebrating historic victories.
Heading into Election Day, both parties were looking to diversify their ranks of elected officials, both in Congress and beyond, and they appear on track to do so.
House Republicans will add new members of color to their conference, including John James, who will be the first Black Republican congressman from Michigan, and Juan Ciscomani, who will be the first Latino Republican to represent Arizona in Congress.
Democrats will make a breakthrough for LGBTQ representation in governor’s offices. In Massachusetts and Oregon, Democrats Maura Healey and Tina Kotek will become the nation’s first out lesbian governors.
Republican Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the former Trump White House press secretary, will be the first female governor of Arkansas. And Maryland Democrat Wes Moore will be the state’s first Black governor.
There are still several races that have not yet been called. But for now, here’s a look at the candidates who CNN projects will make history in the 2022 midterms.
This list will be updated as more winners are projected.

After Hillary lost, she went for a walk in the woods, wrote books, did podcasts & traveled the world advocating for human rights & democracy at large.
She didn’t once call for the Constitution to be terminated.

But do go on about how women are “too emotional to lead” won’t you.

 — 
As midterm results continue to roll in days after Election Day, Democratic and Republican candidates have already been celebrating historic victories.
Heading into Election Day, both parties were looking to diversify their ranks of elected officials, both in Congress and beyond, and they appear on track to do so.
House Republicans will add new members of color to their conference, including John James, who will be the first Black Republican congressman from Michigan, and Juan Ciscomani, who will be the first Latino Republican to represent Arizona in Congress.
Democrats will make a breakthrough for LGBTQ representation in governor’s offices. In Massachusetts and Oregon, Democrats Maura Healey and Tina Kotek will become the nation’s first out lesbian governors.
Republican Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the former Trump White House press secretary, will be the first female governor of Arkansas. And Maryland Democrat Wes Moore will be the state’s first Black governor.
There are still several races that have not yet been called. But for now, here’s a look at the candidates who CNN projects will make history in the 2022 midterms.
This list will be updated as more winners are projected.

 — 
As midterm results continue to roll in days after Election Day, Democratic and Republican candidates have already been celebrating historic victories.
Heading into Election Day, both parties were looking to diversify their ranks of elected officials, both in Congress and beyond, and they appear on track to do so.
House Republicans will add new members of color to their conference, including John James, who will be the first Black Republican congressman from Michigan, and Juan Ciscomani, who will be the first Latino Republican to represent Arizona in Congress.
Democrats will make a breakthrough for LGBTQ representation in governor’s offices. In Massachusetts and Oregon, Democrats Maura Healey and Tina Kotek will become the nation’s first out lesbian governors.
Republican Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the former Trump White House press secretary, will be the first female governor of Arkansas. And Maryland Democrat Wes Moore will be the state’s first Black governor.
There are still several races that have not yet been called. But for now, here’s a look at the candidates who CNN projects will make history in the 2022 midterms.
This list will be updated as more winners are projected.
Alabama

AL-SEN: Republican Katie Britt will be the first elected female senator from Alabama, CNN projects, winning an open-seat race to succeed her onetime boss, retiring GOP Sen. Richard Shelby. Britt is a former CEO of the Business Council of Alabama and was the heavy favorite in the general election in the deep-red state. Two women have previously represented Alabama in the Senate, but both were appointed to fill vacancies.
Arizona
AZ-06: Juan Ciscomani will be the first Latino Republican elected to Congress from Arizona, CNN projects, winning election to the state’s 6th Congressional District. Ciscomani, who was born in Mexico and immigrated to the US with his family as a child, previously worked at the Tucson Hispanic Chamber of Commerce and was a senior adviser to Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey.
Arkansas

AR-GOV: Republican Sarah Huckabee Sanders will be the first woman elected governor of Arkansas, CNN projects, winning the office her father previously held for over a decade. Sanders, who earned a national profile in her role as press secretary in the Trump White House, is also the first daughter in US history to serve as governor of the same state her father once led.
AR-LG: Republican Leslie Rutledge will be the first woman elected lieutenant governor of Arkansas, CNN projects. Rutledge, the state attorney general, originally sought the open governor’s seat but switched to the lieutenant governor’s race after Sanders entered the GOP gubernatorial primary. Lieutenant governors are elected on separate tickets in Arkansas.
With the election of Sanders and Rutledge, Arkansas will join Massachusetts as the first states to have women serving concurrently as governor and lieutenant governor.
California
CA-SEN: Democrat Alex Padilla will be the first elected Latino senator from California, CNN projects, winning a special election for the remainder of Kamala Harris’ term as well as an election for a full six-year term. Padilla, the son of Mexican immigrant parents, was appointed by California Gov. Gavin Newsom to the seat Harris vacated when she became vice president.
CA-SOS: Democrat Shirley Weber will be California’s first elected Black secretary of state of state, CNN projects. Weber, a former state assemblywoman, has been serving in the position since last year after Newsom picked her to succeed Padilla, who was appointed to the US Senate.
CA-AG: Democrat Rob Bonta will be California’s first elected Filipino American attorney general, CNN projects. Bonta, who was born in the Philippines and immigrated with his family to the US as an infant, has been serving in the position since last year after Newsom appointed him to succeed Xavier Becerra, who left to become President Joe Biden’s Health and Human Services secretary.
CA-42: Democrat Robert Garcia will be the first out LGBTQ immigrant elected to Congress, CNN projects, winning election to California’s 42nd Congressional District. Garcia, who immigrated from Lima, Peru, in the early 1980s at the age of 5, is the current mayor of Long Beach.
Los Angeles Mayor: Democrat Karen Bass will be the first woman and the first Black woman elected mayor of Los Angeles, CNN projects. Bass, who currently represents a Los Angeles-area House seat, will defeat real estate developer Rick Caruso. Bass was on Joe Biden’s short list for a running mate in the 2020 campaign. She’s no stranger to making history: She previously served in the California State Assembly, where in 2008 she became the first Black woman to serve as speaker of a state legislature.
Bass said on November 17, the day after her race was called, that the accomplishment of becoming the first female mayor of Los Angeles and the magnitude of the job was “sinking in.”
“To me, when you do make history, when you’re in a position like this – and I was in a similar position when I was sworn in as speaker – it means that you have extra responsibility. You always have to make sure that you maintain excellence in every step of the way,” she said. “The path that you go is laying the foundation for those that come behind you.”
Colorado
CO-08: Democrat Yadira Caraveo will be the first Latina elected to Congress from Colorado, CNN projects, winning the race for the state’s new 8th Congressional District. Caraveo, a state representative and the daughter of Mexican immigrant parents, will defeat Republican state Sen. Barbara Kirkmeyer to win the seat located north of Denver.
Connecticut
CT-SOS: Democrat Stephanie Thomas will be the first Black woman elected secretary of state of Connecticut, CNN projects. Thomas, a member of the Connecticut House, will succeed appointed Democratic incumbent Mark Kohler.

FL-10: Democrat Maxwell Frost will be the first member of Generation Z elected to Congress, CNN projects, winning the open seat for Florida’s 10th Congressional District. Generation Z refers to those born after 1996. Frost will succeed Democrat Val Demings, who vacated the seat to run for Senate.
The 25-year-old representative-elect told CNN’s Poppy Harlow on November 9 that when President Joe Biden called to congratulate him, the President recalled being too young to be sworn in as a senator when he was first elected at age 29.
“He asked me if it was the same situation. I said, ‘No, Mr. President, you had me beat on that. I’m already old enough to be sworn in on January 3.’ So, it was great to talk with him. You know, he was elected at a very young age, too, so he understands that experience,” Frost said on “CNN This Morning.”
Frost, who made reducing gun violence a central part of his campaign, also told CNN that he will work to pass universal background checks in Washington.
Illinois
IL-03: Democrat Delia Ramirez will be the first Latina elected to Congress from Illinois, CNN projects, winning election to the state’s redrawn 3rd Congressional District. Ramirez, a Chicago-area state representative and the daughter of Guatemalan immigrants, was also the first Guatemalan American to serve in the Illinois General Assembly.
IL-17: Democrat Eric Sorensen will be the first out gay person elected to Congress from Illinois, CNN projects, winning election to the state’s 17th Congressional District. Sorensen, a former Rockford and Quad Cities meteorologist, will defeat Republican Esther Joy King in the race to succeed retiring Democratic Rep. Cheri Bustos.

MD-AG: Anthony Brown will be the first Black person elected attorney general of Maryland, CNN projects. Brown, who currently represents Maryland’s 5th Congressional District, has a been a longtime fixture in state politics, having also served as state lieutenant governor and in the state House and run for governor in 2014.
Massachusetts

MA-GOV: Democrat Maura Healey will be one of the first out lesbian governors in US history, CNN projects, winning an open-seat race for the governorship of Massachusetts. Healey, the current attorney general of Massachusetts, will also be the commonwealth’s first elected female governor. Also making history with Healey as one of the nation’s first out lesbian governors is Oregon Democrat Tina Kotek.
With the election of Healey and her running mate, Kim Driscoll, Massachusetts will join Arkansas as the first states to have women serving concurrently as governor and lieutenant governor.
MA-AG: Democrat Andrea Campbell will be the first Black woman elected attorney general of Massachusetts, CNN projects. Campbell, who ran for Boston mayor last year, was previously the first Black female president of the Boston City Council.
Michigan
MI-10: John James will be the first Black Republican elected to Congress from Michigan, CNN projects, winning election to the state’s 10th Congressional District.

MI-13: Democrat Shri Thanedar will be the first Indian American elected to Congress from Michigan, CNN projects, winning election to the state’s 13th Congressional District.

Nevada
NV-SOS: Democrat Cisco Aguilar will be the first Latino elected secretary of state of Nevada, CNN projects. Aguilar, who is Mexican American, will defeat Republican nominee Jim Marchant, a former state assemblyman who has repeatedly promoted false conspiracy theories about elections in Nevada.

NY-03: Republican George Santos will be the next congressman from New York’s 3rd Congressional District, CNN projects, winning the first House election between two out gay candidates.

After Hillary lost, she went for a walk in the woods, wrote books, did podcasts & traveled the world advocating for human rights & democracy at large.
She didn’t once call for the Constitution to be terminated.

But do go on about how women are “too emotional to lead” won’t you.

Updated 5:55 a.m. ET, November 9, 2022
What we covered here
Control of Senate and House still hang in the balance: It's too early to call key races — including in Nevada, Georgia, Wisconsin and Arizona — that could determine which party controls the chambers. Dozens of governorships, secretaries of states and attorneys general are also on the line.
First Senate flip of the night: Democrat John Fetterman will win Pennsylvania's Senate seat, CNN projects, and defeat Trump-backed Republican Mehmet Oz. The pick up is a big boost to Democrats' hopes of clinging to the Senate as the red wave that Republicans hoped for has yet to materialize in the House.
Historic firsts: Both parties are diversifying their ranks. Here's a look at the candidates CNN projects will make history.

CNN Projection: Democratic Gov. Tony Evers wins reelection in Wisconsin
From CNN’s Eric Bradner

Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers has won reelection, CNN projects, defeating Republican challenger Tim Michels and preserving Democrats’ veto power in a state where the GOP-led legislature is seeking veto-proof supermajorities.
Evers overcame weeks of attacks from Michels, a construction executive backed by former President Donald Trump, and other Republicans who portrayed him as soft on crime. 
He campaigned on his support for abortion rights in a state where an 1849 law banning abortions in almost all instances, including rape and incest, took effect after the Supreme Court reversed Roe v. Wade in June. Republicans in the legislature have so far declined to change that law. 
Evers’ victory could stymie Republican efforts to implement new restrictions on mail-in voting, defang the bipartisan Wisconsin Elections Commission and more ahead of a 2024 presidential race in which Wisconsin is set to once again play a crucial role.

Exit polls: Union households help propel Vance to victory in Ohio
From CNN's Tami Luhby

Voters from union households in Ohio favored GOP Senate candidate J.D. Vance over his Democratic rival, Rep. Tim Ryan, which helped the Republican clinch the open seat, according to the early results of the Ohio exit poll conducted for CNN and other news networks by Edison Research.
Nearly 6 in 10 voters from union households cast ballots for Vance, who also garnered about the same level of support from men who voted and White voters. More than half of Buckeye State voters age 45 and older, voters without college degrees and those living in suburban and rural parts of the state opted for Vance, as well.
Ryan was the preferred candidate of just more than half of women who voted, independent voters, college-educated voters and younger voters. Roughly 6 in 10 voters who live in Ohio cities went for Ryan, as did more than three-quarters of voters of color in the state.
Voters who said they were most concerned about crime, inflation and immigration broke for Vance, while those who thought abortion and gun policy were top issues selected Ryan.
Vance was the choice of voters who wanted a candidate who shared their values, but Ryan was supported by those looking for a candidate who cares about people like them and a candidate who has honesty and integrity.

Democrats pick up key Senate seat in Pennsylvania — Here's where the balance of power stands
Democrats picked up a key Senate seat in Pennsylvania, with John Fetterman defeating Trump-backed GOP candidate Mehmet Oz.
Democrats now have secured 47 Senate seats to Republicans' 46, so far.
It's still too early to call who will control the chamber with seven seats yet to be projected including in Georgia and Arizona.

Exit polls: Most voters don’t want Biden to run in 2024
From CNN's Tami Luhby

More than two-thirds of voters for House candidates don’t want President Joe Biden to run for reelection in 2024, according to the early results of the national exit poll conducted for CNN and other news networks by Edison Research.
More than 7 in 10 independent voters and roughly 9 in 10 Republican voters said they don’t want Biden to be in the 2024 presidential campaign. Fewer than 6 in 10 Democratic voters thought he should run.
Just under 6 in 10 independent voters have an unfavorable view of Biden, and about the same share disapprove of the job he’s doing as president.
Only 1 in 10 Democratic voters have an unfavorable view of the president and slightly more disapprove of his job performance.
More than 9 in 10 GOP voters have an unfavorable view of Biden and disapprove of the job he’s doing.
When it comes to former President Donald Trump, two-thirds of independent voters and more than 9 in 10 Democratic voters have an unfavorable view of him. Just over three-quarters of GOP voters have a favorable view.
Independent voters comprise about a quarter of the electorate, while Democratic voters are roughly one-third and Republican voters are just over one-third of the electorate.

CNN Projection: Democrat John Fetterman will defeat Mehmet Oz in Pennsylvania Senate race
From CNN’s Gregory Krieg
Fetterman speaks to supporters. (Pool)
Democrat John Fetterman will win the Pennsylvania Senate race, CNN projects, defeating Republican Mehmet Oz and helping Democrats pick up the seat following the retirement of GOP Sen. Pat Toomey.
Fetterman, the lieutenant governor since 2019, and Oz, who was endorsed by former President Donald Trump, ran one of the most contentious and expensive Senate contests in the country – all of it while Fetterman continued his recovery from a pre-primary stroke that often limited his ability to speak on the trail. 
For Democrats trying to preserve their control of what has been a Senate split 50-50, with Vice President Kamala Harris as the tie-breaking vote, Fetterman’s win could prove decisive. The commonwealth entered Election Day as one of at least nine states holding what were expected to be competitive Senate races. 
Fetterman’s victory caps a remarkable ascent from his time as mayor of small Braddock, a borough in western Pennsylvania, to the lieutenant governor’s office -- which he won after unseating a fellow Democrat in a 2018 primary -- and now, the US Senate. A longtime progressive, he is an outspoken supporter of abolishing the filibuster, raising the minimum wage, legalizing marijuana, criminal justice reform and passing legislation to protect same-sex marriage, among other leading liberal priorities. 
His success will also provide inspiration to stroke survivors and other disabled Americans, some of whom took heart from his efforts to carry on campaigning even as he exhibited the lingering effects of his May stroke. Fetterman, though he has not released his full medical records, has said he expects to be at or near full strength by the time he takes office early next year. 
Though Oz himself largely steered clear of disparaging Fetterman over his stroke-related difficulties, his campaign was less cautious, leading the Republican to repeatedly distance himself from his own staffers’ remarks. Asked at one point late in the campaign whether he would speak to his own patients the way his campaign addressed Fetterman, Oz responded with one word: “No.”

Michigan's Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer spoke moments ago as polls show her leading her race. She didn't declare victory, but Whitmer said ""we are feeling damn good about where we are heading.""
CNN is yet to make a projection in the race.
Whitmer thanked the crowd and said that Michigan voters' ""voices were heard"" and they ""set our state on the course that is focused on the future.""
""We have come a long way, Michigan,"" Whitmer said, adding that her campaign is ""thrilled at the unexpected high turnout.""
She invited those in attendance to ""come back in the morning.""
""We will be ready to talk about what the future of this state is for the next four years,"" Whitmer said.

Some 2020 election deniers will win secretary of state races, CNN projects
From CNN's Daniel Dale 
Some Republican candidates who have denied or refused to affirm the results of the 2020 election will be elected as state elections chief, CNN projects — though others will be defeated.
Here are three Republican secretary of state winners CNN has projected so far: 
Alabama: State Rep. Wes Allen, who endorsed the Texas-led legal effort to get the Supreme Court to overturn Joe Biden’s victory.
Indiana: Diego Morales, a former Mike Pence aide who wrote an article during the 2022 primary in which he falsely called the 2020 election a “scam” and wrongly said “the outcome is questionable.”
South Dakota: Monae Johnson, who repeatedly refused in an October 2022 interview to say that she accepted that Biden won the 2020 election legitimately.
In addition, Republican candidate Chuck Gray of Wyoming ran unopposed for secretary of state in the general election after winning the Republican primary. 
Here are five election deniers CNN projects will lose their 2022 races:
Massachusetts: Rayla Campbell, who falsely claimed Donald Trump was the real winner of a “stolen” 2020 election.
Minnesota: Kim Crockett, who baselessly said Minnesota’s 2020 election was “lawless” and that she agreed with an interviewer who called it “illegitimate.”
New Mexico: Audrey Trujillo, who also falsely claimed the 2020 election was “stolen” from Trump. 
Vermont: H. Brooke Paige, another candidate who falsely claimed the left “stole” the election.
Michigan: Kristina Karamo, who also falsely claimed in a social media video in December 2020 “Donald Trump won Michigan.”
CNN found that at least 12 Republican candidates for secretary of state have questioned, rejected or tried to overturn the results of the 2020 election. CNN had not yet projected the other races as of midnight ET on Wednesday morning.

It’s 1 a.m. ET, and polls are closing in Alaska. Here’s what to know about the state’s races. 
From CNN’s Ethan Cohen and Melissa Holzberg DePalo 
US Sen. Lisa Murkowski, left, and Kelly Tshibaka (Getty Images)
It’s 1 a.m. ET, and polls are now closing across Alaska. 
These are the key races in the state: GOP Sen. Lisa Murkowski has survived tough elections before – she won her 2010 Senate race as a write-in candidate – but now she is facing Trump-endorsed opponent Kelly Tshibaka in Alaska’s first ranked-choice Senate election. 
The independent-minded Murkowski has frequently been a target of Trump and his supporters, especially since she voted to convict in Trump’s second impeachment. Murkowski won 45% in the top-four primary while Tshibaka, the former commissioner of the Alaska Department of Administration got 39%. 
If no candidate wins a majority of first choice votes, the election will be decided by ranked choice voting and the second choices of supporters of Democrat Patricia Chesbro could be key. 
In the House race, Rep. Mary Peltola won a special election in August to replace long-time Republican Don Young, who died in March, and she’s hoping to repeat the feat. 
Peltola will face the same two Republicans in Alaska’s ranked-choice system. Sarah Palin, former Alaska governor and 2008 vice presidential nominee, is backed by Trump and finished second to Peltola in August. 
Nick Begich, who has a name well known in Alaska politics, argues that he can beat Peltola in the ranked-choice tabulation, after many of his voters spurned Palin on their special election ballots. Peltola led the top-four primary with nearly 37% of the vote."

CNN Projection: Georgia’s Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger will win reelection 
From CNN staff

Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, who refused former President Donald Trump's request to ""find"" the votes needed to overturn his 2020 loss in the Peach State, will win reelection, CNN projects. 
Raffensperger's rebuff – and role as a witness before the House select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol – has made him one of the country’s best-known election chiefs. 
""I've had to stand up to incredible pressure,"" the Republican said, during a recent candidate debate. ""Many people buckled and folded. I didn't, and I won't."" 
He defeated the Democratic nominee, state Rep. Bee Nguyen, a rising political star in her party. She had put expanding access to the ballot at the center of her candidacy and sought to make history by becoming the first Asian-American elected to a statewide political office in Georgia. 
The two have clashed over Raffensperger’s support of SB202, an elections bill approved by the Georgia General Assembly last year that imposed a range of new voting restrictions, including adding new identification requirements to vote by mail and making it a crime for third parties to give food or water to voters waiting in line.

Peltola will face the same two Republicans in Alaska’s ranked-choice system. Sarah Palin, former Alaska governor and 2008 vice presidential nominee, is backed by Trump and finished second to Peltola in August. 
Nick Begich, who has a name well known in Alaska politics, argues that he can beat Peltola in the ranked-choice tabulation, after many of his voters spurned Palin on their special election ballots. Peltola led the top-four primary with nearly 37% of the vote.

CNN Projection: Georgia’s Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger will win reelection 
From CNN staff

Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, who refused former President Donald Trump's request to ""find"" the votes needed to overturn his 2020 loss in the Peach State, will win reelection, CNN projects. 
Raffensperger's rebuff – and role as a witness before the House select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol – has made him one of the country’s best-known election chiefs. 
""I've had to stand up to incredible pressure,"" the Republican said, during a recent candidate debate. ""Many people buckled and folded. I didn't, and I won't."" 
He defeated the Democratic nominee, state Rep. Bee Nguyen, a rising political star in her party. She had put expanding access to the ballot at the center of her candidacy and sought to make history by becoming the first Asian-American elected to a statewide political office in Georgia. 
The two have clashed over Raffensperger’s support of SB202, an elections bill approved by the Georgia General Assembly last year that imposed a range of new voting restrictions, including adding new identification requirements to vote by mail and making it a crime for third parties to give food or water to voters waiting in line.

Democratic Rep. Vicente Gonzalez will defeat Republican Rep. Mayra Flores in a rare member-against-member House race in the Texas 34th District, CNN projects.
His win offers evidence that Democrats have had some success stemming their losses among Latino voters in the Rio Grande Valley, who shifted in the GOP’s favor in 2020.

CNN Projection: Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham wins reelection bid in New Mexico
From CNN’s Dan Merica

New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham will win reelection in New Mexico, CNN projects, overcoming a stronger-than-expected challenge from Republican Mark Ronchetti.
Lujan Grisham’s win makes her the fourth straight New Mexico governor to win reelection and will likely grow her national profile -- the Democrat received some vice-presidential consideration by President Joe Biden ahead of the 2020 presidential general election. 
Lujan Grisham centered her campaign on abortion, casting her opponent as extreme on the issue that motivated Democratic campaigns across the country. She also nationalized the race -- both Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris visited the state in the final weeks of the campaign. 
The reason for that: The last four Democratic presidential nominees carried the state, including Biden by 11 percentage points two years ago. 
Ronchetti, a former TV weatherman, tried to turn Lujan Grisham into an avatar for Democratic control in Washington and attacked her as a career politician. 
“We can be a state that looks out for you before it looks out for government, but you have to give us a chance at change,” he said at the final debate between the two candidates. 
But Lujan Grisham successfully convinced voters that Ronchetti was not the person to be the change. 
“Bad for New Mexicans, bad for New Mexico,” she said of Ronchetti during the debate.

CNN Projection: Democratic Rep. Henry Cuellar will win reelection in South Texas House race

Rep. Henry Cuellar, the lone House Democrat who has voted against abortion rights, will win reelection in Texas’ 28th Congressional District, CNN projects. 
Cuellar will defeat Republican challenger Cassy Garcia, halting the GOP’s efforts to sweep a trio of Rio Grande Valley districts as the party makes gains among Latino voters.

2022 midterm election results

Updated 5:55 a.m. ET, November 9, 2022
What we covered here
Control of Senate and House still hang in the balance: It's too early to call key races — including in Nevada, Georgia, Wisconsin and Arizona — that could determine which party controls the chambers. Dozens of governorships, secretaries of states and attorneys general are also on the line.
First Senate flip of the night: Democrat John Fetterman will win Pennsylvania's Senate seat, CNN projects, and defeat Trump-backed Republican Mehmet Oz. The pick up is a big boost to Democrats' hopes of clinging to the Senate as the red wave that Republicans hoped for has yet to materialize in the House.
Historic firsts: Both parties are diversifying their ranks. Here's a look at the candidates CNN projects will make history.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has won reelection, CNN projects, defeating her GOP opponent in the midterm race.
Pelosi, a towering figure in Democratic politics, won out against longshot Republican challenger John Dennis in the race for California’s 11th Congressional District.
Over the years, Pelosi, 82, has become one of the most prominent faces of the Democratic Party. As speaker, she has earned a reputation as a powerful and formidable leader to House Democrats who exerts significant influence and a tight grip over members of her caucus. 
Pelosi has also been a fierce adversary to Republicans and has become a highly polarizing figure in Washington as a result. 
Speculation over Pelosi’s future atop the House Democratic caucus has intensified as the midterms approached and Republicans fought to regain the House majority. 
CNN reported in September that in interviews with more than two dozen House Democrats, a consensus began to emerge: If they lose the majority, there would be overwhelming pressure for Pelosi to go, a prospect that Democratic sources said the powerful House speaker is keenly aware of. 
At the same time, multiple members said they were also starting to see how, if Democrats do hold control, it could lead to Pelosi extending her time in power. Yet Democrats are split about that possibility, with a sizable contingent eager for new leadership regardless of the outcome, even if she’d be the heavy favorite to hold onto the gavel.

It's midnight on the East Coast. Here's what you need to know
From CNN Staff
It's midnight on the East Coast and we are down to eight Senate seats still to be decided — and it is dead even between Democrats and Republicans. The race to control the Senate currently stands at — 46 seats for Democrats, 46 for Republicans.
Here are more of the latest Election night headlines:
Trump-backed Republican J.D. Vance will win Ohio Senate race: Republican J.D. Vance will win the Ohio Senate race, CNN projects, outlasting a stronger-than-expected challenge from Democrat Tim Ryan and keeping the seat under GOP control. Vance’s win is a boon for Republicans and a victory for former President Donald Trump, whose endorsement in the Republican primary helped Vance emerge from the contentious intraparty fight. 
Democrat Josh Shapiro will win Pennsylvania governorship: Democratic state Attorney General Josh Shapiro will be the next governor of Pennsylvania, CNN projects, defeating far-right Republican state lawmaker Doug Mastriano. Shapiro’s ascent means Democrats will keep control of the state’s top job, providing a powerful check on its GOP-held state legislature, as Gov. Tom Wolf leaves office due to term limits. Shapiro is also now poised to become a leading national Democratic figure short-listed for the party’s next open presidential primary. 
Incumbent GOP Gov. Brian Kemp will defeat Stacey Abrams in Georgia governor race: Republican Gov. Brian Kemp will be reelected in Georgia, CNN projects, defeating Democrat Stacey Abrams for a second time. Abrams has called Kemp to concede, according to a Kemp campaign source. Kemp had been seen as the favorite in the race for months, with Abrams unable to capture the momentum she experienced in 2018 and hampered by broader voter discontent with Democratic control of Washington. 
New Hampshire Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan will win reelection bid: Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan will win her bid for reelection, CNN projects, defeating Republican Don Bolduc and delivering her party a key win in its bid to keep the Senate in Democratic control. Hassan was widely seen as one of the most vulnerable Senate Democrats in the country at the start of the year, saddled with lagging economic indicators and President Joe Biden’s sluggish approval rating. 
Wes Moore makes history in Maryland: CNN projects that Wes Moore will become the first Black governor in Maryland’s history, defeating Republican state Delegate Dan Cox. Moore will be just the third Black American to be elected governor of a US state. Virginia’s Douglas Wilder was the first in 1989, and Massachusetts’ Deval Patrick was the second in 2006.
Here's what the House and Senate look like at 11:30 p.m. ET, according to CNN's projections:

It’s midnight ET. Polls are closing in Hawaii 
From CNN’s Ethan Cohen and Melissa Holzberg DePalo 
It’s midnight ET, and the polls are closing in Hawaii. 
Democratic Sen. Brian Schatz is running for his second full term — he was appointed to the Senate in 2012 and won a special election in 2014 before winning a full term in 2016. Hawaii is one of the bluest states in the country, giving Schatz a huge boost in his bid against GOP state Rep. Bob McDermott. 
Hawaii has only elected two Republican governors in its history (Linda Lingle and William Francis Quinn), and it’s unlikely that will change this year. Hawaii voters will choose between Democratic Lt. Gov. Josh Green and Republican former Lt. Gov. Duke Aiona. 
Green became a household name to Hawaii voters during the Covid-19 pandemic. In addition to being a doctor who worked as a physician during his time in the state legislature and as lieutenant governor, Green served as the administration's health liaison between the state and the health care community during the pandemic.

CNN Projection: Becca Balint will make history as the first woman to represent Vermont in Congress 
From CNN’s Kaanita Iyer��

Democrat Becca Balint will make history as the first woman elected to Congress from Vermont, with CNN projecting she will defeat GOP nominee Liam Madden for the state’s at-large House seat. 
Vermont had been the last remaining state in the country not to have elected a woman to Congress. 
With her win, Balint will also become the first out LGBTQ person elected to Congress from the Green Mountain State. She previously made history in the Vermont Senate, where she was the first woman to serve as president pro tempore. 
The state’s lone House seat opened up after Welch, who was first elected to the House in 2007, announced a bid late last year for the seat being vacated by Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy. The retiring senator was first elected in 1974 and is the longest-serving senator still in office and the third-longest-serving senator in Senate history."

After Hillary lost, she went for a walk in the woods, wrote books, did podcasts & traveled the world advocating for human rights & democracy at large.
She didn’t once call for the Constitution to be terminated.

 — 
The battle for control of Congress is still up in the air, with the Senate coming down to three key races while Democrats and Republicans are still hanging onto hopes of winning a narrow majority in the House.
Republicans began Tuesday night with a rout in Florida, where Gov. Ron DeSantis won heavily Latino, historically Democratic regions on his way to a blowout victory that could serve as a launch pad for a 2024 presidential run.
But in the hours that have followed, Democrats reclaimed ground. In Pennsylvania, Democratic Lt. Gov. John Fetterman defeated Republican Mehmet Oz for the seat of retiring Republican Sen. Pat Toomey.
As of Thursday morning, the battle for the House majority – one that favored Republicans, who expected to benefit from high inflation, historical trends and friendly new district lines after 2021’s redistricting – remains unsettled.

CNN analyst: Here's what DeSantis' projected victory could mean for the GOP
02:18 - Source: CNN
Here are takeaways as votes are still being counted in key races:
Questions over control remain
Election Day is over but the fundamental questions of this election cycle remain unanswered.
To start, control of the Senate remains up for grabs. Fetterman’s victory in Pennsylvania, flipping a GOP seat, gave Democrats some breathing room as they await results from Arizona, Nevada and Georgia. Republicans now need to win two of those three to claim a majority, but the Georgia Senate race will go to a runoff in December after no candidate won more than 50% of the vote.
The shape of the House, too, remains uncertain. Republicans appear poised to take control but there are scant signs of the big night they were hoping for. As the votes continue to be counted, the coming days will likely reveal the strength of a new GOP House majority – and whether a potentially underwhelming performance undermines Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy’s standing within a rancorous GOP conference. The GOP is now in a race-by-race fight that will ultimately determine McCarthy’s ability to govern.
Key states are still counting ballots
Votes are still being counted in several key states – including Arizona and Nevada, where a sweep of the Senate races by either party would result in control of the chamber.
Arizona and Nevada also have competitive races for governor, secretary of state and more to be decided in the coming days.
What to know as states keep counting with key races hanging in the balance
In Arizona, as of late Wednesday night, about 600,000 votes remained to be counted – the bulk of them in Maricopa County, the home of Phoenix and the state’s most populous. Those votes could decide the Senate race between Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly and Republican nominee Blake Masters, as well as the gubernatorial contest between Democratic Secretary of State Katie Hobbs and Republican former television journalist Kari Lake, an election denier.
In Nevada, CNN estimates that as of Wednesday night, about 160,000 known ballots remain to be counted. Mail-in ballots can be accepted through Saturday so more could be en route to elections offices. The state is the home of a crucial Senate contest between Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto and Republican challenger Adam Laxalt.
The final House landscape also depends on races that have not yet been decided as a handful of states, including California, Oregon, Nevada and Arizona, continue to count ballots.
In Alaska, a Republican will win the Senate race – but it’s not clear whether Sen. Lisa Murkowski or her Donald Trump-backed challenger Kelly Tshibaka will cross the 50% threshold to avoid the race being decided by ranked choice voting. Democratic Rep. Mary Peltola leads the House race there, but it’s also not clear whether that race’s outcome will be decided by ranked choice voting.
Democrats go a long way to protecting their Senate majority
Republicans were not shy about the importance of Pennsylvania’s Senate race: “This is a must-win race. We believe if we win Pennsylvania, we win the majority,” said Steven Law, president of the preeminent Republican Senate super PAC.
Early on Wednesday morning, CNN projected that Fetterman would be the next senator from Pennsylvania, defeating Oz in the most expensive and high stakes Senate campaign in the country.
Democratic pick up in Pennsylvania boosts their hopes of holding Senate
Fetterman’s win was a thunderclap for Democrats. While the race long represented the best chance for the party to pick up a Senate seat in 2022, Fetterman’s near fatal stroke in May – and the lengthy recovery he endured in public – injected uncertainty into the race. But on Wednesday morning, the Pennsylvania lieutenant governor gave Democrats the pick-up they needed to have a better chance to hold the United States Senate next year.
“Fetterman’s win makes it next to impossible for the GOP to get a majority. Pennsylvania was the fire wall,” said Mike Mikus, a Democratic operative based in Western Pennsylvania.
Although a number of key Senate races remain uncalled – including contests in Nevada and Arizona and in Georgia which will go to a runoff – earlier on Tuesday, CNN projected one Democratic incumbent: Sen. Maggie Hassan, a first-term Democrat who faced Republican retired Army Brig. Gen. Don Bolduc, won her race.
A Hassan loss would have effectively ended Democrats’ hopes of retaining their majority. And CNN projected Wednesday that Republican Ron Johnson will keep his Senate seat in Wisconsin. The Democrats are still defending seats in Arizona, Georgia and Nevada – so it will take time to settle Senate control.

Trump’s no good, very bad night
Few Republicans were more involved in these midterms than Trump and the former president had a particularly bad night.
It appears that Trump knows it, too: He is “livid” and “screaming at everyone,” a Trump adviser who has been in contact with Trump’s inner circle told CNN on Wednesday morning.
The most striking loss for Trump came in Pennsylvania, where his chosen candidate, Oz, fell to Fetterman in what was the most expensive Senate race in the country. Trump endorsed Oz during the contentious Republican primary, effectively pulling through a brutal primary and narrowly into the general election. But where the former president’s backing was decisive in the primary, it was an albatross in the general election for a Republican Senate candidate who was attempting to make inroads in the suburbs by touting his own moderation.
Trump grapples with 2024 questions amid GOP midterm letdown
While Trump did score some Senate wins – Trump-backed Republican JD Vance defeated a stronger-than-expected challenge from Democrat Tim Ryan in the Ohio Senate race, while Republican Ted Budd defeated Democrat Cheri Beasley in North Carolina – those wins have so far been limited to Republican states.
In the House, too, some Trump acolytes lost in what were seen as competitive contests that Republicans needed to win if they were going to build a significant majority in the legislative body.
In New Hampshire, former Trump aide Karoline Leavitt lost to Democratic Rep. Chris Pappas in what was seen as a highly competitive contest. In North Carolina, Trump-backed Republican Bo Hines lost to Democrat Wiley Nickel in a race that was widely seen as a test of the former president’s influence. And in Ohio, Democratic state Rep. Emilia Sykes defeated Republican Madison Gesiotto Gilbert who bullishly touted her ties to Trump.
Trump’s evening was particularly bad when viewed through the lens of DeSantis’ romp of a night.
DeSantis, Trump’s clearest rival for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, overwhelmingly won reelection on Tuesday, crushing Democrat Charlie Crist by nearly 20 percentage points, continuing to consolidate Latino support in Florida and even by winning populous counties like Miami-Dade.
The headline in Trump’s one-time hometown paper, the New York Post, said it all: “DeFUTURE,” the headline blared, showing the Florida Republican on stage with his family.
Democrats hold their own in the suburbs
In 2018, the suburbs delivered Democrats the House majority. In 2020, they vaulted Joe Biden to the presidency.
And in 2022, suburbs across the country went a long way to helping Democrats avoid a significant red wave.
Republicans may still win the House, but if the 2022 election was going to be a red wave, it was likely to come through suburban victories that have not materialized yet.
2022 midterm election results
In a district made up of the Kansas City suburbs, CNN projected Democrat Sharice Davids would win reelection. In Ohio, CNN projected two suburban wins: Democrat Greg Landsman defeated Republican Rep. Steve Chabot in a district that included Cincinnati and some of the surrounding suburbs and Democratic state Rep. Emilia Sykes defeated Republican Madison Gesiotto Gilbert in a district that includes areas around Cleveland and all of Akron. In Illinois, CNN projected that Democratic incumbent Lauren Underwood would win reelection against Republican Scott Gryder in the Chicago suburbs. And in Virginia, CNN projected Democratic Rep. Abigail Spanberger would win reelection, largely because of the votes she picked up from the suburbs of Washington, DC.
Republicans did score some suburban victories – CNN projected Brandon Ogles the winner in a district around Nashville, Tom Kean Jr. winning in a suburban New Jersey district and Rich McCormick the victor in a district that included Atlanta’s northern suburbs – but it was their defeats that spoke volumes about the size of the GOP wave.
Another January 6 committee member loses
Democratic Rep. Elaine Luria, a member of the House select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol, lost her Virginia Beach-based House seat, CNN projected.
Luria’s loss to Kiggans, Republican Navy veteran, was the latest demonstration that the lasting focus on the insurrection – even as it sheds light on a dark chapter in the nation’s capitol – is a political anchor for those involved.
Luria had defeated former GOP Rep. Scott Taylor in 2018 and 2020. But the district had become slightly more favorable ground for Republicans in redistricting: Biden carried the previous version by 5 points, and would have lost the new district by 2 points.
And Luria provided the latest evidence that voters are not rewarding those involved in the committee probing the insurrection. Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney was routed in a primary by Trump-backed challenger Harriet Hageman, while Republican Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois and Rep. Stephanie Murphy, a Florida Democrat, both retired rather than seeking reelection.
DeSantis’ big win could be a 2024 launchpad
DeSantis led a dominant Republican ticket in Florida – delivering historic margins in Democratic territory in his victory Crist on a night that provides him a powerful argument if he seeks the GOP’s 2024 presidential nomination.
The easy wins by DeSantis, who led by nearly 20 percentage points with 92% of the estimated vote counted, and Sen. Marco Rubio, who was 17 points up, were enough to cast doubt on Florida’s status as a national bellwether.
The most eye-popping outcome – and one that demonstrates the breadth of DeSantis’ appeal in the eyes of Sunshine State voters – came in Miami-Dade County, which is heavily Hispanic and historically a huge source of Democratic votes.
Ron DeSantis will win reelection as Florida governor, CNN projects
Republicans had made gains there in recent years: Hillary Clinton defeated former President Trump there by 29 percentage points in 2016. DeSantis did slightly better in the 2018 governor’s race, losing the county by 21 points. Trump made inroads there in 2020, losing by just 8 points. But a GOP candidate for governor hadn’t actually won Miami-Dade County since Jeb Bush in 2002.
The political reality is straightforward: Democrats have no realistic path to victory in statewide races in Florida without big wins in Miami-Dade County. That reality makes county’s outcome into an exclamation point on a dominant GOP performance.
DeSantis’ win comes as a battle over the future of the Republican Party takes shape, with Trump signaling a potential 2024 announcement next week. Exit polls in Florida showed that 45% of the state’s voters would like to see DeSantis run for president, compared to 33% who want Trump to run in 2024.
In a victory speech Tuesday night, DeSantis offered a glimpse at how he might describe his governorship to a national audience. Touting his refusal to impose lockdowns during the Covid-19 pandemic, he said that Florida “was a refuge of sanity when the world went mad.” He also described the state as “where woke goes to die” and “a ray of hope that better days still lie ahead.”
GOP makes gains with Latinos in Florida
Republicans hoped to build on Trump’s inroads among Latino voters in 2020, a trend that could reshape the political landscapes in several swing states if it continues.
The strongest early signal that the GOP had continued to make gains came in Miami-Dade County, home to a large Cuban population.
Exit polls: High inflation dominates voters' views in the midterm elections
But Latinos are not a monolith, and there were more important signs in Florida, too: Another traditional Democratic stronghold won by DeSantis was Osceola County, a majority Latino county south of Orlando with a heavily Puerto Rican population.
However, it’s not clear if those GOP gains are materializing outside Florida.
One key gauge was the Rio Grande Valley in Texas, where three House races in heavily Latino districts were up for grabs. Democrats have won two of those races, CNN projected. Rep. Henry Cuellar, the only House Democrat who votes against abortion rights, won reelection in his Laredo-based 28th District, while Democratic Rep. Vicente Gonzalez defeated Republican Rep. Mayra Flores – the two were drawn into the same district – in the McAllen-based 34th District. The 15th District race, which was widely seen as the GOP’s best chance, is still too early to call.
“The RED WAVE did not happen. Republicans and Independents stayed home,” Flores tweeted just after midnight.
Arizona and Nevada, both competitive states with significant Latino populations, are also important to watch. So are a spate of House races in California, where it could take days or weeks for winners to become clear.
Democrats had a good night in governor’s races
CNN projected Wes Moore the winner in Maryland and Maura Healey the victor in Massachusetts, two seats that are currently in Republican control. Democratic governors in Minnesota, Michigan, Wisconsin, New Mexico and others are projected to hold their seats, while Democrat Josh Shapiro defeated Republican Doug Mastriano in a seat where Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf was term limited.
But as Tuesday turned into Wednesday, Democrats have a shot at strengthening their grip of governor’s offices across the country.
Female governors will break a record in 2023
CNN projected Kansas Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly the winner in her bid for reelection on Wednesday morning, while Democrats are competitive in Oregon and Nevada, two states that would represent Democratic holds, and Arizona, a state that would represent a Democratic flip.
The night is far from an unmitigated victory for Democrats – and how the three outstanding key races tip could shift the way Democrats see their gubernatorial successes. And some of the most famous Democratic gubernatorial candidates did lose: CNN projected Georgia Democrat Stacey Abrams failed to unseat Republican incumbent Gov. Brian Kemp in a rematch of their 2018 race, and Texas Democrat Beto O’Rourke was unable to defeat Republican incumbent Gov. Greg Abbott.
But few Democratic operatives would have said weeks ago that they would be in line to have this kind of night in governors races.
Abortion rights, and its defenders, triumph
In referendums and races where the Supreme Court’s June decision to reverse Roe v. Wade was a central issue, voters sided overwhelmingly with Democrats and in favor of abortion rights.
In Michigan, Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer – who staked her reelection campaign on her successful efforts to block the enforcement of the state’s 1931 law banning abortion in almost all instances – defeated Republican challenger Tudor Dixon, who had waged a campaign focused on cultural battles.
Abortion rights were on the ballot in these states. Here's what voters decided
Michigan voters also approved a Whitmer-backed amendment to the state’s constitution that will scrap that 1931 law and guarantee abortion rights.
Voters in California and Vermont also green-lit constitutional amendments enshrining abortion rights.
In Wisconsin, Democratic Gov. Tony Evers had made abortion a central focus of his campaign. Republicans there have rejected Evers’ efforts to amend the state’s 1849 abortion ban to include exceptions for rape and incest. He highlighted that split by calling the GOP-led legislature into a special session in October and urging them to act on the issue – and then used lawmakers’ decision to adjourn in less than 30 seconds without taking action as a campaign cudgel.
It’ll take time to sort out which issues were decisive, particularly in suburban House battles. But according to CNN exit polls, 27% of voters in House races said abortion was the most important issue – second only to inflation at 31%. Among those who cited abortion as the most important issue, 76% voted Democratic.
A night of firsts
Up and down the ballot, in red states and blue, candidates from both parties are celebrating pathbreaking victories.
In Massachusetts, Healey is poised to become the state’s first elected female governor and the nation’s first out lesbian state executive. Republican Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the former Trump White House press secretary, has been elected the first female governor of Arkansas. And Moore will be the Maryland’s first Black governor.

Florida has also elected the youngest-ever House member, 25-year-old Maxwell Alejandro Frost, now on track to become the first Gen Z candidate to hold federal office.
Virginia’s split decision offers early signals
Three Democratic-controlled House races in Virginia were widely viewed as an early warning signal of the night’s results. With all House districts in the commonwealth projected by CNN, the results hint at a night where Democrats could lose the House – but would not face a 2014-style wave.
Democrats held seats in two Virginia districts Biden won in 2020.
CNN projected that Democratic Jennifer Wexton won her reelection bid in Virginia’s 10th District. Republicans were hoping Wexton could fall on Tuesday if the night was particularly bad for Democrats.
In an even more competitive race, CNN projected Spanberger also won reelection in Virginia’s 7th District. Spanberger was widely seen as a vulnerable incumbent, especially after Republican Glenn Youngkin carried the district in his successful gubernatorial campaign in 2021.
But Democrats lost in southeastern Virginia, with CNN projecting that Republican state Sen. Jen Kiggans defeated Luria.
“I was in the White House in 2010 when the big wave rolled in. I know what it feels like. It doesn’t feel like this,” said David Axelrod, the top political adviser to former President Barack Obama.
Scott Jennings, a Republican operative and CNN contributor, said whether the results are a wave or just a slight shift in the House, the impact will be the same on President Joe Biden’s administration.
“Whether it is a wave, a ripple, or whatever you want to call it, the oversight is going to feel all the same,” Jennings said.
This story has been updated with additional developments.

What we covered here
Control of Senate and House still hang in the balance: It's too early to call key races — including in Nevada, Georgia, Wisconsin and Arizona — that could determine which party controls the chambers. Dozens of governorships, secretaries of states and attorneys general are also on the line.
First Senate flip of the night: Democrat John Fetterman will win Pennsylvania's Senate seat, CNN projects, and defeat Trump-backed Republican Mehmet Oz. The pick up is a big boost to Democrats' hopes of clinging to the Senate as the red wave that Republicans hoped for has yet to materialize in the House.
Historic firsts: Both parties are diversifying their ranks. Here's a look at the candidates CNN projects will make history.

From recreational marijuana to voting initiatives, here are the latest decisions on key ballot measures

Voters around the country weighed in on key ballot measures on Tuesday, including initiatives that require IDs to vote and others that would legalize recreational marijuana.
Here's what we know so far:
Marijuana
Arkansas voters reject recreational marijuana ballot initiative: Arkansas voters on Tuesday rejected a constitutional amendment that would have allowed cannabis possession and recreational consumption by adults as well as the sale by licensed facilities, CNN projects. Had it passed, cannabis possession of up to an ounce would have been legal and some tax revenue from marijuana sales would have contributed to funding law enforcement.
Maryland legalizes recreational marijuana with ballot measure: Maryland voters on Tuesday approved a constitutional amendment that legalizes recreational marijuana for people 21 and older. It will go into effect on July 1, 2023, and allow possession of 1.5 ounces or two plants. Possession of small amounts of marijuana was already decriminalized in Maryland. Under the amendment, those previously convicted of cannabis possession and intent to distribute will be able to apply for record expungement. 
Voters end prohibitions on marijuana in Missouri: Missouri voters on Tuesday approved a constitutional amendment that ends prohibitions on marijuana in the state and allows personal use for those or those over the age of 21, CNN projects. It will allow personal possession up to 3 ounces. Additionally, the amendment allows individuals with marijuana-related non-violent offenses to petition for release from prison or parole and probation and have their records expunged. The amendment, which will be enacted 30 days after the election, prohibits marijuana facilities from selling cannabis-infused products shaped or packaged as candy that may be attractive to children. 
North Dakota voters reject ballot measure to legalize recreational marijuana: A citizen-initiated ballot measure that aimed to allow the use of marijuana in ""various forms"" for those who are at least 21 years-old was rejected by North Dakota voters, CNN projects. It would have allowed marijuana possession of up to an ounce and all marijuana is to be tested in a facility ""for the potency of products and the presence of pesticides"" and subject to random inspection. Legalization was on the ballot in four other states this November. 
South Dakota voters reject proposal to legalize recreational marijuana: Voters in South Dakota rejected a ballot measure that aimed to legalize marijuana for recreational use in the state, CNN projects. Marijuana legalization previously passed in 2020, but South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem’s office championed efforts to nullify the legalization saying that it violated the state’s constitution. The Republican governor’s office previously indicated to CNN that the 2022 measure appears to be written constitutionally and she would have implemented it if it passed. 
Voting
Nebraska voters approve measure to require ID to cast ballot: Nebraska voters have approved an initiative that would amend the state constitution to require that voters present a valid photo identification in a way that is specified by the legislature, CNN projects. To pass, “yes” needed to win a majority and votes equal to at least 35% of total votes cast in the election. 
Connecticut passes ballot measure to allow early voting: Connecticut voters have approved a measure that would amend the state constitution to permit the legislature to enact early voting, CNN projects.

Here are some key takeaways from Election Night — and where things stand now 
From CNN's Eric Bradner, Dan Merica and Gregory Krieg
The battle for control of Congress – both the House and the Senate – is coming down to a dwindling number of key races, with Democrats dashing Republicans’ hopes for a red wave and both parties hanging onto hopes of winning narrow majorities.
Republicans began the night with a rout in Florida, where Gov. Ron DeSantis won heavily Latino, historically Democratic regions on his way to a blowout victory that could serve as a launch pad for a 2024 presidential run.
But in the hours that have followed, Democrats have fought back. In Pennsylvania, Democratic Lt. Gov. John Fetterman defeated Republican Mehmet Oz for the seat of retiring Republican Sen. Pat Toomey.
Meanwhile, the battle for the House majority – one that favored Republicans, who expected to benefit from high inflation, historical trends and friendly new district lines after 2021’s redistricting – remains unsettled.
Here are some key takeaways as votes continue to be counted in key races:
Democrats go a long way to protecting their Senate majority: Republicans were not shy about the importance of Pennsylvania’s Senate race: “This is a must-win race. We believe if we win Pennsylvania, we win the majority,” said Steven Law, president of the preeminent Republican Senate super PAC. Early on Wednesday morning, CNN projected that Fetterman would be the next senator from Pennsylvania, defeating Oz in the most expensive and high stakes Senate campaign in the country. Fetterman’s win was a thunderclap for Democrats.
Democrats and the suburbs: Suburban areas across the country went a long way to helping Democrats avoid a significant red wave. Republicans may still win the House, but if the 2022 election was going to be a red wave, it was likely to come through suburban victories that have not materialized yet. Republicans did score some suburban victories – CNN projected Brandon Ogles the winner in a district around Nashville, Tom Kean Jr. winning in a suburban New Jersey district and Rich McCormick the victor in a district that included Atlanta’s northern suburbs – but it was their defeats that spoke volumes about the size of the GOP wave.
Virginia’s split decision offers early signals: Three Democratic-controlled House races in Virginia were widely viewed as an early warning signal of the night’s results. Democrats held seats in two Virginia districts Biden won in 2020. CNN projected that Democratic Jennifer Wexton won her reelection bid in Virginia’s 10th District. In an even more competitive race, CNN projected Rep. Abigail Spanberger also won reelection in Virginia’s 7th District. But Democrats lost in southeastern Virginia, with CNN projecting that Republican state Sen. Jen Kiggans defeated Democratic Rep. Elaine Luria.
Another Jan. 6 committee member loses: Luria, a member of the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, lost her Virginia Beach-based House seat, CNN projected. She had defeated former GOP Rep. Scott Taylor in 2018 and 2020. But the district had become slightly more favorable ground for Republicans in redistricting: Biden carried the previous version by 5 points, and would have lost the new district by 2 points.
DeSantis and 2024: Gov. Ron DeSantis led a dominant Republican ticket in Florida – delivering historic margins in Democratic territory in his victory over Democratic Rep. Charlie Crist on a night that provides him a powerful argument if he seeks the GOP’s 2024 presidential nomination. The easy wins by DeSantis, who led by nearly 20 percentage points with 92% of the estimated vote counted, and Sen. Marco Rubio, who was 17 points up, were enough to cast doubt on Florida’s status as a national bellwether.
GOP makes gains with Latinos in Florida: Republicans hoped to build on Trump’s inroads among Latino voters in 2020, a trend that could reshape the political landscapes in several swing states if it continues. The strongest early signal that the GOP had continued to make gains came in Miami-Dade County, home to a large Cuban population. But it’ll take a while to fully gauge whether those GOP gains take place outside of Florida.
Win for abortion rights: In Michigan, Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer – who staked her reelection campaign on her successful efforts to block the enforcement of the state’s 1931 law banning abortion in almost all instances – defeated Republican challenger Tudor Dixon, who had waged a campaign focused on cultural battles. Michigan voters also approved a Whitmer-backed amendment to the state’s constitution that will scrap that 1931 law and guarantee abortion rights. Voters in California and Vermont also green-lit constitutional amendments enshrining abortion rights.

Maricopa County will post additional results on Wednesday night
From CNN’s Tara Subramaniam

 Election Day ballots from all 223 sites in Maricopa County, the most populous county in Arizona, have been reported as of 1:55 a.m local time, according to a tweet from the county’s elections department.
Additional results are expected to be posted Wednesday night, the county said.
As of 1:59 a.m. local time, with 90% of statewide precincts reporting, the Democratic candidates for the senate, governor and secretary of state were in the lead.
Earlier in the day, Maricopa County experienced technical problems with tabulation devices at about 20% of its voting locations, county officials said Tuesday morning, but there was no indication of intentional malfeasance despite claims to the contrary.

Multiple vehement election deniers will lose their gubernatorial races, CNN projects
From CNN's Daniel Dale 
Some of the most aggressive deniers of the 2020 election results will lose their 2022 gubernatorial races, CNN projects.
CNN found that at least 22 of the 36 Republican candidates for governor have rejected, declined to affirm, raised doubts about, or tried to overturn President Joe Biden’s victory.
Here are some of the candidates CNN projects will lose:
Doug Mastriano of Pennsylvania, who made extensive efforts to try to overturn Biden’s win. (As governor, Mastriano would have had the power to appoint the state elections chief.)
Dan Cox of Maryland, who said he didn’t recognize Biden as the president and who co-organized buses to the “Stop the Steal” rally on January 6, 2021.
Paul LePage of Maine, who falsely claimed that 2020 was “clearly a stolen election.”
Lee Zeldin of New York, who, as a member of Congress, voted against certifying Biden’s victories in Pennsylvania and Arizona.
Geoff Diehl of Massachusetts, who said in mid-2021 that the election wasn’t stolen but by 2022 was saying that it was certainly stolen.
Scott Jensen of Minnesota, who refused to affirm the legitimacy of Biden’s win and who baselessly suggested imprisoning the state’s Democratic elections chief. 
Tim Michels of Wisconsin, who baselessly claimed that “President Trump probably would be president right now if we had election integrity.”
Tudor Dixon of Michigan, who falsely claimed Trump won Michigan in 2020 even though he actually lost by more than 154,000 votes. 
Heidi Ganahl of Colorado, who refused on multiple occasions to say whether Biden was the legitimate winner and then selected a promoter of false election conspiracy theories as her running mate.
Some incumbents who denied or questioned the election results will win, CNN projects. They include:
Kay Ivey of Alabama, who ran an ad during her Republican primary that falsely claimed the 2020 election was stolen from Trump.

2022 midterm election results
By Aditi Sangal, Adrienne Vogt, Elise Hammond, Maureen Chowdhury, Clare Foran, Meg Wagner, Melissa Macaya, Joe Ruiz and Seán Federico-OMurchú, CNN
Updated 5:55 a.m. ET, November 9, 2022
What we covered here
Control of Senate and House still hang in the balance: It's too early to call key races — including in Nevada, Georgia, Wisconsin and Arizona — that could determine which party controls the chambers. Dozens of governorships, secretaries of states and attorneys general are also on the line.
First Senate flip of the night: Democrat John Fetterman will win Pennsylvania's Senate seat, CNN projects, and defeat Trump-backed Republican Mehmet Oz. The pick up is a big boost to Democrats' hopes of clinging to the Senate as the red wave that Republicans hoped for has yet to materialize in the House.
Historic firsts: Both parties are diversifying their ranks. Here's a look at the candidates CNN projects will make history.

CNN Projection: House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy will win reelection in California’s 20th District 
From CNN’s Clare Foran and Melanie Zanona

House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy has won reelection, CNN projects. McCarthy defeated longshot Democratic challenger Marisa Wood in the midterm race for California’s 20th Congressional District. 
If Republicans win back the House majority, McCarthy is widely expected to be elected as the next House Speaker at the start of the new session of Congress, which would further elevate his position as a prominent leader in the national Republican Party and usher in a new era in Washington with Republicans set to pursue aggressive oversight of President Joe Biden’s administration. 
As the top House Republican, McCarthy faces the challenge of having to balance the interests and priorities of different ideological factions within the House GOP conference, ranging from the far-right to more moderate members representing swing districts.

Republican Katie Britt will be the first female senator elected in Alabama, CNN projects, winning an open-seat race to succeed retiring GOP Sen. Richard Shelby.
Two women have previously represented Alabama in the Senate, but both were appointed to fill vacancies. 
Britt is just one of the projected winners who made history on Tuesday night. Here are a few others:

""A narrow chess game"": Here's where control of the Senate stands with key states still counting
From CNN's Elise Hammond
As polls in more western states start to close, Republicans have two more Senate seats than Democrats — needing to win four more to win control of the chamber.
Republicans are projected to win 46 seats and Democrats are projected to win 44, with many more states still counting ballots, but the window of opportunity could be getting smaller for Democrats, CNN’s John King said in analysis.
“We are in a very narrow chess game for control of the Senate right now, and we have fewer pieces in place,” he said Tuesday.
There are a handful of key states with results will coming that could determine who controls the chamber — Pennsylvania, Georgia and Nevada, King said.

CNN Projection: Democrat Marcy Kaptur will win reelection in competitive Ohio House race
From CNN’s Dan Merica

Democratic Rep. Marcy Kaptur has won reelection in Ohio’s 9th Congressional District, CNN projects, holding onto a seat she has represented since 1983.
Headed into the 2022 midterms, Kaptur was widely seen as one of the most vulnerable House Democrats in the country, with both Ohio and her district, in part because of redistricting, moving away from her party politically. 
But after Republican J.R. Majewski unexpectedly defeated better-funded and more establishment-aligned Republicans in the primary, the race began to tilt toward Kaptur given Majewski’s unflinching loyalty to former President Donald Trump, the fact he was a January 6, 2021, rally participant and has repeatedly shared pro-QAnon material, despite denying he followed the conspiracy theory movement. 
Kaptur effectively won the race in September after the National Republican Congressional Committee cancelled all their ad reservations in the district. The decision came just days after The Associated Press reported Majewski had misrepresented his military service. 
Kaptur’s win is a boon for Democrats. Kaptur’s district shifted dramatically during Ohio’s controversial redistricting process, moving from a solidly Democratic seat to one that leans toward Republicans. 
Kaptur ran on her ties to Ohio, arguing that being a Midwestern Democrat in a party increasingly run with big-city sensibilities on both coasts is a growing challenge for her. 
“What coastal people, God bless them, don’t understand, is that we lost our middle class,” Kaptur told CNN. “We lost so many people who’ve worked hard all their lives, including in many of these small towns. I understand that. We feel their pain. We went through it together.”

Two-term Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal will win reelection in Connecticut, CNN projects, and defeat Republican Leora Levy, a Trump-endorsed candidate who won her primary against a moderate Republican backed by the state’s Republican Party.

CNN Projection: Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom will win another term 
From CNN staff

Democratic incumbent Gavin Newsom will win another term as California's governor, CNN projects, a year after he faced a recall election. He defeated Republican state Sen. Brian Dahle. 
The recall effort against Newsom gained momentum over the governor’s strict Covid-19 restrictions, especially when he was seen as not following them himself. In California, Democrats outnumber Republicans nearly two to one, giving Democratic candidates a huge advantage in statewide races. 
The last Republican governor of the Golden State was Arnold Schwarzenegger, who served from 2003 to 2011.

CNN Projection: Maine Democratic Gov. Janet Mills holds on to her seat, winning second term in office

Democratic Gov. Janet Mills won a second term in office, CNN projected, defeating her predecessor, former Gov. Paul LePage, a right-wing Republican seeking to win back his old job after being forced out in 2019 due to state term limits. 
Mills became the state’s first female governor when she defeated Republican Shawn Moody in 2018, setting a record for the most votes received by any gubernatorial candidate in state history. 
Her defeat of LePage, an outspoken conservative who has described himself as “Trump before there was Trump,” is a rebuke to the former President’s political movement and a boon for Democrats, who entered the night defending 20 of the 36 contested governor’s offices nationwide. 
LePage not only made false claims about voter fraud in 2020, but has a history of alleging stolen elections, something he denied in a debate despite publicly available evidence to the contrary. The Republican’s campaign also attacked Mills over Covid-19 restrictions and the struggles of the state’s seafood industry, but Mills pushed back, touting her efforts to backstop it by, among other measures, sending federal relief cash to reimburse licensing fees paid up and down the supply chain.

CNN Projection: Democratic Sen. Alex Padilla will win election in California

Democratic Sen. Alex Padilla will win election in California, CNN projects, becoming the first elected Latino senator in state history. 
California Gov. Gavin Newsom appointed Padilla , the son of Mexican immigrant parents, to the seat that Kamala Harris vacated to become vice president in January 2021. 
Padilla will defeat Republican Mark Meuser in both a regular election for a six-year term as well as a special election for the remainder of Harris’ term that ends in January. 
Padilla and Meuser advanced to the general election after finishing in the top two in June in the state’s open primary, which sees candidates of all parties running on the same ballot with the top two moving on to November. 
Prior to his appointment to the Senate, Padilla was elected to two terms as California secretary of state. He entered politics as an aide to California Sen. Dianne Feinstein, now his fellow Democratic colleague in the Senate. 
He was elected to the Los Angeles City Council at 26 in 1999, later becoming the council’s youngest president in its history. In 2006, he was elected to the state Senate, representing the San Fernando Valley. 
In Congress, Padilla has been vocal on transportation and immigration policies. He chairs the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration, Citizenship, and Border Safety.

CNN projects that Wes Moore will become the first Black governor in Maryland’s history, defeating Republican state Delegate Dan Cox.
Moore will be just the third Black American to be elected governor of a US state. Virginia’s Douglas Wilder was the first in 1989, and Massachusetts’ Deval Patrick was the second in 2006.
Here’s a look at how Moore spent his Election Day:

CNN Projection: Republican Eric Schmitt will win Missouri Senate race
From CNN's Alex Rogers

Missouri attorney general Eric Schmitt will win an open Senate seat against Democrat Trudy Busch Valentine, CNN projects, ending one of the strangest races this election cycle, even if the final result was unsurprising. 
For months, Republicans from Washington to Missouri were concerned that former Gov. Eric Greitens would win the Senate Republican primary race, even though he resigned in disgrace in 2018, worrying that he would emerge from a large field of candidates desperately trying to win former President Donald Trump’s endorsement. 
In February, Schmitt declined to answer CNN’s question on whether the 2020. election was stolen, while standing by his decision to sign onto a 2020 Texas lawsuit to invalidate the results of swing states Trump lost, which was rejected by the Supreme Court. Other candidates, including Greitens, overtly sided with Trump. 
In June, John Wood, a former senior investigator for the House select committee investigating the January 6 attack on the US Capitol, launched an independent campaign with the backing of former Missouri GOP Sen. John Danforth. Then, a day before the August primary, Trump endorsed “ERIC,” urging voters to choose either Schmitt or Greitens. 
After getting pummeled on the air by the Senate Leadership Fund, the Mitch McConnell-aligned Super PAC, Greitens took third place, behind Rep. Vicky Hartzler and Schmitt. 
The general election without the scandal-ridden Greitens was comparatively conventional. After Schmitt won, Wood dropped out, removing the chance of a spoiler in a state that had not sent a Missouri Democrat to the Senate in a decade. 
Like Republicans across the country, Schmitt ran against the Biden administration, rising costs and crime. Valentine, an Anheuser-Busch heir who loaned over $10 million to her campaign, attacked him for banning abortion, even in cases of rape and incest, immediately after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. 
The race also turned personal. Valentine’s campaign essentially said that Schmitt sold out Missouri farmers to China. And Schmitt attacked Valentine’s pedigree, as she portrayed herself as a mother of six and former nurse, whose husband died of cancer and whose oldest son died after battling opioid addiction. 
In one ad, Schmitt said he learned the value of hard work from his blue-collar grandfather and father. He said in college, he gave tours and took out the trash “at the estate Trudy Busch Valentine grew up on.” In another, Schmitt said Valentine “comes from billions and doesn't care about what inflation is doing to your wallet.”

CNN Projection: Iowa GOP Sen. Chuck Grassley wins 8th term

Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley will win reelection in Iowa, CNN projects, fending off his toughest challenge since he first won the seat in 1980. 
Grassley defeated Mike Franken, a retired Navy admiral who campaigned with low expectations and little national Democratic support in the increasingly red state. 
Grassley, 89, is set to become the longest-serving current senator in January, replacing Vermont Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy, who is retiring. He would be 95 at the end of the eighth six-year term he won Tuesday.

Georgia Senate runoff election 
WATCH LIVE: CNN's special coverage of midterm election results
2022 midterm election results
By Aditi Sangal, Adrienne Vogt, Elise Hammond, Maureen Chowdhury, Clare Foran, Meg Wagner, Melissa Macaya, Joe Ruiz and Seán Federico-OMurchú, CNN
Updated 5:55 a.m. ET, November 9, 2022
What we covered here
Control of Senate and House still hang in the balance: It's too early to call key races — including in Nevada, Georgia, Wisconsin and Arizona — that could determine which party controls the chambers. Dozens of governorships, secretaries of states and attorneys general are also on the line.
First Senate flip of the night: Democrat John Fetterman will win Pennsylvania's Senate seat, CNN projects, and defeat Trump-backed Republican Mehmet Oz. The pick up is a big boost to Democrats' hopes of clinging to the Senate as the red wave that Republicans hoped for has yet to materialize in the House.
Historic firsts: Both parties are diversifying their ranks. Here's a look at the candidates CNN projects will make history.

CNN Projection: Trump-backed Harriet Hageman will win Wyoming House seat

Harriet Hageman, a Donald Trump ally who ousted Rep. Liz Cheney in August’s Republican primary, will win Wyoming’s at-large House seat, CNN projects.
Hageman defeated Democrat Lynnette Grey Bull, as well as contenders from the Libertarian and Constitution parties.
Her victory in the deep red state — Trump won Wyoming by 43 percentage points in 2020 — was all but guaranteed after she defeated Cheney in one of the nation’s most closely watched primaries.

CNN Projection: Democrat Josh Shapiro will win Pennsylvania governorship
From CNN’s Gregory Krieg

Democratic state Attorney General Josh Shapiro will be the next governor of Pennsylvania, CNN projects, defeating far-right Republican state lawmaker Doug Mastriano. 
Shapiro’s ascent means Democrats will keep control of the state’s top job, providing a powerful check on its GOP-held state legislature, as Gov. Tom Wolf leaves office due to term limits. Shapiro is also now poised to become a leading national Democratic figure short-listed for the party’s next open presidential primary. 
Most polling of the race before Election Day showed Shapiro with a comfortable lead over Mastriano, who was endorsed by former President Donald Trump shortly before the primary and chartered buses to Washington ahead of the former President’s “Stop the Steal” rally on January 6, 2021. (Mastriano says he never entered the US Capitol and has not been charged with any crimes.) 
But the Republican nominee’s support for expanded gun rights, strict anti-abortion laws and outspoken opposition to Covid-19 safety measures appeared to alienate voters in Pennsylvania’s decisive swing counties. 
Mastriano, a retired army colonel, was outpaced by Republican Senate candidate Mehmet Oz in polling throughout the general election season and Oz often made pains to distance himself from his fellow GOP nominee. 
Entering this campaign, Shapiro, who also outraised Mastriano by tens of millions of dollars, held the record for most votes won by a candidate in state history. In 2020, his 3.46 million ballots outpaced even Joe Biden, who ended up with roughly 3,000 fewer votes.

CNN Projection: Incumbent GOP Gov. Brian Kemp will defeat Stacey Abrams in Georgia governor race
From CNN’s Dan Merica

Republican Gov. Brian Kemp will be reelected in Georgia, CNN projects, defeating Democrat Stacey Abrams for a second time. 
Abrams has called Kemp to concede, according to a Kemp campaign source.
Kemp had been seen as the favorite in the race for months, with Abrams unable to capture the momentum she experienced in 2018 and hampered by broader voter discontent with Democratic control of Washington. 
The victory reasserts Republican control of the executive office in Georgia just two years removed from Democrats winning both of the state’s US Senate seats and President Joe Biden becoming the first Democrat to win the state since Bill Clinton in 1992. 
Abrams’ defeat is a tough blow for Democrats who have long sought to elevate her in a state that, until recently, had been dominated by Republicans. After losing to Kemp by less than two percentage points in 2018, Abrams was among the women considered to run alongside Biden. She is often touted as one of the most influential Democrats in the country, despite currently holding no public office. 
Kemp’s victory is a clear sign that economic arguments made by Republicans were more powerful in 2022 than Democrats’ focus on abortion. Abrams centered her campaign on the issue after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade over the summer. She told CNN in September that the issue was going to be “front and center in the conversation” -- specifically Kemp’s signing of a bill that bans most abortions when early cardiac activity is detected, when many women don’t yet know they’re pregnant. 
Kemp said on the campaign trail that he stood by that law, noting that it provided some exceptions. He instead spent much of his time focused on inflation, crime, and antipathy for Biden’s administration. 
“Georgians should know that my desire is to continue to help them fight through 40-year high inflation and high gas prices and other things that our Georgia families are facing right now, quite honestly, because of bad policies in Washington, DC, from President Biden and the Democrats that have complete control,” Kemp said at his first debate against Abrams.

CNN Projection: New Hampshire Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan will win reelection bid
From CNN’s Dan Merica

Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan will win her bid for reelection, CNN projects, defeating Republican Don Bolduc and delivering her party a key win in its bid to keep the Senate in Democratic control.
Hassan was widely seen as one of the most vulnerable Senate Democrats in the country at the start of the year, saddled with lagging economic indicators and President Joe Biden’s sluggish approval rating. 
But the Democratic senator -- aided by Bolduc being viewed by top Republicans in Washington and New Hampshire as out of step with the Granite State -- was successful in her bid for six more years in office after winning her first term by roughly a thousand votes out of more than 700,000 cast. 
Bolduc was widely written off by local and national Republicans, many of whom viewed him with skepticism as he rose during the primary and had grave concerns about his inability to raise money. After staking far-right positions on a range of topics to defeat a series of better funded Republican candidates, Bolduc attempted to walk back those positions almost as soon as he won the primary, including repeatedly pushing falsehoods around the validity of the 2020 election. 
Even with their doubts, though, Republicans spent more than $34 million on ads between Labor Day and Election Day pushing Bolduc, a sign of how vulnerable the party saw Hassan. 
Hassan’s successful attacks on Bolduc -- and the Republican’s less than clear pushback -- did little to assuage Republican concerns, leading the National Republican Senatorial Committee and Senate Leadership Fund to cut their planned spending in the state weeks before Election Day. The National Republican Senatorial Committee returned two weeks out with a small $1 million buy. 
Like many Democrats across the country, Hassan was powered by energy around the abortion debate and used former President Donald Trump and the unfounded denial rhetoric around the 2020 election to cast Bolduc as an extremist. 
“Let’s be very clear here: Don Bolduc is an election denier,” she said at a debate. “His refusal to accept election results means he doesn’t listen to you. This allows him to support an agenda that will raise your costs and eviscerate your rights, because at the end of the day, he doesn’t think he needs to listen, or isn’t accountable to you.”

Democratic incumbent Gavin Newsom will win another term as California's governor, CNN projects, a year after he faced a recall election. He defeated Republican state Sen. Brian Dahle. 
The recall effort against Newsom gained momentum over the governor’s strict Covid-19 restrictions, especially when he was seen as not following them himself. In California, Democrats outnumber Republicans nearly two to one, giving Democratic candidates a huge advantage in statewide races. 
The last Republican governor of the Golden State was Arnold Schwarzenegger, who served from 2003 to 2011."

After Hillary lost, she went for a walk in the woods, wrote books, did podcasts & traveled the world advocating for human rights & democracy at large.
She didn’t once call for the Constitution to be terminated.

But do go on about how women are “too emotional to lead” won’t you.

CNN Projection: Trump-backed Republican J.D. Vance will win Ohio Senate race 
From CNN’s Dan Merica

Republican J.D. Vance will win the Ohio Senate race, CNN projects, outlasting a stronger-than-expected challenge from Democrat Tim Ryan and keeping the seat under GOP control. 
Vance’s win is a boon for Republicans and a victory for former President Donald Trump, whose endorsement in the Republican primary helped Vance emerge from the contentious intraparty fight. 
Vance continues a long line of Republican victories in a state that has tilted towards the party in recent years. Other than Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown, no Democrat has won nonjudicial statewide office in the state since 2008 and former President Barack Obama was the last Democratic presidential nominee to win the state in 2012. 
The race between Vance and Ryan was a contentious and, at times, personal affair, with both candidates holding a clear animosity towards the other. 
Ryan’s stout challenge to Vance worried Republicans in Ohio and Washington, D.C. That contributed to the acrimony, a feeling that played out on the campaign trail and during their two debates, both of which devolved into Vance and Ryan trading personal barbs. 
“These leaders in DC will eat you up like a chew toy,” Ryan said of Vance’s support for Trump, even after the former president publicly accused him of “kissing my ass” to get him to campaign for him. “I am just telling you, like, I have been in this business, it is tough business. If you think you are going to help Ohio, you are not. If you can’t even stand up for yourself, how are you going to stand up for the people of this state?” 
And Vance repeatedly questioned Ryan’s character. “Tim Ryan has put on a costume where he pretends to be reasonable moderate,” the Republican said during their first debate. 
Money loomed large in the race, with Ryan consistently enjoying a significant fundraising advantage over Vance. 
In the third quarter of 2022, Ryan raised a sizable $17.2 million, compared to Vance’s $6.9 million. In the second quarter, the gap was even more dramatic: Ryan raised $9.1 million to Vance’s roughly $1 million. 
Still, because of Democratic skepticism about their chances in Ohio, Ryan had to largely go it alone in the state, pouring all the money he raised into a slate of television ads. Vance, by contrast, received considerable outside help – including from the Mitch McConnell-aligned Senate Leadership Fund, which announced in August it planned to spend at least $28 million in the state.

Texas Gov. Greg Abbott stresses calls for more border security in reelection speech
From CNN's Elise Hammond

Texas Gov. Greg Abbott pledged to do more to secure the border and congratulated other Republicans who are projected to win Tuesday.
“I ran for the farmers and ranchers down here on the border who pleaded for a more secure border in the state of Texas,” he said, adding that he will also continue to fight crime and “keep Texas number 1 in oil and gas” production in the US.
Abbott, who CNN projects will win reelection, said he will urge lawmakers to reinstate the Remain in Mexico policy and re-start building the border wall.
He thanked Texans who voted for him, assuring the crowd, ""we will go to work every single day to earn that trust.""
“All of you inspired me and all of your propelled me” to reelection, the governor added, saying he heard from voters that they just want to “keep Texas, Texas.”
""Together we will keep Texas the greatest state, in the greatest country, in the history of the world,"" Abbott added.
He touted other successes, including the quality of education, and funding law enforcement. The governor also congratulated “the next generation of Republicans” who were elected tonight.

But the Republican nominee’s support for expanded gun rights, strict anti-abortion laws and outspoken opposition to Covid-19 safety measures appeared to alienate voters in Pennsylvania’s decisive swing counties. 
Mastriano, a retired army colonel, was outpaced by Republican Senate candidate Mehmet Oz in polling throughout the general election season and Oz often made pains to distance himself from his fellow GOP nominee. 
Entering this campaign, Shapiro, who also outraised Mastriano by tens of millions of dollars, held the record for most votes won by a candidate in state history. In 2020, his 3.46 million ballots outpaced even Joe Biden, who ended up with roughly 3,000 fewer votes.

CNN Projection: Incumbent GOP Gov. Brian Kemp will defeat Stacey Abrams in Georgia governor race

Republican Gov. Brian Kemp will be reelected in Georgia, CNN projects, defeating Democrat Stacey Abrams for a second time. 
Abrams has called Kemp to concede, according to a Kemp campaign source.
Kemp had been seen as the favorite in the race for months, with Abrams unable to capture the momentum she experienced in 2018 and hampered by broader voter discontent with Democratic control of Washington. 
The victory reasserts Republican control of the executive office in Georgia just two years removed from Democrats winning both of the state’s US Senate seats and President Joe Biden becoming the first Democrat to win the state since Bill Clinton in 1992. 
Abrams’ defeat is a tough blow for Democrats who have long sought to elevate her in a state that, until recently, had been dominated by Republicans. After losing to Kemp by less than two percentage points in 2018, Abrams was among the women considered to run alongside Biden. She is often touted as one of the most influential Democrats in the country, despite currently holding no public office. 
Kemp’s victory is a clear sign that economic arguments made by Republicans were more powerful in 2022 than Democrats’ focus on abortion. Abrams centered her campaign on the issue after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade over the summer. She told CNN in September that the issue was going to be “front and center in the conversation” -- specifically Kemp’s signing of a bill that bans most abortions when early cardiac activity is detected, when many women don’t yet know they’re pregnant. 
Kemp said on the campaign trail that he stood by that law, noting that it provided some exceptions. He instead spent much of his time focused on inflation, crime, and antipathy for Biden’s administration. 
“Georgians should know that my desire is to continue to help them fight through 40-year high inflation and high gas prices and other things that our Georgia families are facing right now, quite honestly, because of bad policies in Washington, DC, from President Biden and the Democrats that have complete control,” Kemp said at his first debate against Abrams.

CNN Projection: New Hampshire Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan will win reelection bid
From CNN’s Dan Merica

Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan will win her bid for reelection, CNN projects, defeating Republican Don Bolduc and delivering her party a key win in its bid to keep the Senate in Democratic control.
Hassan was widely seen as one of the most vulnerable Senate Democrats in the country at the start of the year, saddled with lagging economic indicators and President Joe Biden’s sluggish approval rating. 
But the Democratic senator -- aided by Bolduc being viewed by top Republicans in Washington and New Hampshire as out of step with the Granite State -- was successful in her bid for six more years in office after winning her first term by roughly a thousand votes out of more than 700,000 cast. 
Bolduc was widely written off by local and national Republicans, many of whom viewed him with skepticism as he rose during the primary and had grave concerns about his inability to raise money. After staking far-right positions on a range of topics to defeat a series of better funded Republican candidates, Bolduc attempted to walk back those positions almost as soon as he won the primary, including repeatedly pushing falsehoods around the validity of the 2020 election. 
Even with their doubts, though, Republicans spent more than $34 million on ads between Labor Day and Election Day pushing Bolduc, a sign of how vulnerable the party saw Hassan. 
Hassan’s successful attacks on Bolduc -- and the Republican’s less than clear pushback -- did little to assuage Republican concerns, leading the National Republican Senatorial Committee and Senate Leadership Fund to cut their planned spending in the state weeks before Election Day. The National Republican Senatorial Committee returned two weeks out with a small $1 million buy. 
Like many Democrats across the country, Hassan was powered by energy around the abortion debate and used former President Donald Trump and the unfounded denial rhetoric around the 2020 election to cast Bolduc as an extremist. 
“Let’s be very clear here: Don Bolduc is an election denier,” she said at a debate. “His refusal to accept election results means he doesn’t listen to you. This allows him to support an agenda that will raise your costs and eviscerate your rights, because at the end of the day, he doesn’t think he needs to listen, or isn’t accountable to you.”

Sen. Tammy Duckworth will win reelection in Illinois, CNN projects, and defeat Republican Kathy Salvi.
When she was elected in 2016, Duckworth became the first disabled female senator. She was flying a helicopter in Iraq in 2004 when it was attacked and she lost both of her legs, and in 2018 she became the first senator to give birth while in office.

What we covered here
Control of Senate and House still hang in the balance: It's too early to call key races — including in Nevada, Georgia, Wisconsin and Arizona — that could determine which party controls the chambers. Dozens of governorships, secretaries of states and attorneys general are also on the line.
First Senate flip of the night: Democrat John Fetterman will win Pennsylvania's Senate seat, CNN projects, and defeat Trump-backed Republican Mehmet Oz. The pick up is a big boost to Democrats' hopes of clinging to the Senate as the red wave that Republicans hoped for has yet to materialize in the House.

CNN Projection: Democrat Josh Shapiro will win Pennsylvania governorship

Democratic state Attorney General Josh Shapiro will be the next governor of Pennsylvania, CNN projects, defeating far-right Republican state lawmaker Doug Mastriano. 
Shapiro’s ascent means Democrats will keep control of the state’s top job, providing a powerful check on its GOP-held state legislature, as Gov. Tom Wolf leaves office due to term limits. Shapiro is also now poised to become a leading national Democratic figure short-listed for the party’s next open presidential primary. 
Most polling of the race before Election Day showed Shapiro with a comfortable lead over Mastriano, who was endorsed by former President Donald Trump shortly before the primary and chartered buses to Washington ahead of the former President’s “Stop the Steal” rally on January 6, 2021. (Mastriano says he never entered the US Capitol and has not been charged with any crimes.)

Democratic incumbent Gavin Newsom will win another term as California's governor, CNN projects, a year after he faced a recall election. He defeated Republican state Sen. Brian Dahle. 
The recall effort against Newsom gained momentum over the governor’s strict Covid-19 restrictions, especially when he was seen as not following them himself. In California, Democrats outnumber Republicans nearly two to one, giving Democratic candidates a huge advantage in statewide races. 
The last Republican governor of the Golden State was Arnold Schwarzenegger, who served from 2003 to 2011.

The victory reasserts Republican control of the executive office in Georgia just two years removed from Democrats winning both of the state’s US Senate seats and President Joe Biden becoming the first Democrat to win the state since Bill Clinton in 1992. 
Abrams’ defeat is a tough blow for Democrats who have long sought to elevate her in a state that, until recently, had been dominated by Republicans. After losing to Kemp by less than two percentage points in 2018, Abrams was among the women considered to run alongside Biden. She is often touted as one of the most influential Democrats in the country, despite currently holding no public office. 
Kemp’s victory is a clear sign that economic arguments made by Republicans were more powerful in 2022 than Democrats’ focus on abortion. Abrams centered her campaign on the issue after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade over the summer. She told CNN in September that the issue was going to be “front and center in the conversation” -- specifically Kemp’s signing of a bill that bans most abortions when early cardiac activity is detected, when many women don’t yet know they’re pregnant. 
Kemp said on the campaign trail that he stood by that law, noting that it provided some exceptions. He instead spent much of his time focused on inflation, crime, and antipathy for Biden’s administration. 
“Georgians should know that my desire is to continue to help them fight through 40-year high inflation and high gas prices and other things that our Georgia families are facing right now, quite honestly, because of bad policies in Washington, DC, from President Biden and the Democrats that have complete control,” Kemp said at his first debate against Abrams.

CNN Projection: New Hampshire Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan will win reelection bid

Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan will win her bid for reelection, CNN projects, defeating Republican Don Bolduc and delivering her party a key win in its bid to keep the Senate in Democratic control.
Hassan was widely seen as one of the most vulnerable Senate Democrats in the country at the start of the year, saddled with lagging economic indicators and President Joe Biden’s sluggish approval rating. 
But the Democratic senator -- aided by Bolduc being viewed by top Republicans in Washington and New Hampshire as out of step with the Granite State -- was successful in her bid for six more years in office after winning her first term by roughly a thousand votes out of more than 700,000 cast. 
Bolduc was widely written off by local and national Republicans, many of whom viewed him with skepticism as he rose during the primary and had grave concerns about his inability to raise money. After staking far-right positions on a range of topics to defeat a series of better funded Republican candidates, Bolduc attempted to walk back those positions almost as soon as he won the primary, including repeatedly pushing falsehoods around the validity of the 2020 election. 
Even with their doubts, though, Republicans spent more than $34 million on ads between Labor Day and Election Day pushing Bolduc, a sign of how vulnerable the party saw Hassan. 
Hassan’s successful attacks on Bolduc -- and the Republican’s less than clear pushback -- did little to assuage Republican concerns, leading the National Republican Senatorial Committee and Senate Leadership Fund to cut their planned spending in the state weeks before Election Day. The National Republican Senatorial Committee returned two weeks out with a small $1 million buy. 
Like many Democrats across the country, Hassan was powered by energy around the abortion debate and used former President Donald Trump and the unfounded denial rhetoric around the 2020 election to cast Bolduc as an extremist. 
“Let’s be very clear here: Don Bolduc is an election denier,” she said at a debate. “His refusal to accept election results means he doesn’t listen to you. This allows him to support an agenda that will raise your costs and eviscerate your rights, because at the end of the day, he doesn’t think he needs to listen, or isn’t accountable to you.”

Sen. Tammy Duckworth will win reelection in Illinois, CNN projects, and defeat Republican Kathy Salvi.
When she was elected in 2016, Duckworth became the first disabled female senator. She was flying a helicopter in Iraq in 2004 when it was attacked and she lost both of her legs, and in 2018 she became the first senator to give birth while in office.

Democratic incumbent Gavin Newsom will win another term as California's governor, CNN projects, a year after he faced a recall election. He defeated Republican state Sen. Brian Dahle. 
The recall effort against Newsom gained momentum over the governor’s strict Covid-19 restrictions, especially when he was seen as not following them himself. In California, Democrats outnumber Republicans nearly two to one, giving Democratic candidates a huge advantage in statewide races. 
The last Republican governor of the Golden State was Arnold Schwarzenegger, who served from 2003 to 2011.

CNN Projection: Maine Democratic Gov. Janet Mills holds on to her seat, winning second term in office 
From CNN’s Gregory Krieg

Democratic Gov. Janet Mills won a second term in office, CNN projected, defeating her predecessor, former Gov. Paul LePage, a right-wing Republican seeking to win back his old job after being forced out in 2019 due to state term limits. 
Mills became the state’s first female governor when she defeated Republican Shawn Moody in 2018, setting a record for the most votes received by any gubernatorial candidate in state history. 
Her defeat of LePage, an outspoken conservative who has described himself as “Trump before there was Trump,” is a rebuke to the former President’s political movement and a boon for Democrats, who entered the night defending 20 of the 36 contested governor’s offices nationwide. 
LePage not only made false claims about voter fraud in 2020, but has a history of alleging stolen elections, something he denied in a debate despite publicly available evidence to the contrary. The Republican’s campaign also attacked Mills over Covid-19 restrictions and the struggles of the state’s seafood industry, but Mills pushed back, touting her efforts to backstop it by, among other measures, sending federal relief cash to reimburse licensing fees paid up and down the supply chain."

After Hillary lost, she went for a walk in the woods, wrote books, did podcasts & traveled the world advocating for human rights & democracy at large.
She didn’t once call for the Constitution to be terminated.

But do go on about how women are “too emotional to lead” won’t you.

 — 
As midterm results continue to roll in days after Election Day, Democratic and Republican candidates have already been celebrating historic victories.
Heading into Election Day, both parties were looking to diversify their ranks of elected officials, both in Congress and beyond, and they appear on track to do so.
House Republicans will add new members of color to their conference, including John James, who will be the first Black Republican congressman from Michigan, and Juan Ciscomani, who will be the first Latino Republican to represent Arizona in Congress.
Democrats will make a breakthrough for LGBTQ representation in governor’s offices. In Massachusetts and Oregon, Democrats Maura Healey and Tina Kotek will become the nation’s first out lesbian governors.
Republican Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the former Trump White House press secretary, will be the first female governor of Arkansas. And Maryland Democrat Wes Moore will be the state’s first Black governor.
There are still several races that have not yet been called. But for now, here’s a look at the candidates who CNN projects will make history in the 2022 midterms.
This list will be updated as more winners are projected.
Alabama

AL-SEN: Republican Katie Britt will be the first elected female senator from Alabama, CNN projects, winning an open-seat race to succeed her onetime boss, retiring GOP Sen. Richard Shelby. Britt is a former CEO of the Business Council of Alabama and was the heavy favorite in the general election in the deep-red state. Two women have previously represented Alabama in the Senate, but both were appointed to fill vacancies.
Arizona
AZ-06: Juan Ciscomani will be the first Latino Republican elected to Congress from Arizona, CNN projects, winning election to the state’s 6th Congressional District. Ciscomani, who was born in Mexico and immigrated to the US with his family as a child, previously worked at the Tucson Hispanic Chamber of Commerce and was a senior adviser to Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey.
Arkansas

AR-GOV: Republican Sarah Huckabee Sanders will be the first woman elected governor of Arkansas, CNN projects, winning the office her father previously held for over a decade. Sanders, who earned a national profile in her role as press secretary in the Trump White House, is also the first daughter in US history to serve as governor of the same state her father once led.
AR-LG: Republican Leslie Rutledge will be the first woman elected lieutenant governor of Arkansas, CNN projects. Rutledge, the state attorney general, originally sought the open governor’s seat but switched to the lieutenant governor’s race after Sanders entered the GOP gubernatorial primary. Lieutenant governors are elected on separate tickets in Arkansas.
With the election of Sanders and Rutledge, Arkansas will join Massachusetts as the first states to have women serving concurrently as governor and lieutenant governor.
California
CA-SEN: Democrat Alex Padilla will be the first elected Latino senator from California, CNN projects, winning a special election for the remainder of Kamala Harris’ term as well as an election for a full six-year term. Padilla, the son of Mexican immigrant parents, was appointed by California Gov. Gavin Newsom to the seat Harris vacated when she became vice president.
CA-SOS: Democrat Shirley Weber will be California’s first elected Black secretary of state of state, CNN projects. Weber, a former state assemblywoman, has been serving in the position since last year after Newsom picked her to succeed Padilla, who was appointed to the US Senate.
CA-AG: Democrat Rob Bonta will be California’s first elected Filipino American attorney general, CNN projects. Bonta, who was born in the Philippines and immigrated with his family to the US as an infant, has been serving in the position since last year after Newsom appointed him to succeed Xavier Becerra, who left to become President Joe Biden’s Health and Human Services secretary.
CA-42: Democrat Robert Garcia will be the first out LGBTQ immigrant elected to Congress, CNN projects, winning election to California’s 42nd Congressional District. Garcia, who immigrated from Lima, Peru, in the early 1980s at the age of 5, is the current mayor of Long Beach.
Los Angeles Mayor: Democrat Karen Bass will be the first woman and the first Black woman elected mayor of Los Angeles, CNN projects. Bass, who currently represents a Los Angeles-area House seat, will defeat real estate developer Rick Caruso. Bass was on Joe Biden’s short list for a running mate in the 2020 campaign. She’s no stranger to making history: She previously served in the California State Assembly, where in 2008 she became the first Black woman to serve as speaker of a state legislature.
Bass said on November 17, the day after her race was called, that the accomplishment of becoming the first female mayor of Los Angeles and the magnitude of the job was “sinking in.”
“To me, when you do make history, when you’re in a position like this – and I was in a similar position when I was sworn in as speaker – it means that you have extra responsibility. You always have to make sure that you maintain excellence in every step of the way,” she said. “The path that you go is laying the foundation for those that come behind you.”
Colorado
CO-08: Democrat Yadira Caraveo will be the first Latina elected to Congress from Colorado, CNN projects, winning the race for the state’s new 8th Congressional District. Caraveo, a state representative and the daughter of Mexican immigrant parents, will defeat Republican state Sen. Barbara Kirkmeyer to win the seat located north of Denver.
Connecticut
CT-SOS: Democrat Stephanie Thomas will be the first Black woman elected secretary of state of Connecticut, CNN projects. Thomas, a member of the Connecticut House, will succeed appointed Democratic incumbent Mark Kohler.
Florida

FL-10: Democrat Maxwell Frost will be the first member of Generation Z elected to Congress, CNN projects, winning the open seat for Florida’s 10th Congressional District. Generation Z refers to those born after 1996. Frost will succeed Democrat Val Demings, who vacated the seat to run for Senate.
The 25-year-old representative-elect told CNN’s Poppy Harlow on November 9 that when President Joe Biden called to congratulate him, the President recalled being too young to be sworn in as a senator when he was first elected at age 29.
“He asked me if it was the same situation. I said, ‘No, Mr. President, you had me beat on that. I’m already old enough to be sworn in on January 3.’ So, it was great to talk with him. You know, he was elected at a very young age, too, so he understands that experience,” Frost said on “CNN This Morning.”
Frost, who made reducing gun violence a central part of his campaign, also told CNN that he will work to pass universal background checks in Washington.
Illinois
IL-03: Democrat Delia Ramirez will be the first Latina elected to Congress from Illinois, CNN projects, winning election to the state’s redrawn 3rd Congressional District. Ramirez, a Chicago-area state representative and the daughter of Guatemalan immigrants, was also the first Guatemalan American to serve in the Illinois General Assembly.
IL-17: Democrat Eric Sorensen will be the first out gay person elected to Congress from Illinois, CNN projects, winning election to the state’s 17th Congressional District. Sorensen, a former Rockford and Quad Cities meteorologist, will defeat Republican Esther Joy King in the race to succeed retiring Democratic Rep. Cheri Bustos.
Maryland

MD-LG: Democrat Aruna Miller will be the first Asian American lieutenant governor of Maryland, CNN projects. Miller, who immigrated to the US with her family from India as a child, is a former member of the state House of Delegates. She was elected on the same ticket as Moore.
MD-AG: Anthony Brown will be the first Black person elected attorney general of Maryland, CNN projects. Brown, who currently represents Maryland’s 5th Congressional District, has a been a longtime fixture in state politics, having also served as state lieutenant governor and in the state House and run for governor in 2014.
Massachusetts

MA-GOV: Democrat Maura Healey will be one of the first out lesbian governors in US history, CNN projects, winning an open-seat race for the governorship of Massachusetts. Healey, the current attorney general of Massachusetts, will also be the commonwealth’s first elected female governor. Also making history with Healey as one of the nation’s first out lesbian governors is Oregon Democrat Tina Kotek.
With the election of Healey and her running mate, Kim Driscoll, Massachusetts will join Arkansas as the first states to have women serving concurrently as governor and lieutenant governor.
MA-AG: Democrat Andrea Campbell will be the first Black woman elected attorney general of Massachusetts, CNN projects. Campbell, who ran for Boston mayor last year, was previously the first Black female president of the Boston City Council.
Michigan
MI-10: John James will be the first Black Republican elected to Congress from Michigan, CNN projects, winning election to the state’s 10th Congressional District. James, who lost bids for US Senate in 2018 and 2020, will defeat Democrat Carl Marlinga in the open-seat race for the redrawn suburban Detroit district.
MI-13: Democrat Shri Thanedar will be the first Indian American elected to Congress from Michigan, CNN projects, winning election to the state’s 13th Congressional District. Thaneder, who immigrated to the US from India, was elected to the Michigan House in 2020 and unsuccessfully sought the Democratic nomination for governor in 2018.
Nevada
NV-SOS: Democrat Cisco Aguilar will be the first Latino elected secretary of state of Nevada, CNN projects. Aguilar, who is Mexican American, will defeat Republican nominee Jim Marchant, a former state assemblyman who has repeatedly promoted false conspiracy theories about elections in Nevada.
New York
NY-GOV: Democrat Kathy Hochul will be the first elected female governor of New York, CNN projects, winning a full four-year term to the office she assumed last year after Gov. Andrew Cuomo resigned. Hochul, who previously served as the state’s lieutenant governor and a Buffalo-area congresswoman, will defeat Republican Lee Zeldin.
NY-03: Republican George Santos will be the next congressman from New York’s 3rd Congressional District, CNN projects, winning the first House election between two out gay candidates. Santos, an investor and the son of Brazilian immigrants, will defeat Democrat Robert Zimmerman for the Long Island-based seat.
Ohio
OH-09: Democrat Marcy Kaptur will win a 21st term to the House from Ohio, CNN projects, and will become the longest-serving woman in Congress when she’s sworn in next year to represent the state’s 9th Congressional District. Kaptur, who was first elected in 1982 and is currently the longest-serving woman in House history, will break the record set by Barbara Mikulski, who represented Maryland in the House and Senate for a combined 40 years.
Oklahoma

Jim Inhofe, who is resigning in January. Mullin, a member of the Cherokee Nation, currently represents the state’s 2nd Congressional District. Democrat Robert Owen, also a member of the Cherokee Nation, represented Oklahoma in the Senate from 1907 to 1925.
Oregon
OR-GOV: Democrat Tina Kotek will be one of the first out lesbian governors in US history, CNN projects, after winning an open three-way race for the governorship of Oregon.

She will share the distinction as the nation’s first out lesbian governor with Massachusetts Gov.-elect Maura Healey.
OR-05: Republican Lori Chavez-DeRemer will join Democrat Andrea Salinas as the first Latino members of Congress from Oregon, CNN projects.

This story has been updated with additional developments.

What we covered here
Control of Senate and House still hang in the balance: It's too early to call key races — including in Nevada, Georgia, Wisconsin and Arizona — that could determine which party controls the chambers. Dozens of governorships, secretaries of states and attorneys general are also on the line.
First Senate flip of the night: Democrat John Fetterman will win Pennsylvania's Senate seat, CNN projects, and defeat Trump-backed Republican Mehmet Oz. The pick up is a big boost to Democrats' hopes of clinging to the Senate as the red wave that Republicans hoped for has yet to materialize in the House.
Historic firsts: Both parties are diversifying their ranks. Here's a look at the candidates CNN projects will make history.

CNN Projection: Greg Abbott will defeat Beto O’Rourke in Texas governor’s race 
From CNN’s Eric Bradner

Texas Gov. Greg Abbott has won a third term, CNN projects, fending off former Rep. Beto O’Rourke in a match-up in which Democrats had hoped to challenge Republicans’ decades of dominance in Austin. 
Abbott, who is viewed by some within the GOP as a potential 2024 presidential contender, survived O’Rourke’s criticism of his management of the state’s power grid, his response to mass shootings, including the one at an elementary school in Uvalde, and his opposition to abortion rights. 
The victory by Abbott underscores the extent to which Republicans remain dominant in Texas — buoyed in part by improved performances with Latino voters. 
Democrats have long hoped that the growing and increasingly diverse urban centers and suburbs of Texas would provide the party a path to competitiveness in the largest red state on America’s political map. 
O’Rourke got close in his 2018 Senate race against Republican Ted Cruz to becoming the first Democrat elected statewide in Texas since 1994. But polls this year showed him lagging farther behind Abbott as Republicans hammered Democrats across the nation over rising inflation and gas prices.

Biden advisers closely monitoring election returns
From CNN's MJ Lee
President Joe Biden’s advisers are closely monitoring the election returns as they continue to come in — and as of 10 p.m. on election night, they believe they are seeing a highly competitive landscape across the board. 
For the time being — with the important caveat that it’s still early and many races haven’t been called — Biden advisers feel that things are likely not headed towards a blowout that some had predicted heading into this week, particularly as they take stock of competitive House and gubernatorial that have already been called in their favor.
Biden has been making calls from the dining room off the Oval Office, according to a source familiar, and has called a number of Democrats tonight. He was also watching returns from his residence and stopped by to visit some of his staff watching from the Roosevelt Room.

Wes Moore, the projected winner in Maryland's governor race, told supporters ""our time is now"" during his victory speech.
Moore will be the first Black governor of the state and just the third Black American to be elected governor in US history.
Moore touted the diversity of his supporters and thanked them for their votes.
""It was your support, it was your sense of purpose that carried us across this state. All 24 jurisdictions from the western mountains to the eastern shore. From my birth place of Montgomery County to the adopted, to my adopted home of Baltimore City — Hey Baltimore. And everywhere in between,"" he said.
He continued, ""And the thing is, when I look across this room tonight, what we see right here is we see Maryland, right? We see people from all backgrounds, from all walks of life, from all income levels. We see teachers, we see small business owners, we see nurses, we see union members. All of you who’ve leant your voices and also gave your votes to this campaign and you said the same thing. Who all said with a collective voice that, “Our time is now.”
Moore also thanked his running mate Aruna Miller for her support. Miller immigrated with her family from India as a child and made history tonight becoming Maryland’s first Asian American lieutenant governor-elect. “It has been an absolute honor to go on this journey with you my friend,” he said.

As election results start rolling in, stock futures climb modestly
From CNN's Paul R. La Monica
US stocks were up in after-hours trading as results from Tuesday’s midterm elections started rolling in.
Investors have been betting on a big Republican wave in the elections. If Republicans take at least one chamber of Congress, that will likely result in more gridlock, which the market usually loves. Investors are more than happy when politicians bicker but don’t actually enact any new laws that may hurt corporate profits.
Dow futures were up 16 points, or about 0.1%. S&P 500 futures were up 0.2%, and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.4%.
Early results on election night can be very different from the final outcome once all the votes are tallied. That process can take days.
“If Republicans do well and take back control of one or both chambers of Congress, we see the event as a positive for the stock market into year-end,” Lori Calvasina, head of US equity strategy at RBC Capital Markets, said in a note to clients on Monday. “But if Republicans only take back control of the House, and not the Senate, we suspect the gains in the S&P 500 may be modest.”
Since 1948, the S&P 500 has had an annualized return of 16.9% during the nine years when a Democrat was in the White House and Republicans had a majority in both chambers of Congress, according to Edelman Financial Engines. That compares to 15.1% during periods of full Democratic control and 15.9% in years when there was a unified GOP government.
But at the end of the day, political headlines are often just noise for the markets. Ameriprise chief market strategist Anthony Saglimbene said on a conference call last week about the midterms that stocks have historically gone up after elections, no matter which party controls the White House and Congress.
Saglimbene noted that “growth, profits, inflation and interest rates” matter more to investors over the long haul.

CNN Projection: Republican Jen Kiggans will win hotly contested Virginia House race 
From CNN’s Dan Merica

Republican state Sen. Jen Kiggans will defeat Democratic Rep. Elaine Luria in Virginia’s 2nd Congressional District, CNN projects, a big win for Republicans as they vie to take back control of the House. 
Luria is a member of the House committee investigating the Jan. 6 riot at the US Capitol.
Kiggans was a top Republican recruit this cycle, taking advantage of Virginia’s redistricting process which shifted Luria’s district from a tough, but competitive, area for Democrats to an even steeper climb. That shift, and the prospect of Democrats losing a seat, turned the race between Luria and Kiggans into one of the closely watched contests in the nation. 
Luria ran on her role on the congressional committee investigating the January 6, 2021, insurrection at the US Capitol, hammering Kiggans for aligning herself with top Republicans who have diminished the attack on the Capitol, claiming it made her “not fit to serve in the United States Congress.” 
Kiggans, like many Republicans across the country, used rising prices and economic woes against Luria, arguing that “hard-working Americans are hurting from Joe Biden’s disastrous, failed economic policies. And in the 2nd Congressional District, these policies go by the name of Elaine Luria.” 
Republican confidence in winning the seat grew after the 2021 gubernatorial election in Virginia, where Republican Glenn Youngkin defeated Democrat Terry McAuliffe. Youngkin carried the area during the race, boosting Republican hopes of ousting the Democrat who won her first term in office in 2018.

After Hillary lost, she went for a walk in the woods, wrote books, did podcasts & traveled the world advocating for human rights & democracy at large.
She didn’t once call for the Constitution to be terminated.

But do go on about how women are “too emotional to lead” won’t you.

2022 midterm election results

Updated 5:55 a.m. ET, November 9, 2022
What we covered here
Control of Senate and House still hang in the balance: It's too early to call key races — including in Nevada, Georgia, Wisconsin and Arizona — that could determine which party controls the chambers. Dozens of governorships, secretaries of states and attorneys general are also on the line.
First Senate flip of the night: Democrat John Fetterman will win Pennsylvania's Senate seat, CNN projects, and defeat Trump-backed Republican Mehmet Oz. The pick up is a big boost to Democrats' hopes of clinging to the Senate as the red wave that Republicans hoped for has yet to materialize in the House.
Historic firsts: Both parties are diversifying their ranks. Here's a look at the candidates CNN projects will make history.

Georgia Senate race a seesaw, with Walker aides seeing optimism in uncounted votes in red counties
From CNN's Jeff Zeleny
The Georgia Senate race remains something of a seesaw tonight, with Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock and Republican challenger Herschel Walker seeing their advantages expand and contract throughout the evening. 
But at Walker’s campaign headquarters now, supporters are cheering as he narrowly took an edge over Warnock and inched closer to 50% – even as it remains entirely unclear whether the race will move to a Dec. 6 runoff.
Walker aides still see plenty of reasons to be optimistic tonight, with several counties in north Georgia – deep and reliably red – among those with a share of the outstanding vote. They believe the heavy Election Day vote benefits Walker.
Ralph Reed took the stage a few minutes ago and told supporters to settle in for a while longer, saying: “Get ready to party but it’s going to be a long night.”
So far tonight, only one thing is clear and constant: Republican Gov. Brian Kemp is outperforming Walker.
Kemp and Walker may share a political party, but tonight they are holding separate campaign parties – about two blocks apart in north Atlanta.

Pennsylvania Secretary of State pleads for patience during multi-day counting process

Pennsylvania’s acting secretary of state, Leigh M. Chapman, said it will take “a few days” for the state’s unofficial election results to be complete, and called on “voters, candidates and the media” to be patient.
“Election officials in all 67 counties are well aware that the eyes of the nation are on the Keystone State tonight,” Chapman said at a news conference in the state capital, Harrisburg. “And they are counting as fast as they can. But they are also prioritizing accuracy over speed, as they should.”
Chapman, a Democrat, cited “a handful of typical election day incidents,” including a few polling places opening late, power outages and a gas leak. But she said that “all were quickly handled.”
“In a very dynamic environment, Pennsylvania once again executed a free, fair and secure election,” Chapman said.

CNN Projection: Democrat Abigail Spanberger wins reelection in key Virginia House race
From CNN’s Dan Merica

Rep. Abigail Spanberger will win reelection in Virginia’s 7th Congressional District, CNN projects, a significant win in the Democratic Party’s bid to stem their losses in the 2022 midterms.
Spanberger will defeat Republican Yesli Vega, a Prince William County supervisor who Democrats spent millions to define as too extreme on abortion. The strategy, which seized on the momentum felt in the wake of the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade in June and Vega’s conservative views on the issue, worked for Democrats, who banked on the issue being critical to swing suburban voters in the district.
Spanberger, who was first elected to the House in 2018, was seen as a top target for Republicans, who got a boost when Republican Glenn Youngkin defeated Democrat Terry McAuliffe in the 2021 gubernatorial election in Virginia. Youngkin carried the area that made up Virginia’s 7th District, increasing Republican hopes of ousting the Democrat. 
Spanberger has now proven her ability to hold onto the once solidly red congressional seat after winning it in what was a good year for Democrats in 2018. By holding onto the seat in 2020 and 2022, Spanberger continues to be the only Democrat since 1971 to represent the district in Congress.

Republicans and Democrats hold 40 seats each in Senate as fight for control continues
As results roll in, the balance of the Senate is currently tied — both Republicans and Democrats are projected to now hold 40 seats each, with many more still with results coming in.
In the races that have been called since polls have been closing, CNN projected Democrats have won in four states and Republicans have won in 10 states, including an additional special election in Oklahoma.
Either party needs 50 seats to win the majority.

Exit polls: Voters who disliked both parties broke for Republicans
From CNN's Ariel Edwards-Levy
Most voters in this year’s election view one party positively, and the other negatively – nationally, about 4 in 10 have a favorable view of only the Democratic Party, and a similar share have a favorable view of only the Republican Party, according to the preliminary national results of the exit poll conducted for CNN and other news networks by Edison Research.
Unsurprisingly, these voters almost unanimously supported their favored party in their district’s congressional election.
But there’s also a smaller bloc of voters – about 11% of the electorate, nationwide – who dislike both parties. This group broke in favor of the Republicans, with nearly 6 in 10 favoring a GOP House candidate this year. That’s a shift from 2018, when voters who disliked both parties were about evenly split in their vote.
Voters who were most upset with the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade differed from those who felt less profoundly unhappy with the decision, the exit polls show. Those who were angry about the overturning of Roe (about 39% of the electorate) overwhelmingly voted Democratic for the House (about 85% picked the Democratic candidate). Those who were dissatisfied but not angry (about 21% of the electorate) narrowly favored the GOP.
There was also a difference between voters who were most pessimistic about the economy, and those who felt less strongly negative. While nearly 9 in 10 voters who said the economy was poor voted for a GOP House candidate, about 6 in 10 who described the economy as “not so good” backed a Democratic candidate.
To some extent, these divides reflect the partisan differences already baked into views on abortion and the economy. Voters who considered themselves Democrats were roughly 59 points more than voters who considered themselves Republican to say they were angry about Roe v. Wade being overturned. Republicans, meanwhile, were about 28 points likelier than Democrats to call the economy poor.

CNN Projection: Democrat Maura Healey will become Massachusetts’ first elected female governor
From CNN’s Gregory Krieg

Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey, a Democrat, has been elected as the Bay State’s governor, CNN projects, defeating GOP nominee Geoff Diehl, a state lawmaker who had been endorsed by former President Donald Trump.
Healey will become Massachusetts’ first elected female governor and the first out lesbian state executive in the US.
Her victory reclaims the office for Democrats, who have been shut out of the corner office for all but eight of the past 30 years, in the otherwise blue state. It also marks a pick-up for national Democrats who entered the night defending 20 of the 36 contested governor’s offices. 
Republican Gov. Charlie Baker decided not to seek a third term, despite his high approval ratings, after it became apparent that the Trump wing of the GOP was coalescing behind a primary challenge. 
Healey’s historic victory comes on the heels of Boston Mayor Michelle Wu’s own pathbreaking win a year earlier, when Wu became the first woman elected to lead the city. Unlike Diehl, who defeated a moderate Republican opponent in the primary, Healey ran effectively unopposed, with her January 2022 decision to enter the contest clearing the Democratic field.

Democratic Rep. Peter Welch will be the next US senator from Vermont, CNN projects, defeating Republican nominee Gerald Malloy to keep the seat held for decades by retiring Sen. Pat Leahy in Democratic hands. 
Welch will join Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent who caucuses with the Democrats, in representing Vermont in the upper chamber. He announced his plans to leave the House and run for the Senate shortly after Leahy announced in November 2021 that he would not seek re-election after spending nearly 50 years in Congress.

""A win for the ages"": Gov. Ron DeSantis thanks Florida voters for reelecting him
From CNN’s Elise Hammond

Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who won reelection according to CNN projections, thanked voters for supporting him and his policies, touting “we have not only won an election, we have rewritten the political map.”
“Thank you for honoring us with a win for the ages,” DeSantis said.
The governor also thanked voters who didn’t vote for him in the last election, saying that he is “honored to have earned your trust and your support over these four years” for reelection now. 
DeSantis said that while Tuesday’s results were explicitly for the midterm elections, “but in reality Americans have been voting for many years now, they have been voting with their feet,” meaning that people who are not happy with policies in other states have been moving to Florida, according to DeSantis, pointing to things like crime and the economy.
""People come here because our policies work, leadership matters,"" he added.

What we covered here
Control of Senate and House still hang in the balance: It's too early to call key races — including in Nevada, Georgia, Wisconsin and Arizona — that could determine which party controls the chambers. Dozens of governorships, secretaries of states and attorneys general are also on the line.
First Senate flip of the night: Democrat John Fetterman will win Pennsylvania's Senate seat, CNN projects, and defeat Trump-backed Republican Mehmet Oz. The pick up is a big boost to Democrats' hopes of clinging to the Senate as the red wave that Republicans hoped for has yet to materialize in the House.
Historic firsts: Both parties are diversifying their ranks. Here's a look at the candidates CNN projects will make history.

From recreational marijuana to voting initiatives, here are the latest decisions on key ballot measures
From CNN’s Shawna Mizelle, Ethan Cohen and Melissa Holzberg DePalo

Voters around the country weighed in on key ballot measures on Tuesday, including initiatives that require IDs to vote and others that would legalize recreational marijuana.
Here's what we know so far:
Marijuana
Arkansas voters reject recreational marijuana ballot initiative: Arkansas voters on Tuesday rejected a constitutional amendment that would have allowed cannabis possession and recreational consumption by adults as well as the sale by licensed facilities, CNN projects. Had it passed, cannabis possession of up to an ounce would have been legal and some tax revenue from marijuana sales would have contributed to funding law enforcement.
Maryland legalizes recreational marijuana with ballot measure: Maryland voters on Tuesday approved a constitutional amendment that legalizes recreational marijuana for people 21 and older. It will go into effect on July 1, 2023, and allow possession of 1.5 ounces or two plants. Possession of small amounts of marijuana was already decriminalized in Maryland. Under the amendment, those previously convicted of cannabis possession and intent to distribute will be able to apply for record expungement. 
Voters end prohibitions on marijuana in Missouri: Missouri voters on Tuesday approved a constitutional amendment that ends prohibitions on marijuana in the state and allows personal use for those or those over the age of 21, CNN projects. It will allow personal possession up to 3 ounces. Additionally, the amendment allows individuals with marijuana-related non-violent offenses to petition for release from prison or parole and probation and have their records expunged. The amendment, which will be enacted 30 days after the election, prohibits marijuana facilities from selling cannabis-infused products shaped or packaged as candy that may be attractive to children. 
North Dakota voters reject ballot measure to legalize recreational marijuana: A citizen-initiated ballot measure that aimed to allow the use of marijuana in ""various forms"" for those who are at least 21 years-old was rejected by North Dakota voters, CNN projects. It would have allowed marijuana possession of up to an ounce and all marijuana is to be tested in a facility ""for the potency of products and the presence of pesticides"" and subject to random inspection. Legalization was on the ballot in four other states this November. 
South Dakota voters reject proposal to legalize recreational marijuana: Voters in South Dakota rejected a ballot measure that aimed to legalize marijuana for recreational use in the state, CNN projects. Marijuana legalization previously passed in 2020, but South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem’s office championed efforts to nullify the legalization saying that it violated the state’s constitution. The Republican governor’s office previously indicated to CNN that the 2022 measure appears to be written constitutionally and she would have implemented it if it passed. 
Voting
Nebraska voters approve measure to require ID to cast ballot: Nebraska voters have approved an initiative that would amend the state constitution to require that voters present a valid photo identification in a way that is specified by the legislature, CNN projects. To pass, “yes” needed to win a majority and votes equal to at least 35% of total votes cast in the election. 
Connecticut passes ballot measure to allow early voting: Connecticut voters have approved a measure that would amend the state constitution to permit the legislature to enact early voting, CNN projects.

Here are some key takeaways from Election Night — and where things stand now 
From CNN's Eric Bradner, Dan Merica and Gregory Krieg
The battle for control of Congress – both the House and the Senate – is coming down to a dwindling number of key races, with Democrats dashing Republicans’ hopes for a red wave and both parties hanging onto hopes of winning narrow majorities.
Republicans began the night with a rout in Florida, where Gov. Ron DeSantis won heavily Latino, historically Democratic regions on his way to a blowout victory that could serve as a launch pad for a 2024 presidential run.
But in the hours that have followed, Democrats have fought back. In Pennsylvania, Democratic Lt. Gov. John Fetterman defeated Republican Mehmet Oz for the seat of retiring Republican Sen. Pat Toomey.
Meanwhile, the battle for the House majority – one that favored Republicans, who expected to benefit from high inflation, historical trends and friendly new district lines after 2021’s redistricting – remains unsettled.
Here are some key takeaways as votes continue to be counted in key races:
Democrats go a long way to protecting their Senate majority: Republicans were not shy about the importance of Pennsylvania’s Senate race: “This is a must-win race. We believe if we win Pennsylvania, we win the majority,” said Steven Law, president of the preeminent Republican Senate super PAC. Early on Wednesday morning, CNN projected that Fetterman would be the next senator from Pennsylvania, defeating Oz in the most expensive and high stakes Senate campaign in the country. Fetterman’s win was a thunderclap for Democrats.
Democrats and the suburbs: Suburban areas across the country went a long way to helping Democrats avoid a significant red wave. Republicans may still win the House, but if the 2022 election was going to be a red wave, it was likely to come through suburban victories that have not materialized yet. Republicans did score some suburban victories – CNN projected Brandon Ogles the winner in a district around Nashville, Tom Kean Jr. winning in a suburban New Jersey district and Rich McCormick the victor in a district that included Atlanta’s northern suburbs – but it was their defeats that spoke volumes about the size of the GOP wave.
Virginia’s split decision offers early signals: Three Democratic-controlled House races in Virginia were widely viewed as an early warning signal of the night’s results. Democrats held seats in two Virginia districts Biden won in 2020. CNN projected that Democratic Jennifer Wexton won her reelection bid in Virginia’s 10th District. In an even more competitive race, CNN projected Rep. Abigail Spanberger also won reelection in Virginia’s 7th District. But Democrats lost in southeastern Virginia, with CNN projecting that Republican state Sen. Jen Kiggans defeated Democratic Rep. Elaine Luria.
Another Jan. 6 committee member loses: Luria, a member of the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, lost her Virginia Beach-based House seat, CNN projected. She had defeated former GOP Rep. Scott Taylor in 2018 and 2020. But the district had become slightly more favorable ground for Republicans in redistricting: Biden carried the previous version by 5 points, and would have lost the new district by 2 points.
DeSantis and 2024: Gov. Ron DeSantis led a dominant Republican ticket in Florida – delivering historic margins in Democratic territory in his victory over Democratic Rep. Charlie Crist on a night that provides him a powerful argument if he seeks the GOP’s 2024 presidential nomination. The easy wins by DeSantis, who led by nearly 20 percentage points with 92% of the estimated vote counted, and Sen. Marco Rubio, who was 17 points up, were enough to cast doubt on Florida’s status as a national bellwether.
GOP makes gains with Latinos in Florida: Republicans hoped to build on Trump’s inroads among Latino voters in 2020, a trend that could reshape the political landscapes in several swing states if it continues. The strongest early signal that the GOP had continued to make gains came in Miami-Dade County, home to a large Cuban population. But it’ll take a while to fully gauge whether those GOP gains take place outside of Florida.
Win for abortion rights: In Michigan, Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer – who staked her reelection campaign on her successful efforts to block the enforcement of the state’s 1931 law banning abortion in almost all instances – defeated Republican challenger Tudor Dixon, who had waged a campaign focused on cultural battles. Michigan voters also approved a Whitmer-backed amendment to the state’s constitution that will scrap that 1931 law and guarantee abortion rights. Voters in California and Vermont also green-lit constitutional amendments enshrining abortion rights.
A night of firsts: Up and down the ballot, in red states and blue, candidates from both parties are celebrating pathbreaking victories. Read about some of them here.

Maricopa County will post additional results on Wednesday night
From CNN’s Tara Subramaniam

 Election Day ballots from all 223 sites in Maricopa County, the most populous county in Arizona, have been reported as of 1:55 a.m local time, according to a tweet from the county’s elections department.
Additional results are expected to be posted Wednesday night, the county said.
As of 1:59 a.m. local time, with 90% of statewide precincts reporting, the Democratic candidates for the senate, governor and secretary of state were in the lead.
Earlier in the day, Maricopa County experienced technical problems with tabulation devices at about 20% of its voting locations, county officials said Tuesday morning, but there was no indication of intentional malfeasance despite claims to the contrary.

Multiple vehement election deniers will lose their gubernatorial races, CNN projects
From CNN's Daniel Dale 
Some of the most aggressive deniers of the 2020 election results will lose their 2022 gubernatorial races, CNN projects.
CNN found that at least 22 of the 36 Republican candidates for governor have rejected, declined to affirm, raised doubts about, or tried to overturn President Joe Biden’s victory.
Here are some of the candidates CNN projects will lose:
Doug Mastriano of Pennsylvania, who made extensive efforts to try to overturn Biden’s win. (As governor, Mastriano would have had the power to appoint the state elections chief.)
Dan Cox of Maryland, who said he didn’t recognize Biden as the president and who co-organized buses to the “Stop the Steal” rally on January 6, 2021.
Paul LePage of Maine, who falsely claimed that 2020 was “clearly a stolen election.”
Lee Zeldin of New York, who, as a member of Congress, voted against certifying Biden’s victories in Pennsylvania and Arizona.
Geoff Diehl of Massachusetts, who said in mid-2021 that the election wasn’t stolen but by 2022 was saying that it was certainly stolen.
Scott Jensen of Minnesota, who refused to affirm the legitimacy of Biden’s win and who baselessly suggested imprisoning the state’s Democratic elections chief. 
Tim Michels of Wisconsin, who baselessly claimed that “President Trump probably would be president right now if we had election integrity.”
Tudor Dixon of Michigan, who falsely claimed Trump won Michigan in 2020 even though he actually lost by more than 154,000 votes. 
Heidi Ganahl of Colorado, who refused on multiple occasions to say whether Biden was the legitimate winner and then selected a promoter of false election conspiracy theories as her running mate.
Some incumbents who denied or questioned the election results will win, CNN projects. They include:
Kay Ivey of Alabama, who ran an ad during her Republican primary that falsely claimed the 2020 election was stolen from Trump.
Brad Little of Idaho, who endorsed the Texas-led lawsuit in 2020 that sought to get the Supreme Court to overturn Biden’s win.
Kim Reynolds of Iowa, who expressed support for that Texas-led lawsuit (though she later said Biden was legitimately elected).
Greg Abbott of Texas, who also expressed support for the lawsuit led by the attorney general of his state. 
Kristi Noem of South Dakota, who baselessly claimed on Twitter that Trump was fighting “rigged election systems” and hinted that there were issues in “Democrat-run” states.

CNN Projection: Republican Sarah Huckabee Sanders will win Arkansas governorship 
From CNN staff 
(Andrew Harnik/AP)
Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the one-time press secretary and communications director for former President Donald Trump, will win Arkansas’ gubernatorial race, CNN projects. 
She will be the first woman elected governor of Arkansas. 
Huckabee Sanders defeated Democrat Chris Jones, who is a minister and former non-profit leader who got a degree in nuclear engineering from MIT. 
Arkansas last elected a Democratic governor in 2010 and it’s now a solidly red state. 
Sanders, while a first-time candidate, is no stranger to politics. Her father, Republican Mike Huckabee, was governor of Arkansas from 1996 to 2007. And by defeating Democrat Chris Jones, Sanders will also become the first daughter in US history to serve as governor of the same state her father once led. 
Sanders previously worked for two years in the George W. Bush administration and later ran her father’s 2008 campaign for the Republican presidential nomination and then was campaign manager for his 2016 bid. 
She gained national prominence in her role as former President Donald Trump’s White House press secretary, serving as a staunch defender of the then-President and his policies for more than two years. On many occasions, she clashed with national reporters and eventually scaled back televised briefings. She defended the move, saying that journalists could hear from Trump directly. 
Sanders earned an early endorsement from Trump after joining the race for Arkansas governor, and prominent rivals later dropped out of the race, clearing her path to the GOP nomination. 
Sanders’ path to victory in the race to succeed term-limited GOP Gov. Asa Hutchison was relatively smooth – unsurprising in a state that has taken a sharp turn to the right in recent years. But the campaign was not without personal challenges. In September, Sanders announced she was diagnosed with thyroid cancer and “underwent a successful surgery to remove my thyroid and surrounding lymph nodes.” 
In her race for governor, Sanders defended her decision to grant only a handful of interviews with local media, saying she’s been speaking to voters directly. 
“Freedom of the press is incredibly important, but with freedom of the press also comes a great deal of responsibility, and when they don’t live up to their end of the bargain, it forces some of us to go outside of the box, which I have done every single day for the last two years,” Sanders said at an October 21 debate hosted by the Arkansas PBS station. 
In the debate, Sanders highlighted key issues of her campaign, including her education plan, Arkansas LEARNS, to increase literacy rates, and her support for phasing out the state income tax, though she has not explicitly stated a timeline for doing so.
CNN's Andrew Menezes contributed reporting to this post.

CNN Projection: Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer will win reelection in New York 
From CNN's Alex Rogers

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer will win reelection in New York, CNN projects, and defeat Republican Joe Pinion. 
Pinion briefly hosted a show on Newsmax and has worked as the director of a youth development at Morris Height Health Center in the Bronx. 
Schumer's victory will make him the longest-serving senator from New York after he’s sworn in next year. 
Over 48 years, Schumer has never lost a race, rising from the state Assembly to the House of Representatives to the pinnacle of power in the Senate. 
While seeking to keep Democratic control of the 50-50 Senate this year, Schumer continued his tradition of visiting the Empire State’s 62 counties, and his campaign built an overwhelming financial advantage over his Republican opponent, Joe Pinion, a former host and conservative commentator on Newsmax. 
Pinion tried to turn Schumer’s longevity into a weakness, blaming him for a poor economy and charging that it’s time to turn the page. 
“He is, in fact, an exceptional politician, one of the best that has ever lived,” said Pinion at a recent debate hosted by Spectrum News. “But he’s a failed senator. He has failed the people of this state on multiple occasions.” 
At the debate, Schumer touted the Senate’s past two years and boasted that “for the first time,” New York received more money from Washington than it sent. He then ticked off the major legislation passed by this Congress: granting Medicare the power to negotiate lower prices for some drugs, what he called “the most important climate change bill ever” and bipartisan gun safety and infrastructure bills. He also pledged to protect abortion rights after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. 
“In the last two years, under my leadership, the Senate has had the most productive session in decades,” said Schumer. 
The Brooklyn-bred New Yorker, the son of an exterminator and housewife, leaned into his Jewish background in one ad by teaching various Yiddish words -- calling Republican political leaders “schmos” and describing the “naches” he felt in passing the Inflation Reduction Act. 
“Fighting for New York is no shtick for me,” he added.

It’s 9 p.m. ET. Polls are closing in Arizona, Texas, New York and 12 other states 
From CNN’s Ethan Cohen and Melissa Holzberg DePalo 
It’s 9 p.m. ET, and polls are closing in these states: 
Arizona 
Colorado 
Iowa 
Kansas 
Louisiana 
Michigan 
Minnesota 
Nebraska 
New Mexico 
New York 
North Dakota 
South Dakota 
Texas 
Wisconsin 
Wyoming 
Here’s what to know about the key races in Arizona: Republicans hope to take Arizona back after Democrats made inroads in the swing state in 2020 when President Biden won the state and Mark Kelly flipped a Senate seat for Democrats. 
However, the GOP isn’t putting up moderate Republicans to help that cause. Republican gubernatorial nominee Kari Lake and GOP Senate nominee Blake Masters were both endorsed by Trump and have expressed skepticism that Biden legitimately won the state. 
These are the key races in Michigan: All eyes in Michigan will be on the state’s gubernatorial race as Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer faces conservative commentator Tudor Dixon, who’s hoping her Trump endorsement will help turn the state back towards Republicans. 
The right to abortion will also be on the ballot. Democrats hope the issue will help boost turnout among their base voters. 
Voting and elections will also be key issues, as Michigan voters will decide on a ballot measure to expand access to the ballot, and elect a new secretary of state. Incumbent Democrat Jocelyn Benson faces Republican Kristina Karamo, who has backed Trump’s lies about the 2020 election. 
And these are the races playing out in Wisconsin: Wisconsin is one of the most closely divided states in the nation, and GOP Sen. Ron Johnson and Democratic Gov. Tony Evers both face highly competitive reelection campaigns. 
Johnson, who has a history of controversial statements about the pandemic and the Jan. 6 attack, is facing Democratic Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes, who at one point signaled support for removing police funding. 
Evers faces Republican businessman Tim Michels, who won Trump’s support in the primary by aggressively amplifying the former president’s 2020 election lies.

2022 midterm election results
By Aditi Sangal, Adrienne Vogt, Elise Hammond, Maureen Chowdhury, Clare Foran, Meg Wagner, Melissa Macaya, Joe Ruiz and Seán Federico-OMurchú, CNN
Updated 5:55 a.m. ET, November 9, 2022
What we covered here
Control of Senate and House still hang in the balance: It's too early to call key races — including in Nevada, Georgia, Wisconsin and Arizona — that could determine which party controls the chambers. Dozens of governorships, secretaries of states and attorneys general are also on the line.
First Senate flip of the night: Democrat John Fetterman will win Pennsylvania's Senate seat, CNN projects, and defeat Trump-backed Republican Mehmet Oz. The pick up is a big boost to Democrats' hopes of clinging to the Senate as the red wave that Republicans hoped for has yet to materialize in the House.
Historic firsts: Both parties are diversifying their ranks. Here's a look at the candidates CNN projects will make history.

Exit polls: Pennsylvania voters are split over Fetterman’s health
From CNN's Tami Luhby
Voters in Pennsylvania are split over whether Democratic Senate candidate John Fetterman’s health is good enough to represent the state effectively, according to the preliminary results of the Pennsylvania exit poll conducted for CNN and other news networks by Edison Research.
Fetterman, Pennsylvania’s lieutenant governor, suffered a near-fatal stroke days before he won the May Democratic primary.
But a majority of voters said that Mehmet Oz, the Republican candidate for Senate, has not lived in the commonwealth long enough to represent it effectively. More than 4 in 10 said he had.
Oz has said he moved to Pennsylvania in late 2020 after living in New Jersey for decades.
Voters also split over which candidate’s views are too extreme with more than 4 in 10 picking Fetterman and the same share selecting Oz.
More than one-third of Pennsylvania voters said that they care most about whether a candidate shares their values and whether a candidate has honesty and integrity. About 2 in 10 said the most important quality is that a candidate cares about people like them. Fewer than one in 10 said having the right experience matters most.
Men and women who cast ballots split their support, with more than half of men voting for Oz and more than half of women voting for Fetterman. Among independent voters, who made up about a quarter of the electorate, more than half voted for Fetterman.
For voters who thought that abortion was the most important issue, more than three quarters supported Fetterman. They made up just over one-third of the electorate.
But among those who said inflation was the most pressing issue, more than three-quarters cast ballots for Oz. They made up more than a quarter of the electorate.

Pennsylvania's Allegheny County receives final batch of mail-in and absentee ballots
From CNN’s Brian Todd and Dugald McConnell
At the Allegheny County Elections warehouse in Pennsylvania, they’re about to get the final mail-in and absentee ballots that were dropped off personally by voters. 
The last ones which were sent by mail were just dropped off here. There were 3,058 of those, the county spokesperson told CNN. 
A total of 156,000 mail-ins/absentee votes — which had already been sent in — were processed at the warehouse earlier today. 
Now that polls have closed, they will assign all those votes to candidates. 
Rich Fitzgerald, executive of Allegheny County, said that Democrats Josh Shapiro, candidate for governor, and John Fetterman, candidate for Senate, have out-performed Joe Biden in the mail-in and absentee voting in Allegheny County. 
In 2010 Biden got about 80% of the mail-in and absentee voting in Allegheny, Fitzgerald said.
Shapiro won 89% of that vote tonight and Fetterman won about 85% of it in the Senate race, he said.
Fitzgerald said he expects the Allegheny vote count, overall, to be done quickly tonight.

Democrat leads in North Carolina’s Senate race — but results are coming from mostly early voting
From CNN's Elise Hammond

In North Carolina’s Senate race, Democratic candidate Cheri Beasley is leading her opponent, Republican Ted Budd — but most of those results are coming from early voting.
The polls closed at 7:30 p.m. ET and these early voting numbers show about 53% of the estimated vote being reported, CNN’s David Chalian said in analysis. Of the current votes that are in, 96% are coming from early voting.
“At the end of the day we think in North Carolina, only 55% is going to be pre-election vote,” Chalian explained, adding that generally, early voting tends to favor Democrats. “So right now most of what you are seeing there is pre-election vote.”
Here’s how the results break down even further:
Among people who voted by mail, Beasley leads by 46%, with still about 24% of ballots left to be counted.
For those who voted early, Beasley also leads by 6.2%, with about 5% still to be counted.
Budd, however, leads by more than 37% in votes cast on Election Day — but there is still a lot left to go. More than 95% of Election Day votes have not been counted yet.

After Hillary lost, she went for a walk in the woods, wrote books, did podcasts & traveled the world advocating for human rights & democracy at large.
She didn’t once call for the Constitution to be terminated.

But do go on about how women are “too emotional to lead” won’t you.

 — 
As midterm results continue to roll in days after Election Day, Democratic and Republican candidates have already been celebrating historic victories.
Heading into Election Day, both parties were looking to diversify their ranks of elected officials, both in Congress and beyond, and they appear on track to do so.
House Republicans will add new members of color to their conference, including John James, who will be the first Black Republican congressman from Michigan, and Juan Ciscomani, who will be the first Latino Republican to represent Arizona in Congress.
Democrats will make a breakthrough for LGBTQ representation in governor’s offices. In Massachusetts and Oregon, Democrats Maura Healey and Tina Kotek will become the nation’s first out lesbian governors.
Republican Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the former Trump White House press secretary, will be the first female governor of Arkansas. And Maryland Democrat Wes Moore will be the state’s first Black governor.
There are still several races that have not yet been called. But for now, here’s a look at the candidates who CNN projects will make history in the 2022 midterms.
This list will be updated as more winners are projected.
Alabama

Butch Dill/AP
AL-SEN: Republican Katie Britt will be the first elected female senator from Alabama, CNN projects, winning an open-seat race to succeed her onetime boss, retiring GOP Sen. Richard Shelby. Britt is a former CEO of the Business Council of Alabama and was the heavy favorite in the general election in the deep-red state. Two women have previously represented Alabama in the Senate, but both were appointed to fill vacancies.
Arizona
AZ-06: Juan Ciscomani will be the first Latino Republican elected to Congress from Arizona, CNN projects, winning election to the state’s 6th Congressional District. Ciscomani, who was born in Mexico and immigrated to the US with his family as a child, previously worked at the Tucson Hispanic Chamber of Commerce and was a senior adviser to Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey.
Arkansas

AR-GOV: Republican Sarah Huckabee Sanders will be the first woman elected governor of Arkansas, CNN projects, winning the office her father previously held for over a decade. Sanders, who earned a national profile in her role as press secretary in the Trump White House, is also the first daughter in US history to serve as governor of the same state her father once led.
AR-LG: Republican Leslie Rutledge will be the first woman elected lieutenant governor of Arkansas, CNN projects. Rutledge, the state attorney general, originally sought the open governor’s seat but switched to the lieutenant governor’s race after Sanders entered the GOP gubernatorial primary. Lieutenant governors are elected on separate tickets in Arkansas.
With the election of Sanders and Rutledge, Arkansas will join Massachusetts as the first states to have women serving concurrently as governor and lieutenant governor.
California
CA-SEN: Democrat Alex Padilla will be the first elected Latino senator from California, CNN projects, winning a special election for the remainder of Kamala Harris’ term as well as an election for a full six-year term. Padilla, the son of Mexican immigrant parents, was appointed by California Gov. Gavin Newsom to the seat Harris vacated when she became vice president.
CA-SOS: Democrat Shirley Weber will be California’s first elected Black secretary of state of state, CNN projects. Weber, a former state assemblywoman, has been serving in the position since last year after Newsom picked her to succeed Padilla, who was appointed to the US Senate.
CA-AG: Democrat Rob Bonta will be California’s first elected Filipino American attorney general, CNN projects. Bonta, who was born in the Philippines and immigrated with his family to the US as an infant, has been serving in the position since last year after Newsom appointed him to succeed Xavier Becerra, who left to become President Joe Biden’s Health and Human Services secretary.
CA-42: Democrat Robert Garcia will be the first out LGBTQ immigrant elected to Congress, CNN projects, winning election to California’s 42nd Congressional District. Garcia, who immigrated from Lima, Peru, in the early 1980s at the age of 5, is the current mayor of Long Beach.
Los Angeles Mayor: Democrat Karen Bass will be the first woman and the first Black woman elected mayor of Los Angeles, CNN projects. Bass, who currently represents a Los Angeles-area House seat, will defeat real estate developer Rick Caruso. Bass was on Joe Biden’s short list for a running mate in the 2020 campaign. She’s no stranger to making history: She previously served in the California State Assembly, where in 2008 she became the first Black woman to serve as speaker of a state legislature.
Bass said on November 17, the day after her race was called, that the accomplishment of becoming the first female mayor of Los Angeles and the magnitude of the job was “sinking in.”
“To me, when you do make history, when you’re in a position like this – and I was in a similar position when I was sworn in as speaker – it means that you have extra responsibility. You always have to make sure that you maintain excellence in every step of the way,” she said. “The path that you go is laying the foundation for those that come behind you.”
Colorado
CO-08: Democrat Yadira Caraveo will be the first Latina elected to Congress from Colorado, CNN projects, winning the race for the state’s new 8th Congressional District. Caraveo, a state representative and the daughter of Mexican immigrant parents, will defeat Republican state Sen. Barbara Kirkmeyer to win the seat located north of Denver.
Connecticut
CT-SOS: Democrat Stephanie Thomas will be the first Black woman elected secretary of state of Connecticut, CNN projects. Thomas, a member of the Connecticut House, will succeed appointed Democratic incumbent Mark Kohler.
Florida

FL-10: Democrat Maxwell Frost will be the first member of Generation Z elected to Congress, CNN projects, winning the open seat for Florida’s 10th Congressional District. Generation Z refers to those born after 1996. Frost will succeed Democrat Val Demings, who vacated the seat to run for Senate.
The 25-year-old representative-elect told CNN’s Poppy Harlow on November 9 that when President Joe Biden called to congratulate him, the President recalled being too young to be sworn in as a senator when he was first elected at age 29.
“He asked me if it was the same situation. I said, ‘No, Mr. President, you had me beat on that. I’m already old enough to be sworn in on January 3.’ So, it was great to talk with him. You know, he was elected at a very young age, too, so he understands that experience,” Frost said on “CNN This Morning.”
Frost, who made reducing gun violence a central part of his campaign, also told CNN that he will work to pass universal background checks in Washington.
Illinois
IL-03: Democrat Delia Ramirez will be the first Latina elected to Congress from Illinois, CNN projects, winning election to the state’s redrawn 3rd Congressional District. Ramirez, a Chicago-area state representative and the daughter of Guatemalan immigrants, was also the first Guatemalan American to serve in the Illinois General Assembly.
IL-17: Democrat Eric Sorensen will be the first out gay person elected to Congress from Illinois, CNN projects, winning election to the state’s 17th Congressional District. Sorensen, a former Rockford and Quad Cities meteorologist, will defeat Republican Esther Joy King in the race to succeed retiring Democratic Rep. Cheri Bustos.
Maryland

Control of Senate and House still hang in the balance: It's too early to call key races — including in Nevada, Georgia, Wisconsin and Arizona — that could determine which party controls the chambers. Dozens of governorships, secretaries of states and attorneys general are also on the line.
First Senate flip of the night: Democrat John Fetterman will win Pennsylvania's Senate seat, CNN projects, and defeat Trump-backed Republican Mehmet Oz. The pick up is a big boost to Democrats' hopes of clinging to the Senate as the red wave that Republicans hoped for has yet to materialize in the House.

CNN Projection: Republican Sarah Huckabee Sanders will win Arkansas governorship 
From CNN staff 
(Andrew Harnik/AP)
Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the one-time press secretary and communications director for former President Donald Trump, will win Arkansas’ gubernatorial race, CNN projects. 
She will be the first woman elected governor of Arkansas. 
Huckabee Sanders defeated Democrat Chris Jones, who is a minister and former non-profit leader who got a degree in nuclear engineering from MIT. 
Arkansas last elected a Democratic governor in 2010 and it’s now a solidly red state. 
Sanders, while a first-time candidate, is no stranger to politics. Her father, Republican Mike Huckabee, was governor of Arkansas from 1996 to 2007. And by defeating Democrat Chris Jones, Sanders will also become the first daughter in US history to serve as governor of the same state her father once led. 
Sanders previously worked for two years in the George W. Bush administration and later ran her father’s 2008 campaign for the Republican presidential nomination and then was campaign manager for his 2016 bid. 
She gained national prominence in her role as former President Donald Trump’s White House press secretary, serving as a staunch defender of the then-President and his policies for more than two years. On many occasions, she clashed with national reporters and eventually scaled back televised briefings. She defended the move, saying that journalists could hear from Trump directly. 
Sanders earned an early endorsement from Trump after joining the race for Arkansas governor, and prominent rivals later dropped out of the race, clearing her path to the GOP nomination. 
Sanders’ path to victory in the race to succeed term-limited GOP Gov. Asa Hutchison was relatively smooth – unsurprising in a state that has taken a sharp turn to the right in recent years. But the campaign was not without personal challenges. In September, Sanders announced she was diagnosed with thyroid cancer and “underwent a successful surgery to remove my thyroid and surrounding lymph nodes.” 
In her race for governor, Sanders defended her decision to grant only a handful of interviews with local media, saying she’s been speaking to voters directly. 
“Freedom of the press is incredibly important, but with freedom of the press also comes a great deal of responsibility, and when they don’t live up to their end of the bargain, it forces some of us to go outside of the box, which I have done every single day for the last two years,” Sanders said at an October 21 debate hosted by the Arkansas PBS station. 
In the debate, Sanders highlighted key issues of her campaign, including her education plan, Arkansas LEARNS, to increase literacy rates, and her support for phasing out the state income tax, though she has not explicitly stated a timeline for doing so.

CNN Projection: Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer will win reelection in New York 
From CNN's Alex Rogers

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer will win reelection in New York, CNN projects, and defeat Republican Joe Pinion. 
Pinion briefly hosted a show on Newsmax and has worked as the director of a youth development at Morris Height Health Center in the Bronx. 
Schumer's victory will make him the longest-serving senator from New York after he’s sworn in next year. 
Over 48 years, Schumer has never lost a race, rising from the state Assembly to the House of Representatives to the pinnacle of power in the Senate. 
While seeking to keep Democratic control of the 50-50 Senate this year, Schumer continued his tradition of visiting the Empire State’s 62 counties, and his campaign built an overwhelming financial advantage over his Republican opponent, Joe Pinion, a former host and conservative commentator on Newsmax. 
Pinion tried to turn Schumer’s longevity into a weakness, blaming him for a poor economy and charging that it’s time to turn the page. 
“He is, in fact, an exceptional politician, one of the best that has ever lived,” said Pinion at a recent debate hosted by Spectrum News. “But he’s a failed senator. He has failed the people of this state on multiple occasions.” 
At the debate, Schumer touted the Senate’s past two years and boasted that “for the first time,” New York received more money from Washington than it sent. He then ticked off the major legislation passed by this Congress: granting Medicare the power to negotiate lower prices for some drugs, what he called “the most important climate change bill ever” and bipartisan gun safety and infrastructure bills. He also pledged to protect abortion rights after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. 
“In the last two years, under my leadership, the Senate has had the most productive session in decades,” said Schumer. 
The Brooklyn-bred New Yorker, the son of an exterminator and housewife, leaned into his Jewish background in one ad by teaching various Yiddish words -- calling Republican political leaders “schmos” and describing the “naches” he felt in passing the Inflation Reduction Act. 
“Fighting for New York is no shtick for me,” he added. 
 9:00 p.m. ET, November 8, 2022
It’s 9 p.m. ET. Polls are closing in Arizona, Texas, New York and 12 other states 
From CNN’s Ethan Cohen and Melissa Holzberg DePalo 
It’s 9 p.m. ET, and polls are closing in these states: 
Arizona 
Colorado 
Iowa 
Kansas 
Louisiana 
Michigan 
Minnesota 
Nebraska 
New Mexico 
New York 
North Dakota 
South Dakota 
Texas 
Wisconsin 
Wyoming 
Here’s what to know about the key races in Arizona: Republicans hope to take Arizona back after Democrats made inroads in the swing state in 2020 when President Biden won the state and Mark Kelly flipped a Senate seat for Democrats. 
However, the GOP isn’t putting up moderate Republicans to help that cause. Republican gubernatorial nominee Kari Lake and GOP Senate nominee Blake Masters were both endorsed by Trump and have expressed skepticism that Biden legitimately won the state. 
These are the key races in Michigan: All eyes in Michigan will be on the state’s gubernatorial race as Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer faces conservative commentator Tudor Dixon, who’s hoping her Trump endorsement will help turn the state back towards Republicans. 
The right to abortion will also be on the ballot. Democrats hope the issue will help boost turnout among their base voters. 
Voting and elections will also be key issues, as Michigan voters will decide on a ballot measure to expand access to the ballot, and elect a new secretary of state. Incumbent Democrat Jocelyn Benson faces Republican Kristina Karamo, who has backed Trump’s lies about the 2020 election. 
And these are the races playing out in Wisconsin: Wisconsin is one of the most closely divided states in the nation, and GOP Sen. Ron Johnson and Democratic Gov. Tony Evers both face highly competitive reelection campaigns. 
Johnson, who has a history of controversial statements about the pandemic and the Jan. 6 attack, is facing Democratic Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes, who at one point signaled support for removing police funding. 
Evers faces Republican businessman Tim Michels, who won Trump’s support in the primary by aggressively amplifying the former president’s 2020 election lies.

Exit polls: Pennsylvania voters are split over Fetterman’s health
From CNN's Tami Luhby
Voters in Pennsylvania are split over whether Democratic Senate candidate John Fetterman’s health is good enough to represent the state effectively, according to the preliminary results of the Pennsylvania exit poll conducted for CNN and other news networks by Edison Research.
Fetterman, Pennsylvania’s lieutenant governor, suffered a near-fatal stroke days before he won the May Democratic primary.
But a majority of voters said that Mehmet Oz, the Republican candidate for Senate, has not lived in the commonwealth long enough to represent it effectively. More than 4 in 10 said he had.
Oz has said he moved to Pennsylvania in late 2020 after living in New Jersey for decades.
Voters also split over which candidate’s views are too extreme with more than 4 in 10 picking Fetterman and the same share selecting Oz.
More than one-third of Pennsylvania voters said that they care most about whether a candidate shares their values and whether a candidate has honesty and integrity. About 2 in 10 said the most important quality is that a candidate cares about people like them. Fewer than one in 10 said having the right experience matters most.
Men and women who cast ballots split their support, with more than half of men voting for Oz and more than half of women voting for Fetterman. Among independent voters, who made up about a quarter of the electorate, more than half voted for Fetterman.
For voters who thought that abortion was the most important issue, more than three quarters supported Fetterman. They made up just over one-third of the electorate.
But among those who said inflation was the most pressing issue, more than three-quarters cast ballots for Oz. They made up more than a quarter of the electorate.

Pennsylvania's Allegheny County receives final batch of mail-in and absentee ballots
From CNN’s Brian Todd and Dugald McConnell
At the Allegheny County Elections warehouse in Pennsylvania, they’re about to get the final mail-in and absentee ballots that were dropped off personally by voters. 
The last ones which were sent by mail were just dropped off here. There were 3,058 of those, the county spokesperson told CNN. 
A total of 156,000 mail-ins/absentee votes — which had already been sent in — were processed at the warehouse earlier today. 
Now that polls have closed, they will assign all those votes to candidates. 
Rich Fitzgerald, executive of Allegheny County, said that Democrats Josh Shapiro, candidate for governor, and John Fetterman, candidate for Senate, have out-performed Joe Biden in the mail-in and absentee voting in Allegheny County. 
In 2010 Biden got about 80% of the mail-in and absentee voting in Allegheny, Fitzgerald said.
Shapiro won 89% of that vote tonight and Fetterman won about 85% of it in the Senate race, he said.
Fitzgerald said he expects the Allegheny vote count, overall, to be done quickly tonight.

After Hillary lost, she went for a walk in the woods, wrote books, did podcasts & traveled the world advocating for human rights & democracy at large.
She didn’t once call for the Constitution to be terminated.

But do go on about how women are “too emotional to lead” won’t you.

These candidates are projected to win their race — and they are also making history
From CNN's Andrew Menezes
The race for control of Congress, as well as governorships and key statewide positions, has defined the 2022 midterms.
Heading into Election Day, in addition to taking control of chambers of Congress, both parties were also looking to diversify their ranks of elected officials, both at the Capitol and beyond. Republicans were excited about growing their roster of female governors and electing more Latino members to the US House. Democrats eyed expanding the number of Black US senators and making a breakthrough for LGBTQ representation in governor's offices. Both parties also sought to welcome their first members of Congress from Generation Z — those born after 1996. 
Election results are still coming in, and many races won't be called for days, if not weeks. But for now, here's a look at the candidates who CNN projects will make history in the 2022 midterms. 
Alabama Republican Katie Britt will be the first elected female senator from Alabama, CNN projects, winning an open-seat race to succeed her onetime boss, retiring GOP Sen. Richard Shelby. Britt is a former CEO of the Business Council of Alabama and was the heavy favorite in the general election in the deep-red state. Two women have previously represented Alabama in the Senate, but both were appointed to fill vacancies. 
Florida Democrat Maxwell Frost will be the first member of Generation Z elected to Congress, CNN projects, winning the open seat for Florida's 10th Congressional District. Generation Z refers to those born after 1996. Frost will succeed Democrat Val Demings, who vacated the seat to run for Senate. 
Oklahoma Republican Markwayne Mullin will be the first Native American senator from Oklahoma in almost 100 years, CNN projects, winning the special election to succeed GOP Sen. Jim Inhofe, who is resigning in January. Mullin, a member of the Cherokee Nation, currently represents the state's 2nd Congressional District. Democrat Robert Owen, also a member of the Cherokee Nation, represented Oklahoma in the Senate from 1907 to 1925.

WATCH LIVE: CNN's special coverage of midterm election results
2022 midterm election results
By Aditi Sangal, Adrienne Vogt, Elise Hammond, Maureen Chowdhury, Clare Foran, Meg Wagner, Melissa Macaya, Joe Ruiz and Seán Federico-OMurchú, CNN
Updated 5:55 a.m. ET, November 9, 2022
What we covered here
Control of Senate and House still hang in the balance: It's too early to call key races — including in Nevada, Georgia, Wisconsin and Arizona — that could determine which party controls the chambers. Dozens of governorships, secretaries of states and attorneys general are also on the line.
First Senate flip of the night: Democrat John Fetterman will win Pennsylvania's Senate seat, CNN projects, and defeat Trump-backed Republican Mehmet Oz. The pick up is a big boost to Democrats' hopes of clinging to the Senate as the red wave that Republicans hoped for has yet to materialize in the House.
Historic firsts: Both parties are diversifying their ranks. Here's a look at the candidates CNN projects will make history.

CNN Projection: Republican Katie Britt will win Alabama’s Senate race
From CNN's Alex Rogers

Republican Katie Britt will win Alabama’s Senate race, CNN projects, and defeat Democrat Will Boyd, the pastor of the St. Mark Missionary Baptist Church.
It's the first time the state has elected a woman to the office. 
Britt is the former chief of staff for retired Sen. Richard Shelby. The drama in this race came in the Republican primary when Britt took on Rep. Mo Brooks. Trump initially endorsed Brooks, but he rescinded the endorsement as Brooks’ campaign struggled.
Democrats last won a Senate seat in Alabama in 2017 when Doug Jones won a special election against Republican Roy Moore.
Britt’s chances in crimson red Alabama were never in doubt -- the competitive race was for the Republican nomination to succeed the retiring Republican Sen. Richard Shelby. 
Britt jumped into the primary race even though Alabama Rep. Mo Brooks had already earned former President Donald Trump’s endorsement. 
But Brooks – who led the charge in Congress to overturn the 2020 election results – was viewed as an unreliable ally to the business community, especially compared to Shelby, who delivered federal funding for the state for decades. And Britt, Shelby’s former chief of staff and the Business Council of Alabama’s former CEO, had deep ties to that wing of the party. 
Meanwhile, a self-funded Republican candidate, Lynda Blanchard, the former Trump ambassador to Slovenia, never took off and dropped out of the race. Army veteran pilot Mike Durant -- of “Black Hawk Down” fame -- was weighed down by his sister’s public claims that he was in denial about her allegations of sexual abuse involving their father, which Durant strongly denied. 
And Britt was able to flip Trump. At a Super Bowl party, New England Patriots coach Bill Belichick praised Britt—and her husband Wesley, a former Patriot—to Trump. That sparked an invitation to Trump’s Palm Beach estate. 
Britt had already cast herself as a Trump-aligned conservative, arguing that Brooks was a career politician, who had heavily criticized Trump during the 2016 GOP presidential primary. In March, after Brooks publicly accused Trump of asking him to break the law by exploring ways to reinstall him as commander in chief, Trump dropped the congressman. 
In the May primary, Britt received 45% of the vote, but since no candidate received over 50%, the race turned to a June runoff election. Trump then endorsed Britt, who beat Brooks with 63% of the vote.

CNN Projection: Rep. Markwayne Mullin will become first Native American Oklahoma senator in nearly a century 
From CNN’s Paul LeBlanc

Republican Rep. Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma will win a special election for US Senate, CNN projects, making him the first Native American to represent Oklahoma in the chamber in nearly a century. 
Mullin, who currently represents the deeply conservative 2nd Congressional District, will defeat Democratic nominee Kendra Horn, a former congresswoman, in the race for the seat of GOP Sen. Jim Inhofe, who is resigning in January. 
A citizen of the Cherokee Nation, Mullin was first elected to his House seat in eastern Oklahoma in 2012 and went on to closely align himself with former President Donald Trump. 
He voted in 2021 to object to the congressional certification of now-President Joe Biden’s Electoral College wins in Pennsylvania and Arizona. Mullin tweeted at the time that he was objecting “due to all the fraud and uncertainty,” though there has been no evidence of fraud even close to widespread enough to have changed the outcome. Two days prior to the vote, he told constituents that he “absolutely” did not think the election was honest. 
But Mullin sought to anchor his Senate campaign in more broad Republican positions, listing “RESTORE Law and Order” and “FIGHT the Liberal Biden Agenda” as priorities on his campaign website. 
“I’m running to keep this seat RED, fight for our conservative values in the Senate, and Save America from Biden’s far left insanity,” his website reads. 
Less prominent in Mullin’s campaign messaging was that fact he was running to be the first Native American senator from Oklahoma since Robert Owen left Congress in 1925, though he did acknowledge the historic nature of his Senate bid during a speech in September. 
“I’m going to be the only true Native American in the Senate when I get elected,” Mullin told the National Tribal Health Conference in Washington, DC. “That’s crazy.” 
“How crazy that we’re true Native Americans, the first Americans,” he added, “and we’re so underrepresented in the halls of Congress.”

Republican Sen. James Lankford will win reelection in Oklahoma, CNN projects, and defeat Democrat Madison Horn. 
Lankford was first elected in 2014, when he won a special election to fill the remainder of former GOP Sen. Tom Coburn’s term. Horn is a Cherokee Nation tribal citizen and cybersecurity professional.

CNN Projection: Marco Rubio will defeat Val Demings in Florida Senate race
From CNN’s Steve Contorno

Florida voters will reelect Republican Sen. Marco Rubio to a third term over Democratic Rep. Val Demings, CNN projects, an outcome that is sure to harden arguments that the Sunshine State is no longer the purple battleground of yesteryear.
Rubio trailed in fundraising throughout the race and operated a low-key campaign with few public events and just one debate. But it was enough to defeat Demings in a state that has been trending red since the last midterm cycle, when another Senate contest was decided in a recount.
The race in Florida entered the election cycle as one to watch. The decision by Demings to challenge Rubio provided a much-needed shot in the arm to a Florida Democratic Party that has struggled to nominate strong candidates. As a Black woman and former Orlando police chief, Demings offered a counter to Republican narratives that Democrats were soft on crime. Demings also proved to be a formidable fundraiser, pulling in more money than Rubio every quarter she was in the race. 
But Demings’ background in law enforcement did not deter Rubio from running ads tying her to anti-law enforcement sentiments in her party, and he often touted the endorsement of most of the state’s elected sheriffs and its police unions. 
Republican voters now outnumber Democrats by more than 300,000 in Florida, a complete reversal from the last time Rubio appeared on the ballot. Under the state’s rightward lurch, Rubio embraced former President Donald Trump, his one-time rival, and he became an original cosponsor to a national 15-week abortion ban introduced by Sen. Lindsey Graham, even as Demings and Democrats tried to make the election a referendum on abortion access. 
Rubio’s victory comes six years after he nearly bowed out of politics following his failed presidential campaign. As Florida’s senior senator, he will resume his post as one of the Republican Party’s most influential voices on foreign policy at a time of growing tension around the globe over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, China’s rise as a world power and widespread economic unrest over inflation. 
The son of Cuban immigrants, Rubio was first elected to the US Senate in 2010 in a three-way race against Democrat Kendrick Meek and then-Gov. Charlie Crist, who ran as an independent. Rubio won reelection in 2016 over Democrat Patrick Murphy. Rubio previously served as a state lawmaker in Florida, where he rose to speaker of the state House.

Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey will win reelection, CNN projects, defeating Democrat Yolanda Flowers.

The Alabama governor did have to fend off a primary challenge from Lindy Blanchard, the former ambassador to Slovenia in the Trump administration, who criticized Ivey for issuing mask mandates to combat the Covid-19 pandemic.

CNN Projection: Ron DeSantis will win reelection as Florida governor 
From CNN’s Steve Contorno

Gov. Ron DeSantis, Florida’s hard-charging Republican leader who became a household name during the pandemic, will win a second term leading the Sunshine State, CNN projects, thwarting Democrat Charlie Crist’s attempt to take back his old job. 
With the campaign for reelection behind him, the focus of DeSantis’ political future will now turn to 2024. A decision is looming on whether he rides his political success in Florida into a national campaign for the White House, where he may find himself on a collision course with former President Donald Trump. 
On the campaign trail, DeSantis spent little time on Crist, instead focusing on President Joe Biden and his nationalized political battles. His campaign released a series of compelling, sharply produced videos and ads geared as much toward his growing national following on social media and email as Florida voters. In one labeled ""Top Gov,"" DeSantis, who served as a Navy lawyer, cosplayed as a fighter pilot as he shared his ""rules of engagement"" for ""dogfighting"" with the ""corporate media."" In another, his wife Casey DeSantis delivered an emotional account of her battle with breast cancer. His final ad suggested God created DeSantis to be a fighter. 
En route to his victory, DeSantis built an unprecedented cash advantage over Crist and his $31 million campaign. Half of the $200 million DeSantis raised came from donations of $50,000 or more, though he also received tens of thousands of small contributions from across the country. As of November 3, DeSantis had $66 million unused between his two political committees. Sources close to the governor's team previously told CNN that DeSantis' political operation had explored how to leverage leftover campaign money for a federal race. 
Crist struggled to gain traction after winning the primary against state Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried in late August. His campaign was further hampered by the September arrival of Hurricane Ian, which brought the race to a screeching halt and postponed a planned rally and fundraiser with Biden and the race's only scheduled debate. Biden did Crist no favors when he complimented DeSantis' handling of Ian during a joint appearance in Fort Myers Beach. 
Crist attempted to make DeSantis' known political aspirations into an issue in the race. During their only debate, Crist challenged DeSantis to vow to serve a full four-year term if reelected as governor. DeSantis declined. In a canned line he appeared to read off a paper, DeSantis said of his future political ambitions: ""The only worn-out, old donkey I'm looking to put out to pasture is Charlie Crist."" 
In a second term, DeSantis has promised to eliminate permits to carry firearms and further ""expand pro-life protections,"" though he has not outlined what those might be. 
DeSantis was first elected to the US House in 2012. He was reelected twice, though he resigned his third term early after securing the Republican nomination for governor in 2018. DeSantis defeated a more establishment-backed candidate in that primary on the back of an endorsement from Trump.

It’s 8 p.m. ET. Polls are closing in Pennsylvania, Florida and 14 other states
From CNN’s Ethan Cohen and Melissa Holzberg DePalo 
It’s 8 p.m. ET, and polls are closing in the following states: 
Alabama 
Connecticut 
Delaware 
Florida 
Illinois 
Maine 
Maryland 
Massachusetts 
Mississippi 
Missouri 
New Hampshire 
New Jersey 
Oklahoma 
Pennsylvania 
Rhode Island 
Tennessee 
Polls are also closing in some House districts in Kansas, Michigan and Texas. 
One thing to note: Polls in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania, will stay open until 10 p.m. ET, according to an order from Judge Lesa S. Gelb. Attorneys petitioning for the extension of time cited a paper shortage at polling locations that ultimately resulted in the inability to print paper ballots and necessitated the use of emergency and provisional ballots, resulting in delays for voters. 
Here’s what to know about the key races happening in Pennsylvania: The state that put President Biden over the top in 2020 is home to some of the most important Senate and gubernatorial races in the country. 
Republicans are hoping to hold on to an open Senate seat with former TV personality Mehmet Oz, while Lt. Gov. John Fetterman is hoping his nontraditional appeal can help him move the seat into the Democrats’ column. 
State Attorney General Josh Shapiro is trying to maintain Democratic control of Pennsylvania’s governorship in a race that has taken on added importance because the governor appoints the official responsible for elections. Shapiro’s opponent is Republican state Sen. Doug Mastriano, who was a central figure supporting Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election.

Exit polls: Warnock loses some support among Black and Hispanic Georgians
From CNN's Tami Luhby
Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock of Georgia who is locked in tight reelection race with Republican Herschel Walker, lost some support among Black and Hispanic voters in Tuesday’s closely watched election, compared with the special runoff election the Democrat won in 2021, according to the preliminary national results of the exit poll conducted for CNN and other news networks by Edison Research.
The votes in Georgia continue to be counted, but the race is widely expected to be close.
Roughly 9 in 10 Black voters and nearly 6 in 10 Hispanic voters in Georgia supported Warnock, but he lost several percentage points among each group, the preliminary exit polls found.
Warnock also shed a few percentage points of support among men who cast ballots and among voters age 64 and younger. However, the senator gained a small amount of support among White voters, who make up nearly two-thirds of the electorate, and among senior citizens.
Still, Walker was the candidate of choice among more than two-thirds of White voters, as well as among a majority of men who cast ballots.
A majority of women who voted and around 8 in 10 non-White voters opted for Warnock.
More than half of voters age 45 and older cast ballots for Walker, while nearly 6 in 10 younger voters selected Warnock.

CNN Projection: Ron DeSantis will win reelection as Florida governor

Gov. Ron DeSantis, Florida’s hard-charging Republican leader who became a household name during the pandemic, will win a second term leading the Sunshine State, CNN projects, thwarting Democrat Charlie Crist’s attempt to take back his old job. 
With the campaign for reelection behind him, the focus of DeSantis’ political future will now turn to 2024. A decision is looming on whether he rides his political success in Florida into a national campaign for the White House, where he may find himself on a collision course with former President Donald Trump. 
On the campaign trail, DeSantis spent little time on Crist, instead focusing on President Joe Biden and his nationalized political battles. His campaign released a series of compelling, sharply produced videos and ads geared as much toward his growing national following on social media and email as Florida voters. In one labeled ""Top Gov,"" DeSantis, who served as a Navy lawyer, cosplayed as a fighter pilot as he shared his ""rules of engagement"" for ""dogfighting"" with the ""corporate media."" In another, his wife Casey DeSantis delivered an emotional account of her battle with breast cancer. His final ad suggested God created DeSantis to be a fighter. 
En route to his victory, DeSantis built an unprecedented cash advantage over Crist and his $31 million campaign. Half of the $200 million DeSantis raised came from donations of $50,000 or more, though he also received tens of thousands of small contributions from across the country. As of November 3, DeSantis had $66 million unused between his two political committees. Sources close to the governor's team previously told CNN that DeSantis' political operation had explored how to leverage leftover campaign money for a federal race. 
Crist struggled to gain traction after winning the primary against state Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried in late August. His campaign was further hampered by the September arrival of Hurricane Ian, which brought the race to a screeching halt and postponed a planned rally and fundraiser with Biden and the race's only scheduled debate. Biden did Crist no favors when he complimented DeSantis' handling of Ian during a joint appearance in Fort Myers Beach. 
Crist attempted to make DeSantis' known political aspirations into an issue in the race. During their only debate, Crist challenged DeSantis to vow to serve a full four-year term if reelected as governor. DeSantis declined. In a canned line he appeared to read off a paper, DeSantis said of his future political ambitions: ""The only worn-out, old donkey I'm looking to put out to pasture is Charlie Crist."" 
In a second term, DeSantis has promised to eliminate permits to carry firearms and further ""expand pro-life protections,"" though he has not outlined what those might be. 
DeSantis was first elected to the US House in 2012. He was reelected twice, though he resigned his third term early after securing the Republican nomination for governor in 2018. DeSantis defeated a more establishment-backed candidate in that primary on the back of an endorsement from Trump.

It’s 8 p.m. ET. Polls are closing in Pennsylvania, Florida and 14 other states
From CNN’s Ethan Cohen and Melissa Holzberg DePalo 
It’s 8 p.m. ET, and polls are closing in the following states: 
Alabama 
Connecticut 
Delaware 
Florida 
Illinois 
Maine 
Maryland 
Massachusetts 
Mississippi 
Missouri 
New Hampshire 
New Jersey 
Oklahoma 
Pennsylvania 
Rhode Island 
Tennessee 
Polls are also closing in some House districts in Kansas, Michigan and Texas. 
One thing to note: Polls in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania, will stay open until 10 p.m. ET, according to an order from Judge Lesa S. Gelb. Attorneys petitioning for the extension of time cited a paper shortage at polling locations that ultimately resulted in the inability to print paper ballots and necessitated the use of emergency and provisional ballots, resulting in delays for voters. 
Here’s what to know about the key races happening in Pennsylvania: The state that put President Biden over the top in 2020 is home to some of the most important Senate and gubernatorial races in the country. 
Republicans are hoping to hold on to an open Senate seat with former TV personality Mehmet Oz, while Lt. Gov. John Fetterman is hoping his nontraditional appeal can help him move the seat into the Democrats’ column. 
State Attorney General Josh Shapiro is trying to maintain Democratic control of Pennsylvania’s governorship in a race that has taken on added importance because the governor appoints the official responsible for elections. Shapiro’s opponent is Republican state Sen. Doug Mastriano, who was a central figure supporting Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election.

Exit polls: Warnock loses some support among Black and Hispanic Georgians
From CNN's Tami Luhby
Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock of Georgia who is locked in tight reelection race with Republican Herschel Walker, lost some support among Black and Hispanic voters in Tuesday’s closely watched election, compared with the special runoff election the Democrat won in 2021, according to the preliminary national results of the exit poll conducted for CNN and other news networks by Edison Research.
The votes in Georgia continue to be counted, but the race is widely expected to be close.
Roughly 9 in 10 Black voters and nearly 6 in 10 Hispanic voters in Georgia supported Warnock, but he lost several percentage points among each group, the preliminary exit polls found.
Warnock also shed a few percentage points of support among men who cast ballots and among voters age 64 and younger. However, the senator gained a small amount of support among White voters, who make up nearly two-thirds of the electorate, and among senior citizens.
Still, Walker was the candidate of choice among more than two-thirds of White voters, as well as among a majority of men who cast ballots.
A majority of women who voted and around 8 in 10 non-White voters opted for Warnock.
More than half of voters age 45 and older cast ballots for Walker, while nearly 6 in 10 younger voters selected Warnock.

Exit polls: Ohio voters think the economy is weak
From CNN's Tami Luhby
More than three-quarters of Ohio voters said the nation’s economy was “poor” or “not so good,” according to the preliminary results of the Ohio Exit Poll conducted for CNN and other news networks by Edison Research.
And nearly three-quarters of Buckeye State voters said inflation has caused their family severe or moderate hardship, with nearly 2 in 10 saying their difficulties were severe.
More than half of those who cast ballots said that President Joe Biden’s policies are hurting, while about one-third said they are helping.
The president is not that popular among Ohio voters – more than half disapprove of him, with more than 4 in 10 approving.

Milwaukee elections official says city expects overall turnout of 70-75% registered voters
From CNN's Zachary Cohen and Casey Tolan 
The top election official for the city of Milwaukee told reporters Tuesday evening that she expects an overall turnout of 70-75% of registered voters from that area of the state. 
Claire Woodall-Vogg, executive director of the City of Milwaukee Election Commission, told reporters that this is close to the same level of turnout as what was seen in 2018 and the number of absentee ballots will likely be lower than what was initially expected. 
Milwaukee is one of 38 municipalities in Wisconsin that processes its absentee ballots at a “central count,” or a single location, according to the Wisconsin Elections Commission.
In Milwaukee and other central count cities, absentee votes are reported only after they are all counted, while elsewhere in the state, absentee and in-person votes are generally counted and reported at the same time. 
As of Tuesday morning, more than 60,000 voters in Milwaukee had returned absentee ballots, more than in any other municipality in the state. 
Woodall-Vogg said election workers at the Milwaukee central count are still on track to finish tallying the city’s absentee ballots by 10 p.m. or 11 p.m. CT on Tuesday night.
7:56 p.m. ET, November 8, 2022
Analysis: Early numbers suggest some Georgia voters did not vote for the same party across key races
Based on early voting tallies coming in on two key races in Georgia, some voters are voting for one party's candidate in the Senate race, but then choosing another party's candidate in the gubernatorial race.
For example, Democratic nominee and Sen. Raphael Warnock has more actual votes than Democratic candidate for governor Stacey Abrams on the same ticket.
Early results show Warnock with about 80,000 more votes than Abrams, ""meaning people are voting for Raphael Warnock, and then not voting for Abrams,"" CNN's John King explained, adding that some of those votes are going to Republican incumbent Gov. Brian Kemp.
This is visible specifically in Democratic-leaning Fulton County, which includes Atlanta, where GOP nominee Herschel Walker has fewer than 65,000 votes while Republican incumbent Gov. Brian Kemp has received about 79,000 votes so far.
The early numbers show ""Herschel Walker underperforming the governor,"" King said in his analysis.

Here's how candidates in Wisconsin’s tight Senate race spent Election Day
From CNN's Omar Jimenez
Mandela Barnes, left, and US Sen. Ron Johnson (AP)
Wisconsin Senator Ron Johnson spent Election Day in Oshkosh with his family after casting his ballot at the Oshkosh Town Hall with his wife, his campaign told CNN.
The Republican also spent time with his grandchildren and dialed into some GOTV radio hits and teletown halls with supporters. 
For his part, Democratic challenger Mandela Barnes spent the day in the Democratic stronghold of Milwaukee, hopping from college campus to college campus to greet students at Milwaukee Area Technical College, UW-Milwaukee, and Marquette University.
He tweeted: “students at Marquette are fired up and ready to send Ron Johnson packing. So inspired by all of y’all and your determination to be the change you seek.”
If elected, Barnes would be the nation’s second-youngest senator — older only than Georgia Sen. Jon Ossoff.

What we covered here
Control of Senate and House still hang in the balance: It's too early to call key races — including in Nevada, Georgia, Wisconsin and Arizona — that could determine which party controls the chambers. Dozens of governorships, secretaries of states and attorneys general are also on the line.
First Senate flip of the night: Democrat John Fetterman will win Pennsylvania's Senate seat, CNN projects, and defeat Trump-backed Republican Mehmet Oz. The pick up is a big boost to Democrats' hopes of clinging to the Senate as the red wave that Republicans hoped for has yet to materialize in the House.
Historic firsts: Both parties are diversifying their ranks. Here's a look at the candidates CNN projects will make history.

A man can be in the worst position and all he will say is “I’ll take care of it”

He might be flat broke with no hope, but that’s what he will say.

And might get grumpy but somehow he always finds a way.

Respect to all the real men out there that do the impossible daily.

The pick up is a big boost to Democrats' hopes of clinging to the Senate as the red wave that Republicans hoped for has yet to materialize in the House.
Historic firsts: Both parties are diversifying their ranks. Here's a look at the candidates CNN projects will make history.

From recreational marijuana to voting initiatives, here are the latest decisions on key ballot measures

Voters around the country weighed in on key ballot measures on Tuesday, including initiatives that require IDs to vote and others that would legalize recreational marijuana.
Here's what we know so far:
Marijuana
Arkansas voters reject recreational marijuana ballot initiative: Arkansas voters on Tuesday rejected a constitutional amendment that would have allowed cannabis possession and recreational consumption by adults as well as the sale by licensed facilities, CNN projects. Had it passed, cannabis possession of up to an ounce would have been legal and some tax revenue from marijuana sales would have contributed to funding law enforcement.
Maryland legalizes recreational marijuana with ballot measure: Maryland voters on Tuesday approved a constitutional amendment that legalizes recreational marijuana for people 21 and older. It will go into effect on July 1, 2023, and allow possession of 1.5 ounces or two plants. Possession of small amounts of marijuana was already decriminalized in Maryland. Under the amendment, those previously convicted of cannabis possession and intent to distribute will be able to apply for record expungement. 
Voters end prohibitions on marijuana in Missouri: Missouri voters on Tuesday approved a constitutional amendment that ends prohibitions on marijuana in the state and allows personal use for those or those over the age of 21, CNN projects. It will allow personal possession up to 3 ounces. Additionally, the amendment allows individuals with marijuana-related non-violent offenses to petition for release from prison or parole and probation and have their records expunged. The amendment, which will be enacted 30 days after the election, prohibits marijuana facilities from selling cannabis-infused products shaped or packaged as candy that may be attractive to children. 
North Dakota voters reject ballot measure to legalize recreational marijuana: A citizen-initiated ballot measure that aimed to allow the use of marijuana in ""various forms"" for those who are at least 21 years-old was rejected by North Dakota voters, CNN projects. It would have allowed marijuana possession of up to an ounce and all marijuana is to be tested in a facility ""for the potency of products and the presence of pesticides"" and subject to random inspection. Legalization was on the ballot in four other states this November. 
South Dakota voters reject proposal to legalize recreational marijuana: Voters in South Dakota rejected a ballot measure that aimed to legalize marijuana for recreational use in the state, CNN projects. Marijuana legalization previously passed in 2020, but South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem’s office championed efforts to nullify the legalization saying that it violated the state’s constitution. The Republican governor’s office previously indicated to CNN that the 2022 measure appears to be written constitutionally and she would have implemented it if it passed. 
Voting
Nebraska voters approve measure to require ID to cast ballot: Nebraska voters have approved an initiative that would amend the state constitution to require that voters present a valid photo identification in a way that is specified by the legislature, CNN projects. To pass, “yes” needed to win a majority and votes equal to at least 35% of total votes cast in the election. 
Connecticut passes ballot measure to allow early voting: Connecticut voters have approved a measure that would amend the state constitution to permit the legislature to enact early voting, CNN projects.

Here are some key takeaways from Election Night — and where things stand now 
From CNN's Eric Bradner, Dan Merica and Gregory Krieg
The battle for control of Congress – both the House and the Senate – is coming down to a dwindling number of key races, with Democrats dashing Republicans’ hopes for a red wave and both parties hanging onto hopes of winning narrow majorities.
Republicans began the night with a rout in Florida, where Gov. Ron DeSantis won heavily Latino, historically Democratic regions on his way to a blowout victory that could serve as a launch pad for a 2024 presidential run.
But in the hours that have followed, Democrats have fought back. In Pennsylvania, Democratic Lt. Gov. John Fetterman defeated Republican Mehmet Oz for the seat of retiring Republican Sen. Pat Toomey.
Meanwhile, the battle for the House majority – one that favored Republicans, who expected to benefit from high inflation, historical trends and friendly new district lines after 2021’s redistricting – remains unsettled.
Here are some key takeaways as votes continue to be counted in key races:
Democrats go a long way to protecting their Senate majority: Republicans were not shy about the importance of Pennsylvania’s Senate race: “This is a must-win race. We believe if we win Pennsylvania, we win the majority,” said Steven Law, president of the preeminent Republican Senate super PAC. Early on Wednesday morning, CNN projected that Fetterman would be the next senator from Pennsylvania, defeating Oz in the most expensive and high stakes Senate campaign in the country. Fetterman’s win was a thunderclap for Democrats.
Democrats and the suburbs: Suburban areas across the country went a long way to helping Democrats avoid a significant red wave. Republicans may still win the House, but if the 2022 election was going to be a red wave, it was likely to come through suburban victories that have not materialized yet. Republicans did score some suburban victories – CNN projected Brandon Ogles the winner in a district around Nashville, Tom Kean Jr. winning in a suburban New Jersey district and Rich McCormick the victor in a district that included Atlanta’s northern suburbs – but it was their defeats that spoke volumes about the size of the GOP wave.
Virginia’s split decision offers early signals: Three Democratic-controlled House races in Virginia were widely viewed as an early warning signal of the night’s results. Democrats held seats in two Virginia districts Biden won in 2020. CNN projected that Democratic Jennifer Wexton won her reelection bid in Virginia’s 10th District. In an even more competitive race, CNN projected Rep. Abigail Spanberger also won reelection in Virginia’s 7th District. But Democrats lost in southeastern Virginia, with CNN projecting that Republican state Sen. Jen Kiggans defeated Democratic Rep. Elaine Luria.
Another Jan. 6 committee member loses: Luria, a member of the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, lost her Virginia Beach-based House seat, CNN projected. She had defeated former GOP Rep. Scott Taylor in 2018 and 2020. But the district had become slightly more favorable ground for Republicans in redistricting: Biden carried the previous version by 5 points, and would have lost the new district by 2 points.
DeSantis and 2024: Gov. Ron DeSantis led a dominant Republican ticket in Florida – delivering historic margins in Democratic territory in his victory over Democratic Rep. Charlie Crist on a night that provides him a powerful argument if he seeks the GOP’s 2024 presidential nomination. The easy wins by DeSantis, who led by nearly 20 percentage points with 92% of the estimated vote counted, and Sen. Marco Rubio, who was 17 points up, were enough to cast doubt on Florida’s status as a national bellwether.
GOP makes gains with Latinos in Florida: Republicans hoped to build on Trump’s inroads among Latino voters in 2020, a trend that could reshape the political landscapes in several swing states if it continues. The strongest early signal that the GOP had continued to make gains came in Miami-Dade County, home to a large Cuban population. But it’ll take a while to fully gauge whether those GOP gains take place outside of Florida.
Win for abortion rights: In Michigan, Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer – who staked her reelection campaign on her successful efforts to block the enforcement of the state’s 1931 law banning abortion in almost all instances – defeated Republican challenger Tudor Dixon, who had waged a campaign focused on cultural battles. Michigan voters also approved a Whitmer-backed amendment to the state’s constitution that will scrap that 1931 law and guarantee abortion rights. Voters in California and Vermont also green-lit constitutional amendments enshrining abortion rights.
A night of firsts: Up and down the ballot, in red states and blue, candidates from both parties are celebrating pathbreaking victories. Read about some of them here.

Maricopa County will post additional results on Wednesday night
From CNN’s Tara Subramaniam

 Election Day ballots from all 223 sites in Maricopa County, the most populous county in Arizona, have been reported as of 1:55 a.m local time, according to a tweet from the county’s elections department.
Additional results are expected to be posted Wednesday night, the county said.
As of 1:59 a.m. local time, with 90% of statewide precincts reporting, the Democratic candidates for the senate, governor and secretary of state were in the lead.
Earlier in the day, Maricopa County experienced technical problems with tabulation devices at about 20% of its voting locations, county officials said Tuesday morning, but there was no indication of intentional malfeasance despite claims to the contrary.

Multiple vehement election deniers will lose their gubernatorial races, CNN projects
From CNN's Daniel Dale 
Some of the most aggressive deniers of the 2020 election results will lose their 2022 gubernatorial races, CNN projects.
CNN found that at least 22 of the 36 Republican candidates for governor have rejected, declined to affirm, raised doubts about, or tried to overturn President Joe Biden’s victory.
Here are some of the candidates CNN projects will lose:
Doug Mastriano of Pennsylvania, who made extensive efforts to try to overturn Biden’s win. (As governor, Mastriano would have had the power to appoint the state elections chief.)
Dan Cox of Maryland, who said he didn’t recognize Biden as the president and who co-organized buses to the “Stop the Steal” rally on January 6, 2021.
Paul LePage of Maine, who falsely claimed that 2020 was “clearly a stolen election.”
Lee Zeldin of New York, who, as a member of Congress, voted against certifying Biden’s victories in Pennsylvania and Arizona.
Geoff Diehl of Massachusetts, who said in mid-2021 that the election wasn’t stolen but by 2022 was saying that it was certainly stolen.
Scott Jensen of Minnesota, who refused to affirm the legitimacy of Biden’s win and who baselessly suggested imprisoning the state’s Democratic elections chief. 
Tim Michels of Wisconsin, who baselessly claimed that “President Trump probably would be president right now if we had election integrity.”
Tudor Dixon of Michigan, who falsely claimed Trump won Michigan in 2020 even though he actually lost by more than 154,000 votes. 
Heidi Ganahl of Colorado, who refused on multiple occasions to say whether Biden was the legitimate winner and then selected a promoter of false election conspiracy theories as her running mate.
Some incumbents who denied or questioned the election results will win, CNN projects. They include:
Kay Ivey of Alabama, who ran an ad during her Republican primary that falsely claimed the 2020 election was stolen from Trump.
Brad Little of Idaho, who endorsed the Texas-led lawsuit in 2020 that sought to get the Supreme Court to overturn Biden’s win.
Kim Reynolds of Iowa, who expressed support for that Texas-led lawsuit (though she later said Biden was legitimately elected).
Greg Abbott of Texas, who also expressed support for the lawsuit led by the attorney general of his state. 
Kristi Noem of South Dakota, who baselessly claimed on Twitter that Trump was fighting “rigged election systems” and hinted that there were issues in “Democrat-run” states.

Democratic Rep. Chris Pappas will win reelection in New Hampshire’s 1st Congressional District, CNN projects, keeping the swing seat in Democratic hands by defeating Karoline Leavitt, who worked as a press aide to former President Donald Trump.

In pictures: The 2022 midterm elections
A line of early voters stretches outside the City Services Center in Columbus, Georgia, on November 26. Georgia will host a Senate runoff election on Tuesday, December 6, between Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock and Republican Senate nominee Herschel Walker. Cheney Orr/Reuters
Updated 12:58 PM EST, Mon December 5, 2022
Republicans won control of the House of Representatives in this year's midterm elections, while the Democrats held onto the Senate.
A runoff Tuesday in Georgia will determine whether the Democrats will have 51 seats or 50. US Sen. Raphael Warnock is defending his seat against Republican challenger Herschel Walker.
While the loss of the House will hurt President Joe Biden's domestic agenda, it was far from the ""red wave"" that many experts had predicted.
Dozens of governorships, secretaries of states and attorneys general were also on the ballot this November.

CNN projected that Moore would be the winner in his race against Dan Cox. That makes Moore the first Black governor in Maryland's history. It also makes him just the third Black American to be elected governor in US history, after Virginia's Douglas Wilder, who was elected to a term in 1989, and Massachusetts' Deval Patrick, who was first elected in 2006 and served two terms.

After Hillary lost, she went for a walk in the woods, wrote books, did podcasts & traveled the world advocating for human rights & democracy at large.
She didn’t once call for the Constitution to be terminated.

But do go on about how women are “too emotional to lead” won’t you.

Updated 5:55 a.m. ET, November 9, 2022
What we covered here
Control of Senate and House still hang in the balance: It's too early to call key races — including in Nevada, Georgia, Wisconsin and Arizona — that could determine which party controls the chambers. Dozens of governorships, secretaries of states and attorneys general are also on the line.
First Senate flip of the night: Democrat John Fetterman will win Pennsylvania's Senate seat, CNN projects, and defeat Trump-backed Republican Mehmet Oz. The pick up is a big boost to Democrats' hopes of clinging to the Senate as the red wave that Republicans hoped for has yet to materialize in the House.
Historic firsts: Both parties are diversifying their ranks. Here's a look at the candidates CNN projects will make history.

As polls begin to close, here are some terms to know while you follow along during election night
From CNN's Zachary B. Wolf and Ethan Cohen

Whether you’re the most hardened of political junkies or you only tune in every other November to vote, it’s always a good idea to brush up on some of the terms you will hear on election night.
What is the balance of power? Political parties have more power when they control the House or Senate by winning a majority of the seats in that chamber. The party in power controls committees that write legislation and decides which measures will get a vote on the floor. In the House, the party with at least 218 seats has the majority and, assuming it can unite behind one candidate, selects the Speaker of the House. In the Senate, the party with 51 votes has the majority.
What is a “flipped seat” or “pickup”? A flipped seat or pickup is one in the House or Senate that voters take from one party and entrust to the other party. Because of redistricting, nine House seats – including seven new seats where there is no incumbent and two where two incumbents are running against each other – cannot be classified as pickups for either party.
What is an “incumbent?” An incumbent is a lawmaker or elected official running for reelection.
What is a special election? When a senator retires, dies or leaves office before his or her term ends, the state’s governor usually appoints a placeholder to fill the seat. Then there’s often a chance for voters to have their say, usually at the next possible federal election. That’s how Democratic Sens. Mark Kelly of Arizona and Raphael Warnock of Georgia were first elected in 2020 in special elections and why in 2022 both men are running for a full six-year term.
This year, there are special Senate elections in Oklahoma, where Republican Sen. James Inhofe will be resigning next year, and in California, where Democratic Sen. Alex Padilla, who was appointed to replace Vice President Kamala Harris, is running both to fill the remainder of Harris’ term (which ends in January) and to win the next term.
House members cannot be appointed, so when a House seat becomes vacant there needs to be a special election to fill it. This year, there’s a special election in Indiana to serve the last couple months of Rep. Jackie Walorski’s term. Walorski died in August.
What is ranked-choice voting? A number of cities and states are experimenting with ways to give voters more access to the political process and to potentially depolarize politics. Ranked-choice voting is a system in place for most elections in Maine and Alaska where voters rank their choices in order of preference instead of picking a single candidate. If no candidate gets more than 50% of the first-place votes, the bottom candidate is dropped and the second choice of the voters who selected that candidate gets those votes. That process repeats until a winner emerges.
What does “estimated vote” mean? Based on data including turnout in previous elections, pre-election ballots cast or requested, and pre-election polling, organizations can anticipate how many votes are expected in a given election. An estimated vote can under- or overestimate the actual vote, and the percentage reporting may move up or down throughout Election Night depending on how those estimates are adjusted as analysts assess real-time data. As those estimates solidify, they can be useful in predicting how many votes remain to be counted.
What are exit polls? Exit polls are large-scale polls conducted by a consortium of news organizations among early and absentee voters and voters on Election Day. They are conducted as voters leave polling stations, on Election Day and in many states at early voting locations, and also by telephone or online ahead of Election Day to account for mail-in and early voting.
What does “down ballot” mean? The top of the ticket is the race that the largest number of people in a state will see on their ballot. In a presidential year, those candidates are at the top of the ticket. Candidates in more local races are down ballot. A candidate for the House, for example, is down ballot from a presidential candidate. A mayoral candidate is down ballot from a House candidate.
What is a ballot initiative? How does a state decide to put one on the ballot? While most laws are passed by state legislatures or Congress, many states put some questions directly to voters during elections. These can range from issues like marijuana legalization to abortion or tax measures. The ballot initiatives give voters a more active role in choosing the direction of their laws.
What is a CNN “key race”? Who decides that? “Key race” is a subjective term. Most politics watchers generally agree that only a subset of races is truly competitive in November, and these are generally considered the key races. Political parties spend more money on these races. Reporters spend more time covering them.
Of the 35 Senate races on the ballot in 2022, the election forecasters at Inside Elections consider three to be true toss-ups and another four to tilt toward either Republicans or Democrats. Nineteen House races are true toss-ups, although many more could wind up being closely contested. Five governor races are toss-ups. See the Inside Elections ratings for Senate, House and governor. Key races can also be races that might be less competitive but have broader implications or feature especially notable candidates.

Ohio election officials work to quash disinformation in real time
From CNN's Melanie Zanona 
Ohio election officials are working to swat down disinformation about polling places and election machines that have been circulating on social media. 
Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose called out a post claiming that voting machines were breaking down at a polling place and a sheriff had to be called as false. The secretary of state tweeted that all machines “are working properly” and that a sheriff was called because of “an isolated instance of an individual harassing a poll worker. The situation has been peacefully resolved.” 
The Cuyahoga County Board of Elections pushed back on a viral tweet alleging that there were last-minute changes made to polling locations in Ohio. The county board of elections said this tweet is false, and all locations were confirmed two months ago.
Election officials have been actively preparing for potential disinformation and conspiracy theories about the election to spread online, and they have set up rapid response teams to spot and debunk falsehoods in real time.

Officials in Pennsylvania's Allegheny County say in-person turnout is high
From CNN's Brian Todd

Officials in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania — the county seat of Pittsburgh — say there is high in-person voter turnout, as well as a signifiant mail-in and absentee vote count.
A county spokesperson, referring to absentee/mail-in ballots, told CNN that ""employees continue to extract ballots from the secrecy envelopes and are flattening those ballots for scanning. Over 130,000 ballots have been scanned so far.”
That means more than three-fourths of the mail-in/absentee ballots that were filed in the county have been scanned so far. But they won’t be officially assigned to candidates until after the polls close. 
Officials in Allegheny County also say of the more than 1,000 absentee/mail-in ballots that were incorrectly dated and in danger of not being counted, only about 160 people have come into the county office to ""cure,"" or correct, those faulty ballots. People have until polls close at 8 p.m. ET to cure their wrongly dated ballots. 
CNN spoke to one voter who mis-dated her ballot who said she was thinking about her daughter’s wedding next year and was so preoccupied with that, that she put the wrong date on there. That’s the kind of simple mistake many people are making.

Adviser insists the midterms won't have an impact on Biden's decision on whether to run again
From CNN's Phil Mattingly

President Joe Biden’s top advisers acknowledge the outcome of the midterm elections will likely reshape Washington – and by extension, how the White House operates.
But on one specific issue, a senior adviser insisted the impact would be negligible: Biden’s looming decision on whether to run for reelection. 
The adviser noted that Biden’s two Democratic predecessors suffered midterm wipeouts, only to go on to win reelection two years later. 
But beyond that, the adviser framed it as far more about how Biden views the moment in the country and his ability to keep making progress on the issues he’s pushed to enact in his first two years in office. 
Biden, of course, has said he plans to run, but no final decision has been made. He is expected to start critical meetings with family members and close advisers in the coming weeks.

6 polling locations across Georgia have been ordered by courts to remain open after polls close 
From CNN's Jason Morris
Six precincts across Georgia have been ordered by courts to remain open past 7 p.m. ET, according to Gabriel Sterling, Georgia’s acting deputy secretary of state.
Sterling said two polling locations in Cobb County in Atlanta’s northern suburbs have been ordered to stay open until 7:45 p.m., two locations in DeKalb County in the Atlanta area have been ordered to stay open until 7:40 p.m. and 7:49 p.m., and two precincts in other counties will stay open until shortly after 7 p.m., when polls are scheduled to close. 
Sterling said that there are more than 2,600 poll locations in Georgia, and the hours were extended at these six locations because they opened late this morning. 
Sterling said that “steady turnout around the state” has continued, and there have not been any major voting issues in Georgia so far. Election Day has been “wonderfully, stupendously boring,” Sterling said during a news conference Tuesday afternoon. 
Sterling said that 2.5 million people cast ballots during early voting and they had 234,000 absentee ballots as of Monday.

With no evidence, Trump floats the possibility of mass voter fraud in the midterms
From CNN's Daniel Dale
Former President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly and falsely alleged that there was mass voter fraud in the 2020 election, baselessly suggested on social media on Tuesday that such fraud might be happening in the 2022 midterms.
""Same thing is happening with Voter Fraud as happened in 2020???"" Trump wrote Tuesday afternoon on his Truth Social platform.
There was no evidence of widespread or outcome-changing voter fraud in the 2020 election, and there was no early sign on Tuesday of any significant voter fraud in the 2022 midterms. Voter fraud typically represents a tiny fraction of ballots cast in US elections.
Trump made his claim amid a series of social media posts in which he complained about assorted technical difficulties in some states. There was no evidence that any of these issues involved intentional malfeasance, let alone “voter fraud.”

Exit polls: Republican and Democratic voters differ in their top issues
From CNN's Ariel Edwards-Levy
There’s a significant partisan divide in voters’ priorities and attitudes this year, according to the preliminary national results of the exit poll conducted for CNN and other news networks by Edison Research.
Nearly half of voters who supported a GOP House candidate called inflation their top issue, with fewer than 15% picking any other issue as their priority. Among voters who backed a Democratic candidate, about 44% called abortion their top issue, with 15% or fewer picking any other issue.
Meanwhile, midterm voters were mostly opposed to the US Supreme Court decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, according to the preliminary national exit polls.
Slightly fewer than 4 in 10 said they felt enthusiastic or satisfied about the decision, while about 21% said they felt dissatisfied, and roughly 4 in 10 that they were angry.
About 60% of all voters said that abortion should be legal in most or all cases, up from 51% among voters who turned out for the 2020 general election.

Voters encounter long lines in Texas’ Harris County as technical issues cause delays at some locations
From CNN's Jason Hanna
Voters in Texas’ Harris County, which includes Houston, waited in long lines at some polling places Tuesday morning, in part because of technical issues that either delayed some sites’ openings or reduced the number of available voting machines. 
That included lines of up to two hours at a large Houston voting center, the Metropolitan Multi-Service Center on West Gray Street, CNN affiliate KHOU reported. Twenty of the site’s 60 machines were not operating at one point, though all were working by mid-morning, according to KHOU.
“We’re getting reports that some of our judges have had a little trouble opening their polling locations this morning,” though the process was “smoothing out a little bit,” Harris County Elections Administrator Clifford Tatum told reporters late Tuesday morning.
“There’s a process as it relates to opening the voting machines and getting them set up properly, and sometimes if the proper steps aren’t followed, then it may cause a couple of machines to go down. And our response is to send a technician out to those locations to get those machines back up online,” Tatum said.
One polling location couldn’t open on time because a supplier did not deliver a key to open the machine, he said.
Tatum urged voters to shift to a nearby polling site if the one they visited had long lines. Harris County residents can vote at any of the county’s 782 polling places.
Calls and emails to Tatum’s office for comment weren’t immediately returned.
Harris County, Texas’ most populous, has more than 2.5 million registered voters. The county had more than 750,000 voters during early voting, and Tatum said he was “hoping to see at least 500,000” voters Tuesday.

 — 
Wall Street is waiting for the results of Tuesday’s midterm election like the rest of the world, but traders say this week’s inflation report may prove to be far more consequential to markets.
“Obviously this midterm election — because democracy is on the ballot — is a big deal in the eyes of the population,” Peter Tuchman, a veteran New York Stock Exchange floor trader, told CNN Business on Tuesday. “But how much it weighs on the economy is a good question.”
Markets have rallied in recent days as investors bet Republicans will take control of at least one chamber, leading to divided government. Traders typically believe gridlock is good because it means one party can’t push through legislation that messes things up.
In this case, that means Republicans can’t enact unfunded tax cuts and Democrats can’t push through unfunded spending programs — both of which would worsen inflation that is already at decades-high levels, and lift interest rates.
“Less government, complete gridlock, will probably benefit the stock market,” said Tuchman.
Of course, gridlock may not prove to be good if it leads to a debt ceiling fight or if it limits the willingness of Congress to cushion the blow from a potential recession.
If Republicans win control of at least the House of Representatives, markets may have a “muted” reaction because that is widely expected, Goldman Sachs told clients in a report Monday.
Andrew Frankel, co-president of Stuart Frankel, agrees that a GOP victory is “baked in” and shouldn’t trigger a major market rally. If anything, Frankel said, it could be a sell-on-the-news event where markets retreat after getting confirmation of a GOP win.
Frankel warned that a surprisingly strong night for Democrats that allows them to retain control of both the House and Senate would cause a “meaningful move lower” for stocks.
Multiple NYSE traders told CNN that the midterm election may be overshadowed by Thursday’s Consumer Price Index, an inflation gauge that has become arguably the most important economic metric of the month.
“That CPI number is where all eyes are. It’s way more important than what happens today,” said Tuchman.
A hotter-than-expected inflation reading could reignite fears about massive interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve.
“Markets can adapt to virtually anything except unknowns,” Tuchman said. “The largest long-term unknown in the market is the inflation story.”

Democratic pick up in Pennsylvania boosts their hopes of holding Senate

 — 
Democrats will pick up a GOP-held Senate seat in Pennsylvania in a huge boost to their hopes of clinging to the chamber, while the red wave that Republicans hoped for has yet to materialize in the House.
Democratic nominee John Fetterman’s victory over Republican Mehmet Oz means Democrats have some slight breathing room in their bid to keep control of the 50-50 chamber as counting goes on in other key races in Arizona, Nevada, Georgia and Wisconsin.
Takeaways from the 2022 midterm elections
Republicans went into the night needing a net gain of one seat in the chamber to take control. They must now hold on to Wisconsin and win two out of three Democrat-held seats in Arizona, Nevada and Georgia to win the majority.
The Democratic win in Pennsylvania – the rare swing state where President Joe Biden hit the trail this fall – is also a rebuke of former President Donald Trump, who had endorsed Oz ahead of the primary and also appeared in the commonwealth in the final weekend of the campaign.
Senate Republicans fell short in New Hampshire and Colorado, where Democratic Sens. Maggie Hassan and Michael Bennet will win reelection, CNN projects.
Democrats also fell short in two Senate states that had proven surprisingly competitive heading into Election Day. Republicans will hold onto North Carolina and Ohio, CNN projects, denying Democrats opportunities to pick up seats that could have mitigated any future losses.
How to tell if the GOP is heading for a landslide in the House
Republicans had hoped to sweep a trio of Virginia districts on their way to a landslide. They will pick up one in a bellwether district with Republican Jen Kiggans’ defeat of Democratic Rep. Elaine Luria, the only member of the select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, insurrection who was facing a competitive general election.
Luria had put the fight to save American democracy at the center of her closing message but she fell short in a district that got slightly better for Republicans in redistricting. The race was among the most closely watched in the country – viewed as an early indicator of Republican strength on Tuesday night.
But in another key Virginia district, Democratic Rep. Abigail Spanberger will hold on to her seat, CNN projects, in a district that became bluer in redistricting. And in Michigan, Rep. Elissa Slotkin, another Democrat who came to the House in 2018’s blue wave, will win another term, CNN projected early Wednesday.
The 10 Senate seats most likely to flip in 2022
Elsewhere in the House, the GOP has made slower-than-expected gains, while Democrats have also picked up several seats. New Jersey Republican Tom Kean Jr., the son of a popular former governor, will defeat Democratic Rep. Tom Malinowski in a seat that got worse for Democrats, while Democrats will knock off GOP Rep. Steve Chabot, a perennial target, in an Ohio district that became much more favorable to them.
Some of the most aggressive deniers of the 2020 election results will lose their 2022 gubernatorial races, CNN projects.
That includes Pennsylvania’s Doug Mastriano, who will fall to rising star Democrat Josh Shapiro, and Michigan’s Tudor Dixon, who falsely claimed Trump won Michigan in 2020 and will fall to Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer.
A guide to the election deniers in midterm races
The fate of several Trump-backed candidates who echoed his lies about the 2020 presidential election was still unclear as ballots were being counted in Arizona and Nevada, but Arizona gubernatorial nominee Kari Lake had already raised unfounded doubts about the vote – in a clear echo of some conservatives’ repeated attempts to cast doubt on Maricopa’s results in 2020.
Several secretary of state candidates – including Republican Rayla Campbell of Massachusetts, Kim Crockett of Minnesota, Audrey Trujillo of New Mexico, H. Brooke Paige of Vermont and Kristina Karamo of Michigan – all lost their bids. Before the election, CNN tracked at least a dozen Republican nominees for secretary of state who denied the legitimacy of the 2020 election.
Voting goes mostly smoothly on Election Day as baseless fraud claims swirl
In Georgia, Republican Gov. Brian Kemp will defeat Democrat Stacey Abrams, CNN projects, in their rematch. Kemp had been targeted by Trump during the primary because he refused to overturn the 2020 presidential results. But Kemp largely ignored those attacks and ran on his record as a conservative who had helped the state’s economy recover after the Covid-19 pandemic. His strategy may offer a template for other Republicans who have crossed Trump.
In Florida, two early calls underscored GOP strength in the state. Sen. Marco Rubio will be reelected, CNN projects, defeating Democratic Rep. Val Demings. And Gov. Ron DeSantis, a potential challenger to ex-President Donald Trump in the Republican presidential primary in 2024, will win reelection in a victory that will supercharge his national ambitions.
Meet the history-makers of the 2022 midterm elections
And in Alabama, Republican Katie Britt, who was backed by Trump, will easily win the seat being vacated by retiring GOP Sen. Richard Shelby, becoming the first elected female senator from the state. In another history-making race, CNN projects that Arkansas Republican Sarah Huckabee Sanders, Trump’s former White House press secretary, will become the state’s first female governor, a post that was once held by her father, former GOP presidential candidate Mike Huckabee.
History was also made in blue states. In Massachusetts, Maura Healey will become the state’s first elected female governor and the nation’s first out lesbian governor, CNN projects. And Democrat Wes Moore will serve as Maryland’s first Black governor.
Early exit polls revealed a nation in the grip of economic pessimism. Roughly three-quarters of voters felt negatively about the economy with about 4 in 10 deeming it downright poor, according to the preliminary national results of the exit poll conducted for CNN and other news networks by Edison Research. A third of the electorate said inflation was the most important issue to their vote while about 27% cited abortion – the issue Democrats hoped could give them a boost after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade.
Republicans have already promised to launch investigations into the administration and cripple its agenda if they win the House majority, and many of their nominees have echoed Trump’s election falsehoods, leading to Biden’s repeated warnings about threats to democracy.
Appearing in Ohio on Monday night for Vance, the former president said he’d be making a big announcement at his Mar-a-Lago resort on November 15. CNN had previously reported his aides were eyeing the third week of November for a campaign launch – timing that would allow Trump to take credit for GOP successes in the midterms.
Ahead of a potential rematch with Trump, Biden’s dragging approval ratings had made him an unwelcome presence on the campaign trail in swing states. He spent election eve rallying in Maryland for Moore and in New York several days earlier for Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul.
A divided government in Washington could allow Biden to wield his presidential veto to frustrate Republican plans of prolonging Trump-era tax cuts and any attempt to pass a national ban on abortion. But it could also trigger fiscal showdowns and the threats of government shutdowns. A clash could also be looming over raising the debt ceiling.

NASA’s Artemis I mission delayed again as storm barrels toward launch site

Hurricane warning issued for eastern Florida as Tropical Storm Nicole strengthens

 — 
The Artemis I mission, which is expected to send an uncrewed spacecraft on a test mission around the moon, is delayed yet again, as NASA’s Space Launch System faces Tropical Storm Nicole, which is now expected to strengthen into a hurricane before it slams into Florida’s East Coast.
The space agency had been targeting November 14 for the third launch attempt but is now looking at November 16, “pending safe conditions for employees to return to work, as well as inspections after the storm has passed,” NASA said in a statement Tuesday evening. November 16 would offer a two-hour launch window that opens at 1:04 a.m. ET.
The rocket, often referred to as SLS, is sitting on its launchpad at Kennedy Space Center, which lies just to the north of where the storm’s center is expected to make landfall, CNN meteorologist Brandon Miller noted. That will mean the area can expect some of the strongest winds the system will bring.
If it is a 75-mile-per-hour (120-kph) Category 1 hurricane, as it’s predicted to be, gusts could range between 80 and 90 miles per hour (130 to 145 kph), according to Miller. That could mean the rocket will get battered by winds higher than the predetermined limits of what the rocket can withstand. Officials have said that SLS is designed to withstand gusts of up to 85 miles per hour (137 kph).
“Further, the National Weather Service in Melbourne, Florida, has forecasted max wind gusts occurring early Thursday morning of 86 miles per hour,” Miller added. “So yes, this is absolutely possible that wind gusts exceed that threshold.”
The National Hurricane Center’s latest report also gives a 15% chance that Cocoa Beach, which lies about 20 miles (32 kilometers) south of the launch site, will endure sustained hurricane-force winds.
Officials at NASA, however, said in a statement “forecasts predict the greatest risks at the pad are high winds that are not expected to exceed the SLS design.”
“The rocket is designed to withstand heavy rains at the launch pad and the spacecraft hatches have been secured to prevent water intrusion,” the statement continues.

The space agency decided to roll the SLS rocket out to its launchpad last week, as the storm was still an unnamed system brewing off the East Coast. At the time, officials had been expecting this storm to bring in sustained winds of around 25 knots (29 miles per hour) with gusts of up to 40 knots (46 miles per hour), which was deemed to be well within the predetermined limits of what the rocket can withstand, according to comments from Mark Burger, a launch weather officer with the US Space Force’s 45th Weather Squadron, at a NASA news conference on November 3.
“The National Hurricane Center just has a 30% chance of it becoming a named storm,” Burger said last Thursday. “However, that being said, the models are very consistent on developing some sort of a low pressure.”
The NASA Space Launch System rocket, with the Orion spacecraft aboard, is seen on November 6 Kennedy Space Center in Florida.

But the storm did grow into a named system on Monday, three days after the rocket was rolled out to the launchpad.
The storm’s strength is unusual, as Nicole is expected to be the first hurricane to strike the United States in November in nearly 40 years.
To prepare for the storm, NASA said its teams have powered down the Orion spacecraft, which sits atop the SLS rocket, as well as the rocket’s side boosters and other components.
“Engineers have also installed a hard cover over the launch abort system window, retracted and secured the crew access arm on the mobile launcher and configured the settings for the environmental control system on the spacecraft and rocket elements,” according to the statement. “Teams also are securing nearby hardware and performing walkdowns for potential debris in the area.”
Kennedy Space Center announced on its Twitter feed Tuesday that it is “in a HURICON III status and continues to prep for the upcoming storm taking prudent precautions across all of our programs, activities, and workforce in advance of the storm.”
The HURICON III preparations include “securing facilities, property and equipment” as well as deploying a rideout team, which is a staff that will be on site to assess any damages.
NASA sets date for another try at Artemis I launch
The SLS rocket had been stowed away for weeks after issues with fuel leaks thwarted the first two launch attempts and then Hurricane Ian rolled through Florida, forcing the rocket to vacate the launchpad in September.
Officials at NASA returned the rocket to the launchpad last week with the goal of working toward a third launch attempt on November 14. It’s not clear how or if the storm could impact those plans.
The overall goal of NASA’s Artemis program is to return humans to the moon for the first time in half a century. And the Artemis I mission — expected to be the first of many — will lay the groundwork, testing the rocket and spacecraft and all their subsystems to ensure they are safe enough for astronauts to fly to the moon and back.

Decent wrap up, biased.
The host does a good job of hitting the big ticket news you’d want to be aware of but it’s definitely not an objective look. Useful if you want a left perspective without having to bear pod-save America or TYT.

Please Please stop with the “sort of”
Mostly every adjective pronounced in this podcast is preceded by “sort of”. This implies that nothing is factual, precise, real. Is this what the host wants to convey?

In pictures: The 2022 midterm elections
A line of early voters stretches outside the City Services Center in Columbus, Georgia, on November 26. Georgia will host a Senate runoff election on Tuesday, December 6, between Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock and Republican Senate nominee Herschel Walker. Cheney Orr/Reuters
Updated 12:58 PM EST, Mon December 5, 2022
Republicans won control of the House of Representatives in this year's midterm elections, while the Democrats held onto the Senate.
A runoff Tuesday in Georgia will determine whether the Democrats will have 51 seats or 50. US Sen. Raphael Warnock is defending his seat against Republican challenger Herschel Walker.
While the loss of the House will hurt President Joe Biden's domestic agenda, it was far from the ""red wave"" that many experts had predicted.
Dozens of governorships, secretaries of states and attorneys general were also on the ballot this November.

President Joe Biden speaks to the media during a news conference at the White House. ""We had an election yesterday,"" Biden said on November 9. ""And it was a good day, I think, for democracy."" He said that ""while the press and the pundits are predicting a giant red wave, it didn't happen."" Tom Brenner/Reuters

Wes Moore, the Democratic Party's gubernatorial candidate in Maryland, rehearses a speech with his son, Jamie, as they wait for Election Day results in Baltimore. CNN projected that Moore would be the winner in his race against Dan Cox. That makes Moore the first Black governor in Maryland's history. It also makes him just the third Black American to be elected governor in US history, after Virginia's Douglas Wilder, who was elected to a term in 1989, and Massachusetts' Deval Patrick, who was first elected in 2006 and served two terms.

J.D. Vance, a Republican who CNN projected would win the open Senate seat in Ohio, speaks at an election night party in Columbus.

A man who flaunted private jets and luxury cars on Instagram gets 11 years in prison for money laundering
By Faith Karimi and Larry Madowo, CNN
Updated 9:55 PM EST, Tue November 8, 2022
Ramon Abbas, seen here in an image from his now-deleted Instagram account, financed his extravagant lifestyle through online hacking schemes that netted more than $24 million.
Department of Justice
CNN
 — 
A Nigerian social media influencer who flaunted a lavish lifestyle of private jets and luxury cars has been sentenced to 11 years in prison over charges related to a multimillion dollar scam that targeted companies in the United States and overseas.
Ramon Abbas, known to his millions of Instagram followers as Ray Hushpuppi, pleaded guilty in April last year to conspiracy to engage in money laundering. In addition to the prison sentence handed down on Monday, United States District Judge Otis D. Wright II ordered him to pay $1.7 million in restitution to two fraud victims.
It is a spectacular downfall for Abbas, 40, whose June 2020 arrest at his gilded perch in Dubai made headlines worldwide. Before his sentencing, Abbas was held in federal detention in Los Angeles, his once flamboyant social media account gone quiet — despite gaining 500,000 new followers since his arrest.
In a handwritten letter to the judge in September – the only direct word from him since his arrest – Abbas detailed his two years in detention.
The three page-long letter addressed the charges against Abbas, and his remorse therefor
US Department of Justice
“Since I have been incarcerated, I have had enough time to reflect on the past and I regret letting greed ruin the good name of my family, my blessing and my name,” he wrote.
On social media, where Abbas had posted videos of himself tossing wads of cash like confetti, he referred to himself as a real estate developer. But federal investigators said he financed his extravagant lifestyle through online hacking schemes that netted more than $24 million.
Job scams are on the rise. Watch out for these red flags
His targets included a US law firm, a foreign bank and an unnamed British professional soccer club, among others, according to a federal sentencing memorandum from the US Attorney’s Office in the Central District of California.
“Money laundering and business email compromise scams are a massive international crime problem, and we will continue to work with our law enforcement and international partners to identify and prosecute those involved, wherever they may be,” said Martin Estrada, a United States attorney.
His letter to the judge detailed some scams
Abbas’ September letter to Judge Wright detailed how his co-conspirators reached out to him to pinpoint businesses to scam or request banking information to transfer fraudulently obtained funds.
His alleged cyber crimes involved jaw-dropping amounts of money.
Federal documents detailed how Abbas and a co-conspirator “fraudulently induced” a New York law firm to wire nearly $923,000 meant for a client’s real estate refinancing to a bank account they controlled. A paralegal at the firm received fraudulent wire instructions after sending an email to what appeared to be a legitimate bank email address but was later identified as a “spoofed” address.
In such a business email compromise scam, criminals mimic an email message or website to make their communication appear like it’s from a known source making a request such as a money transfer.
Ramon Abbas told his millions of Instagram followers that he worked in real estate.
Department of Justice
Abbas also confessed to a conspiracy to defraud a Qatari businessman of more than $1 million.
“The defendants allegedly faked the financing of a Qatari school by playing the roles of bank officials and creating a bogus website in a scheme that also bribed a foreign official to keep the elaborate pretense going after the victim was tipped off,” acting United States Attorney Tracy L. Wilkison said in a statement last year.
Since his arrest, Abbas said, he’s had time to reflect on his mistakes.
“Your honor, I make no excuse for my actions and I take full responsibility for what I’ve done,” he wrote in his letter. “If I could turn back the hand of time, I would make an entirely different decision and be more careful in the choices and friends I make.”
One of his co-conspirators pleaded guilty in November 2020 to one count of conspiracy to engage in money laundering. He is also serving 11 years in federal prison and has to pay more than $30 million in restitution.
His social media account was a treasure trove of information for investigators
Federal investigators have described Abbas as a prolific money launderer who leveraged his social media platform to gain notoriety and brag about his wealth.
A Nigerian national based in Dubai, Abbas made no secret of his opulent lifestyle. Before his arrest, he called himself the “Billionaire Gucci Master” on Snapchat.
“Started out my day having sushi down at Nobu in Monte Carlo, Monaco, then decided to book a helicopter to have … facials at the Christian Dior spa in Paris then ended my day having champagne in Gucci,” he wrote in a photo caption on Instagram in 2020.
Abbas flaunted his wealth conspicuously on Instagram.
Department of Justice
Photos of him posing with multiple models of Bentley, Ferrari, Mercedes Benz and Rolls-Royce cars included the hashtag #AllMine. Others showed him rubbing elbows with international sports stars and other celebrities.
In a 2020 affidavit, federal officials detailed how his social media accounts provided details needed to confirm his identity.
The registration and account security information associated with his Instagram profile, for example, included an email address and phone number. Federal officials accessed that information and were able to link the email and phone number to financial transactions and transfers with people the FBI believed were his co-conspirators.
The art world has a money laundering problem
Even Abbas’ Instagram birthday party photos helped the investigation.
One such post displayed a birthday cake topped with a Fendi logo and a miniature image of Abbas surrounded by tiny shopping bags. Investigators used that post to verify the date of birth he had used on a previous US visa application.
In June 2020, United Arab Emirates investigators swooped into Abbas’ apartment at the exclusive Palazzo Versace resort in Dubai, arrested him and handed him over to FBI agents.
Investigators at the scene seized nearly $41 million, 13 luxury cars worth $6.8 million and phone and computer evidence including the email addresses of nearly 2 million possible victims, Dubai Police said in a statement.
“Thank you, Lord, for the many blessings in my life. Continue to shame those waiting for me to be shamed,” Abbas captioned an Instagram picture of a Rolls-Royce just two weeks before his dramatic arrest.
The account has since been taken down.

2022 midterm election results
By Aditi Sangal, Adrienne Vogt, Elise Hammond, Maureen Chowdhury, Clare Foran, Meg Wagner, Melissa Macaya, Joe Ruiz and Seán Federico-OMurchú, CNN
Updated 5:55 a.m. ET, November 9, 2022
What we covered here
Control of Senate and House still hang in the balance: It's too early to call key races — including in Nevada, Georgia, Wisconsin and Arizona — that could determine which party controls the chambers. Dozens of governorships, secretaries of states and attorneys general are also on the line.
First Senate flip of the night: Democrat John Fetterman will win Pennsylvania's Senate seat, CNN projects, and defeat Trump-backed Republican Mehmet Oz. The pick up is a big boost to Democrats' hopes of clinging to the Senate as the red wave that Republicans hoped for has yet to materialize in the House.
Historic firsts: Both parties are diversifying their ranks. Here's a look at the candidates CNN projects will make history.

Right-wing internet quickly spreads video from Maricopa County, Arizona
From CNN's Donie O’Sullivan, Sarah Boxer and Caroll Alvarado
A video of an election official explaining a problem with vote tabulations outside a polling location in Maricopa County, Arizona, earlier Tuesday morning is spreading on social media, clocking up millions of views. The video, which was posted by a Republican activist, has already been viewed more than 2.5 million times on Twitter.
The clip is largely being amplified by right-wing personalities, some of whom are claiming — without evidence — that the machine issues are a sign of fraud. 
“We’ve anticipated legitimate mistakes and issues with election infrastructure being reframed as fraud,"" Kate Starbird, an associate professor at the University of Washington who studies the spread of disinformation, told CNN. 
The video shows an election worker in the Phoenix suburb of Anthem explaining a problem with tabulation machines rejecting ballots. 
Election officials quickly responded, saying they were working on the issue and that voters whose ballots were not being accepted by a tabulation machine could put their ballot in a secure box and they would be counted after the polls close. 
“No one is being disenfranchised. And none of this indicates any fraud or anything of that sort. This is a technical issue,” said Bill Gates, chairman of the county’s Board of Supervisors and a Republican himself. 
A county spokeswoman added that the poll worker in the viral video did what they were supposed to. “That poll worker at Anthem was doing their job, providing voters the information they need to participate in this election, and the options they have. He was calm and transparent,” said Megan Gilbertson of the county’s election department.

VP Harris stops at an LA restaurant with Democratic mayoral candidate Karen Bass on Election Day
From CNN's Jasmine Wright
(Pool)
Vice President Kamala Harris and second gentleman Doug Emhoff stopped at John O’Groats restaurant on Election Day, joining Los Angeles mayoral candidate Rep. Karen Bass to greet diners inside. 
“Today’s Election Day, so please do vote,” the vice president said to a table.
“Oh you voted, thank you for voting,” she said to another table.
At one point, when the vice president entered the second room of the restaurant, a woman stood up and pointed to an “I voted” sticker on her chest, prompting Harris to cheer.
“Remind everybody you know about the stakes,” Harris said. “Lots at stake.” 
Harris and Emhoff went around taking photos with diners, and Emhoff was overheard telling one diner to “get the pancakes.”
The vice president ordered two dozen biscuits, saying, “I am not playing around with biscuits” and joking that Emhoff could have only one. She got butter and jam on the side before going into the kitchen to thank the cooks.

Poll workers across Michigan are reporting higher voter turnout than expected, said Michigan Department of State spokesperson Jake Rollow. 
""We're just hearing from election workers across the state that they're pleasantly surprised by how many people are showing up to vote in person,"" he said. 
Rollow said he still expects all ballots will be counted by 8 p.m. local time on Wednesday, which is within 24 hours of polls closing. 
As of 11:30 a.m. local time today, 2,018,929 absentee ballots had been requested in Michigan, and 1,758,987 had been submitted, according to Rollow. As of 12:30 p.m. today, there were 3,666 same-day registrations across the state, he said.

2 Georgia poll workers removed after social media post show them at the US Capitol on Jan. 6

A mother and son were removed as poll workers in Johns Creek, Georgia, minutes before polls opened this morning, after a social media post surfaced showing them attending the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol. 
“I stood up for what’s right today in Washington DC. This election was a sham. Mike Pence is a traitor. I was tear gassed FOUR times. I have pepper spray in my throat. I stormed the Capitol building. And my children have had the best learning experience of their lives,” one Facebook post shared with CNN by state election officials read. 
“I am aware that it occurred. That really is a Fulton County internal issue. They have to mitigate the risk the way they see fit given that information,” said Gabriel Sterling, chief operating officer for the Georgia Secretary of State’s office, when asked about it by CNN’s Erin Burnett Tuesday. 
“I think it would have been better if they found out earlier potentially and worked with the people, but since it was so last minute and it came to light so late, I leave it to Fulton County. But yes, that did happen earlier this morning,” Sterling said. 
The social media post is under “investigation for concern,” Nadine Williams, Fulton County interim director of registration and elections, said at a press conference earlier on Tuesday. 
“We decided to remove them until we could complete the investigation,” Williams said. 
“We just want to make sure the election is secure,” she added. 
Social media posts and a comment made during a poll worker event was brought to the Fulton County board’s attention by a peer. Williams said the secretary of state’s office was consulted on the matter, and the state office agreed that there was a concern. 
Williams said she was not at liberty to comment on the nature of the social media post when asked by a reporter, but she confirmed that it included a threat about election security.
“There were some things in there that were not allowed. You cannot take videos or photos in the election. That’s what brought it to our attention,” Williams said.

These are the states where mail-in ballots must be received or postmarked by Election Day
In eight US states, voters are sent a mail-in ballot automatically. Across the US, more than half of states require that mail-in ballots be received by Election Day. In 19 states, ballots can be counted if they are postmarked on or before Election Day.

Analysis: Top Senate races in 2022 have seen a staggering amount of spending
Analysis from CNN's Chris Cillizza
The five most expensive Senate races of 2022 have seen nearly $1.3 billion in spending across the primary and general elections, according to OpenSecrets, a staggering sum that speaks to the massive amounts of money flooding the political system.
Leading the way is the Pennsylvania Senate race, where Democratic Lt. Gov. John Fetterman and Republican Dr. Mehmet Oz are squaring off in the general election. All told, nearly $375 million has been spent on the race this cycle, OpenSecrets found. 
Here's how the other races in the top five stack up in terms of total spending: 
Pennsylvania: $373,605,258
Georgia: $271,351,786 
Arizona: $234,577,515 
Wisconsin: $205,791,615
Ohio: $202,117,075 
Pennsylvania was also the most expensive Senate race of the 2016 cycle, when Republican Pat Toomey was running for reelection. Total spending in that race was around $179 million, according to OpenSecrets — less than half the amount spent on the 2022 contest.
What numbers like these suggest is that attempts — earlier this century — to lessen the impact of money in politics have failed utterly. There is more money than ever before, and it's difficult to track where some of the money, spent by nonprofit groups that aren't required to disclose their donors, comes from.

37% of active Georgia voters had cast their ballot early, election official says
From CNN's Aditi Sangal

Gabriel Sterling, chief operating offer for Georgia's secretary of state's office, says voter turnout across the Peach State has been ""steady,"" although it's hard to ""it's always difficult to know in the middle of the day how it's going.""
Majority of polling locations have no lines, with average wait time of about two minutes, he told CNN Tuesday. ""It's been a very efficient process.""
Sterling also pointed to the record number of absentee ballots received in Georgia. It stands at about 234,000 ballots as of this morning, which is up from 2018's record of 213,0000 ballots, he said, adding that it takes a lot of pressure off officials when they start counting.
""We set records for early vote turnout. Between early vote and absentee — and absentee set a new record as of this morning of 234,000 for a midterm. That really takes away pressure off Election Day, because ... when we start today, nearly 37% of all our active voters had already cast a ballot,"" he said.
Sterling said that new laws passed in Georgia clarified that early in-person votes and absentee votes can be tabulated early, ""which will hopefully get us some earlier returns in the 7:15, 7:45 and 8:00 hour from even some of our larger counties.""

After Hillary lost, she went for a walk in the woods, wrote books, did podcasts & traveled the world advocating for human rights & democracy at large.
She didn’t once call for the Constitution to be terminated.

But do go on about how women are “too emotional to lead” won’t you.

Election Day ""going smoothly"" in Wisconsin, state's voting chief says
From CNN's Casey Tolan and Zachary Cohen

Election Day voting in Wisconsin is going smoothly, without any significant problems, said Wisconsin’s top election official Tuesday.
“As of this afternoon, there are no major issues that have been reported,” Meagan Wolfe, the nonpartisan administrator of the Wisconsin Elections Commission, said at a press conference. “Election Day in Wisconsin is going smoothly.”
The commission had received some “very minor reports earlier today of lines at the polling places around the state,” as well as “routine calls and questions,” Wolfe added.
Polls in the state close at 8 p.m. central time, and those waiting in line at the time can still vote, Wolfe reminded voters. 
As of Tuesday morning, voters had requested about 815,000 absentee ballots and returned about 742,000 of them, including about 318,000 in-person absentee ballots, she noted.
Acknowledging that some jurisdictions could take until Wednesday morning to complete their tallies of absentee ballots, Wolfe said, “election officials are always going to value accuracy over speed.”
“There are observers in that same room until the very last ballot is counted,” Wolfe said. “There really is no part of the election administration process that’s done behind a locked door.”

Poll workers across Michigan are reporting higher voter turnout than expected, said Michigan Department of State spokesperson Jake Rollow. 
""We're just hearing from election workers across the state that they're pleasantly surprised by how many people are showing up to vote in person,"" he said. 
Rollow said he still expects all ballots will be counted by 8 p.m. local time on Wednesday, which is within 24 hours of polls closing. 
As of 11:30 a.m. local time today, 2,018,929 absentee ballots had been requested in Michigan, and 1,758,987 had been submitted, according to Rollow. As of 12:30 p.m. today, there were 3,666 same-day registrations across the state, he said.

2 Georgia poll workers removed after social media post show them at the US Capitol on Jan. 6

A mother and son were removed as poll workers in Johns Creek, Georgia, minutes before polls opened this morning, after a social media post surfaced showing them attending the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol. 
“I stood up for what’s right today in Washington DC. This election was a sham. Mike Pence is a traitor. I was tear gassed FOUR times. I have pepper spray in my throat. I stormed the Capitol building. And my children have had the best learning experience of their lives,” one Facebook post shared with CNN by state election officials read. 
“I am aware that it occurred. That really is a Fulton County internal issue. They have to mitigate the risk the way they see fit given that information,” said Gabriel Sterling, chief operating officer for the Georgia Secretary of State’s office, when asked about it by CNN’s Erin Burnett Tuesday. 
“I think it would have been better if they found out earlier potentially and worked with the people, but since it was so last minute and it came to light so late, I leave it to Fulton County. But yes, that did happen earlier this morning,” Sterling said. 
The social media post is under “investigation for concern,” Nadine Williams, Fulton County interim director of registration and elections, said at a press conference earlier on Tuesday. 
“We decided to remove them until we could complete the investigation,” Williams said. 
“We just want to make sure the election is secure,” she added. 
Social media posts and a comment made during a poll worker event was brought to the Fulton County board’s attention by a peer. Williams said the secretary of state’s office was consulted on the matter, and the state office agreed that there was a concern. 
Williams said she was not at liberty to comment on the nature of the social media post when asked by a reporter, but she confirmed that it included a threat about election security.
“There were some things in there that were not allowed. You cannot take videos or photos in the election. That’s what brought it to our attention,” Williams said.

Analysis: Top Senate races in 2022 have seen a staggering amount of spending
Analysis from CNN's Chris Cillizza
The five most expensive Senate races of 2022 have seen nearly $1.3 billion in spending across the primary and general elections, according to OpenSecrets, a staggering sum that speaks to the massive amounts of money flooding the political system.
Leading the way is the Pennsylvania Senate race, where Democratic Lt. Gov. John Fetterman and Republican Dr. Mehmet Oz are squaring off in the general election. All told, nearly $375 million has been spent on the race this cycle, OpenSecrets found. 
Here's how the other races in the top five stack up in terms of total spending: 
Pennsylvania: $373,605,258
Georgia: $271,351,786 
Arizona: $234,577,515 
Wisconsin: $205,791,615
Ohio: $202,117,075 
Pennsylvania was also the most expensive Senate race of the 2016 cycle, when Republican Pat Toomey was running for reelection. Total spending in that race was around $179 million, according to OpenSecrets — less than half the amount spent on the 2022 contest.
What numbers like these suggest is that attempts — earlier this century — to lessen the impact of money in politics have failed utterly. There is more money than ever before, and it's difficult to track where some of the money, spent by nonprofit groups that aren't required to disclose their donors, comes from.

37% of active Georgia voters had cast their ballot early, election official says
From CNN's Aditi Sangal

Gabriel Sterling, chief operating offer for Georgia's secretary of state's office, says voter turnout across the Peach State has been ""steady,"" although it's hard to ""it's always difficult to know in the middle of the day how it's going.""
Majority of polling locations have no lines, with average wait time of about two minutes, he told CNN Tuesday. ""It's been a very efficient process.""
Sterling also pointed to the record number of absentee ballots received in Georgia. It stands at about 234,000 ballots as of this morning, which is up from 2018's record of 213,0000 ballots, he said, adding that it takes a lot of pressure off officials when they start counting.
""We set records for early vote turnout. Between early vote and absentee — and absentee set a new record as of this morning of 234,000 for a midterm. That really takes away pressure off Election Day, because ... when we start today, nearly 37% of all our active voters had already cast a ballot,"" he said.
Sterling said that new laws passed in Georgia clarified that early in-person votes and absentee votes can be tabulated early, ""which will hopefully get us some earlier returns in the 7:15, 7:45 and 8:00 hour from even some of our larger counties.""

What we covered here
Control of Senate and House still hang in the balance: It's too early to call key races — including in Nevada, Georgia, Wisconsin and Arizona — that could determine which party controls the chambers. Dozens of governorships, secretaries of states and attorneys general are also on the line.
First Senate flip of the night: Democrat John Fetterman will win Pennsylvania's Senate seat, CNN projects, and defeat Trump-backed Republican Mehmet Oz. The pick up is a big boost to Democrats' hopes of clinging to the Senate as the red wave that Republicans hoped for has yet to materialize in the House.
Historic firsts: Both parties are diversifying their ranks. Here's a look at the candidates CNN projects will make history.

From recreational marijuana to voting initiatives, here are the latest decisions on key ballot measures

Voters around the country weighed in on key ballot measures on Tuesday, including initiatives that require IDs to vote and others that would legalize recreational marijuana.
Here's what we know so far:
Marijuana
Arkansas voters reject recreational marijuana ballot initiative: Arkansas voters on Tuesday rejected a constitutional amendment that would have allowed cannabis possession and recreational consumption by adults as well as the sale by licensed facilities, CNN projects. Had it passed, cannabis possession of up to an ounce would have been legal and some tax revenue from marijuana sales would have contributed to funding law enforcement.
Maryland legalizes recreational marijuana with ballot measure: Maryland voters on Tuesday approved a constitutional amendment that legalizes recreational marijuana for people 21 and older. It will go into effect on July 1, 2023, and allow possession of 1.5 ounces or two plants. Possession of small amounts of marijuana was already decriminalized in Maryland. Under the amendment, those previously convicted of cannabis possession and intent to distribute will be able to apply for record expungement. 
Voters end prohibitions on marijuana in Missouri: Missouri voters on Tuesday approved a constitutional amendment that ends prohibitions on marijuana in the state and allows personal use for those or those over the age of 21, CNN projects. It will allow personal possession up to 3 ounces. Additionally, the amendment allows individuals with marijuana-related non-violent offenses to petition for release from prison or parole and probation and have their records expunged. The amendment, which will be enacted 30 days after the election, prohibits marijuana facilities from selling cannabis-infused products shaped or packaged as candy that may be attractive to children. 
North Dakota voters reject ballot measure to legalize recreational marijuana: A citizen-initiated ballot measure that aimed to allow the use of marijuana in ""various forms"" for those who are at least 21 years-old was rejected by North Dakota voters, CNN projects. It would have allowed marijuana possession of up to an ounce and all marijuana is to be tested in a facility ""for the potency of products and the presence of pesticides"" and subject to random inspection. Legalization was on the ballot in four other states this November. 
South Dakota voters reject proposal to legalize recreational marijuana: Voters in South Dakota rejected a ballot measure that aimed to legalize marijuana for recreational use in the state, CNN projects. Marijuana legalization previously passed in 2020, but South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem’s office championed efforts to nullify the legalization saying that it violated the state’s constitution. The Republican governor’s office previously indicated to CNN that the 2022 measure appears to be written constitutionally and she would have implemented it if it passed. 
Voting
Nebraska voters approve measure to require ID to cast ballot: Nebraska voters have approved an initiative that would amend the state constitution to require that voters present a valid photo identification in a way that is specified by the legislature, CNN projects. To pass, “yes” needed to win a majority and votes equal to at least 35% of total votes cast in the election. 
Connecticut passes ballot measure to allow early voting: Connecticut voters have approved a measure that would amend the state constitution to permit the legislature to enact early voting, CNN projects.

Here are some key takeaways from Election Night — and where things stand now 
From CNN's Eric Bradner, Dan Merica and Gregory Krieg
The battle for control of Congress – both the House and the Senate – is coming down to a dwindling number of key races, with Democrats dashing Republicans’ hopes for a red wave and both parties hanging onto hopes of winning narrow majorities.
Republicans began the night with a rout in Florida, where Gov. Ron DeSantis won heavily Latino, historically Democratic regions on his way to a blowout victory that could serve as a launch pad for a 2024 presidential run.
But in the hours that have followed, Democrats have fought back. In Pennsylvania, Democratic Lt. Gov. John Fetterman defeated Republican Mehmet Oz for the seat of retiring Republican Sen. Pat Toomey.
Meanwhile, the battle for the House majority – one that favored Republicans, who expected to benefit from high inflation, historical trends and friendly new district lines after 2021’s redistricting – remains unsettled.
Here are some key takeaways as votes continue to be counted in key races:
Democrats go a long way to protecting their Senate majority: Republicans were not shy about the importance of Pennsylvania’s Senate race: “This is a must-win race. We believe if we win Pennsylvania, we win the majority,” said Steven Law, president of the preeminent Republican Senate super PAC. Early on Wednesday morning, CNN projected that Fetterman would be the next senator from Pennsylvania, defeating Oz in the most expensive and high stakes Senate campaign in the country. Fetterman’s win was a thunderclap for Democrats.
Democrats and the suburbs: Suburban areas across the country went a long way to helping Democrats avoid a significant red wave. Republicans may still win the House, but if the 2022 election was going to be a red wave, it was likely to come through suburban victories that have not materialized yet. Republicans did score some suburban victories – CNN projected Brandon Ogles the winner in a district around Nashville, Tom Kean Jr. winning in a suburban New Jersey district and Rich McCormick the victor in a district that included Atlanta’s northern suburbs – but it was their defeats that spoke volumes about the size of the GOP wave.
Virginia’s split decision offers early signals: Three Democratic-controlled House races in Virginia were widely viewed as an early warning signal of the night’s results. Democrats held seats in two Virginia districts Biden won in 2020. CNN projected that Democratic Jennifer Wexton won her reelection bid in Virginia’s 10th District. In an even more competitive race, CNN projected Rep. Abigail Spanberger also won reelection in Virginia’s 7th District. But Democrats lost in southeastern Virginia, with CNN projecting that Republican state Sen. Jen Kiggans defeated Democratic Rep. Elaine Luria.
Another Jan. 6 committee member loses: Luria, a member of the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, lost her Virginia Beach-based House seat, CNN projected. She had defeated former GOP Rep. Scott Taylor in 2018 and 2020. But the district had become slightly more favorable ground for Republicans in redistricting: Biden carried the previous version by 5 points, and would have lost the new district by 2 points.
DeSantis and 2024: Gov. Ron DeSantis led a dominant Republican ticket in Florida – delivering historic margins in Democratic territory in his victory over Democratic Rep. Charlie Crist on a night that provides him a powerful argument if he seeks the GOP’s 2024 presidential nomination. The easy wins by DeSantis, who led by nearly 20 percentage points with 92% of the estimated vote counted, and Sen. Marco Rubio, who was 17 points up, were enough to cast doubt on Florida’s status as a national bellwether.
GOP makes gains with Latinos in Florida: Republicans hoped to build on Trump’s inroads among Latino voters in 2020, a trend that could reshape the political landscapes in several swing states if it continues. The strongest early signal that the GOP had continued to make gains came in Miami-Dade County, home to a large Cuban population. But it’ll take a while to fully gauge whether those GOP gains take place outside of Florida.
Win for abortion rights: In Michigan, Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer – who staked her reelection campaign on her successful efforts to block the enforcement of the state’s 1931 law banning abortion in almost all instances – defeated Republican challenger Tudor Dixon, who had waged a campaign focused on cultural battles. Michigan voters also approved a Whitmer-backed amendment to the state’s constitution that will scrap that 1931 law and guarantee abortion rights. Voters in California and Vermont also green-lit constitutional amendments enshrining abortion rights.
A night of firsts: Up and down the ballot, in red states and blue, candidates from both parties are celebrating pathbreaking victories. Read about some of them here.

Maricopa County will post additional results on Wednesday night

 Election Day ballots from all 223 sites in Maricopa County, the most populous county in Arizona, have been reported as of 1:55 a.m local time, according to a tweet from the county’s elections department.
Additional results are expected to be posted Wednesday night, the county said.
As of 1:59 a.m. local time, with 90% of statewide precincts reporting, the Democratic candidates for the senate, governor and secretary of state were in the lead.
Earlier in the day, Maricopa County experienced technical problems with tabulation devices at about 20% of its voting locations, county officials said Tuesday morning, but there was no indication of intentional malfeasance despite claims to the contrary.

Multiple vehement election deniers will lose their gubernatorial races, CNN projects
From CNN's Daniel Dale 
Some of the most aggressive deniers of the 2020 election results will lose their 2022 gubernatorial races, CNN projects.
CNN found that at least 22 of the 36 Republican candidates for governor have rejected, declined to affirm, raised doubts about, or tried to overturn President Joe Biden’s victory.
Here are some of the candidates CNN projects will lose:
Doug Mastriano of Pennsylvania, who made extensive efforts to try to overturn Biden’s win. (As governor, Mastriano would have had the power to appoint the state elections chief.)
Dan Cox of Maryland, who said he didn’t recognize Biden as the president and who co-organized buses to the “Stop the Steal” rally on January 6, 2021.
Paul LePage of Maine, who falsely claimed that 2020 was “clearly a stolen election.”
Lee Zeldin of New York, who, as a member of Congress, voted against certifying Biden’s victories in Pennsylvania and Arizona.
Geoff Diehl of Massachusetts, who said in mid-2021 that the election wasn’t stolen but by 2022 was saying that it was certainly stolen.
Scott Jensen of Minnesota, who refused to affirm the legitimacy of Biden’s win and who baselessly suggested imprisoning the state’s Democratic elections chief. 
Tim Michels of Wisconsin, who baselessly claimed that “President Trump probably would be president right now if we had election integrity.”
Tudor Dixon of Michigan, who falsely claimed Trump won Michigan in 2020 even though he actually lost by more than 154,000 votes. 
Heidi Ganahl of Colorado, who refused on multiple occasions to say whether Biden was the legitimate winner and then selected a promoter of false election conspiracy theories as her running mate.
Some incumbents who denied or questioned the election results will win, CNN projects. They include:
Kay Ivey of Alabama, who ran an ad during her Republican primary that falsely claimed the 2020 election was stolen from Trump.
Brad Little of Idaho, who endorsed the Texas-led lawsuit in 2020 that sought to get the Supreme Court to overturn Biden’s win.
Kim Reynolds of Iowa, who expressed support for that Texas-led lawsuit (though she later said Biden was legitimately elected).
Greg Abbott of Texas, who also expressed support for the lawsuit led by the attorney general of his state. 
Kristi Noem of South Dakota, who baselessly claimed on Twitter that Trump was fighting “rigged election systems” and hinted that there were issues in “Democrat-run” states.

It's not at all complicated. But for some reason the left insists on trying to complicate it.

After Hillary lost, she went for a walk in the woods, wrote books, did podcasts & traveled the world advocating for human rights & democracy at large.
She didn’t once call for the Constitution to be terminated.

But do go on about how women are “too emotional to lead” won’t you.

2022 midterm election results

Updated 5:55 a.m. ET, November 9, 2022
What we covered here
Control of Senate and House still hang in the balance: It's too early to call key races — including in Nevada, Georgia, Wisconsin and Arizona — that could determine which party controls the chambers. Dozens of governorships, secretaries of states and attorneys general are also on the line.
First Senate flip of the night: Democrat John Fetterman will win Pennsylvania's Senate seat, CNN projects, and defeat Trump-backed Republican Mehmet Oz. The pick up is a big boost to Democrats' hopes of clinging to the Senate as the red wave that Republicans hoped for has yet to materialize in the House.
Historic firsts: Both parties are diversifying their ranks. Here's a look at the candidates CNN projects will make history.

A mother and son were removed as poll workers in Johns Creek, Georgia, minutes before polls opened this morning, after a social media post surfaced showing them attending the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol. 
“I stood up for what’s right today in Washington DC. This election was a sham. Mike Pence is a traitor. I was tear gassed FOUR times. I have pepper spray in my throat. I stormed the Capitol building. And my children have had the best learning experience of their lives,” one Facebook post shared with CNN by state election officials read. 
“I am aware that it occurred. That really is a Fulton County internal issue. They have to mitigate the risk the way they see fit given that information,” said Gabriel Sterling, chief operating officer for the Georgia Secretary of State’s office, when asked about it by CNN’s Erin Burnett Tuesday. 
“I think it would have been better if they found out earlier potentially and worked with the people, but since it was so last minute and it came to light so late, I leave it to Fulton County. But yes, that did happen earlier this morning,” Sterling said. 
The social media post is under “investigation for concern,” Nadine Williams, Fulton County interim director of registration and elections, said at a press conference earlier on Tuesday. 
“We decided to remove them until we could complete the investigation,” Williams said. 
“We just want to make sure the election is secure,” she added. 
Social media posts and a comment made during a poll worker event was brought to the Fulton County board’s attention by a peer. Williams said the secretary of state’s office was consulted on the matter, and the state office agreed that there was a concern. 
Williams said she was not at liberty to comment on the nature of the social media post when asked by a reporter, but she confirmed that it included a threat about election security.
“There were some things in there that were not allowed. You cannot take videos or photos in the election. That’s what brought it to our attention,” Williams said.

These are the states where mail-in ballots must be received or postmarked by Election Day
In eight US states, voters are sent a mail-in ballot automatically. Across the US, more than half of states require that mail-in ballots be received by Election Day. In 19 states, ballots can be counted if they are postmarked on or before Election Day.

Analysis: Top Senate races in 2022 have seen a staggering amount of spending
Analysis from CNN's Chris Cillizza
The five most expensive Senate races of 2022 have seen nearly $1.3 billion in spending across the primary and general elections, according to OpenSecrets, a staggering sum that speaks to the massive amounts of money flooding the political system.
Leading the way is the Pennsylvania Senate race, where Democratic Lt. Gov. John Fetterman and Republican Dr. Mehmet Oz are squaring off in the general election. All told, nearly $375 million has been spent on the race this cycle, OpenSecrets found. 
Here's how the other races in the top five stack up in terms of total spending: 
Pennsylvania: $373,605,258
Georgia: $271,351,786 
Arizona: $234,577,515 
Wisconsin: $205,791,615
Ohio: $202,117,075 
Pennsylvania was also the most expensive Senate race of the 2016 cycle, when Republican Pat Toomey was running for reelection. Total spending in that race was around $179 million, according to OpenSecrets — less than half the amount spent on the 2022 contest.
What numbers like these suggest is that attempts — earlier this century — to lessen the impact of money in politics have failed utterly. There is more money than ever before, and it's difficult to track where some of the money, spent by nonprofit groups that aren't required to disclose their donors, comes from.

37% of active Georgia voters had cast their ballot early, election official says
From CNN's Aditi Sangal

Gabriel Sterling, chief operating offer for Georgia's secretary of state's office, says voter turnout across the Peach State has been ""steady,"" although it's hard to ""it's always difficult to know in the middle of the day how it's going.""
Majority of polling locations have no lines, with average wait time of about two minutes, he told CNN Tuesday. ""It's been a very efficient process.""
Sterling also pointed to the record number of absentee ballots received in Georgia. It stands at about 234,000 ballots as of this morning, which is up from 2018's record of 213,0000 ballots, he said, adding that it takes a lot of pressure off officials when they start counting.
""We set records for early vote turnout. Between early vote and absentee — and absentee set a new record as of this morning of 234,000 for a midterm. That really takes away pressure off Election Day, because ... when we start today, nearly 37% of all our active voters had already cast a ballot,"" he said.
Sterling said that new laws passed in Georgia clarified that early in-person votes and absentee votes can be tabulated early, ""which will hopefully get us some earlier returns in the 7:15, 7:45 and 8:00 hour from even some of our larger counties.""

Wall Street braces for midterm results but inflation report may be bigger deal
From CNN’s Matt Egan

Wall Street is confident the midterm election will lead to gridlock in Washington, but traders say this week’s inflation report may prove to be far more consequential to markets.
Markets have rallied in recent days as investors bet Republicans will take control of at least one chamber of commerce, leading to divided government. Traders typically believe gridlock is good – because it means one party can’t push through legislation that messes things up.
In this case, that means Republicans can’t enact unfunded tax cuts and Democrats can’t push through unfunded spending programs, both of which would worsen inflation and lift interest rates.
“Less government, complete gridlock, will probably benefit the stock market,” Peter Tuchman, a veteran New York Stock Exchange floor trader, told CNN on Tuesday.
If Republicans win control of at least the House of Representatives, markets may have a “muted” reaction because that is widely expected, Goldman Sachs told clients in a report Monday.
Andrew Frankel, co-president of Stuart Frankel, warned that a surprisingly strong night for Democrats that allows them to retain control of both the House and Senate would cause a “meaningful move lower” for stocks. 
Multiple NYSE traders told CNN that the midterm election may be overshadowed by Thursday’s consumer price index, an inflation gauge that has become arguably the most important economic metric of the month.

Official: No indication of fraud after tabulation issue in Arizona's Maricopa County causes social media stir
From CNN's Bob Ortega
Maricopa County, Arizona, officials said that tabulating machines at about a fifth of their 223 voting locations were rejecting ballots as voting got underway on Election Day. 
According to county officials, the problem related to passwords being entered too many times, activating built-in security features. By 10 a.m. local time, county officials said the problems were being addressed and that they did not anticipate delays in voting. 
“We’ve got about 20% of the locations out there where there’s an issue with the tabulator where some of the ballots, after people have voted them, they try and run them through the tabulator and they’re not going through,” said Bill Gates, chair of the county’s Board of Supervisors. 
Gates said the elections division was working to fix the problem, but that in the meantime voters could put ballots that aren’t properly read into a secure box on the tabulator machine.
Gates said that bipartisan teams will bring the ballots to the county’s election center, where they will be counted after the polls close at 7 p.m. local time.
“No one is being disenfranchised. And none of this indicates any fraud or anything of that sort. This is a technical issue,” said Gates. 
The tabulator problems blew up on social media and right-wing media after a post showing an election worker in the Phoenix suburb of Anthem explaining the problem to voters. Figures like Donald Trump Jr., among others, reposted tweets raising concerns about problems in Arizona and in some cases suggesting it meant that the election might be “stolen.” 
Stephen Richer, the Maricopa County recorder, expressed disappointment rather than surprise at the notion the problems were being misrepresented in such a fashion. 
“Obviously, some people will exploit it for that purpose,” Richer said. ""We’re very concerned about that.” 
A county spokeswoman added that the poll worker featured in the viral video did what they were supposed to. “That poll worker at Anthem was doing their job, providing voters the information they need to participate in this election, and the options they have. He was calm and transparent,” said Megan Gilbertson of the county’s election department.

NY gubernatorial hopeful says Gov. Hochul isn't running for issues that matter to New Yorkers
From CNN’s Liam Reilly 
New York gubernatorial hopeful Rep. Lee Zeldin speaks during an event in Medford, New York, on November 8. (WCBS)
In a public appearance at a political event in Suffolk County, New York gubernatorial hopeful Rep. Lee Zeldin talked about his plans to tackle crime in the state and how his approach differs from that of his competitor, Gov. Kathy Hochul. 
Zeldin took a shot at his competitor, saying that her campaign is solely for re-election while he runs on issues.
“It’s really only been in the last few days that, all of a sudden, (Hochul) says that now she has a plan to fight crime,” Zeldin said, according to WCBS. “But, then, she followed it up with trying to ridicule New Yorkers who want to lock up criminals, saying that it’s a conspiracy, that it’s data denying. And she’s kept digging deeper and deeper a hole over the last couple of weeks."" 
He encouraged young Republicans who might eye public office in the future to stay true to themselves.
“It’s not by us making believe we’re someone else or something else,” Zeldin said. “The reason we’re going to win this race and make history, the reason why we’re going to paint all of Suffolk County red in the House races, the reason why we’re going to paint Suffolk County red in these state legislative races, the reason why we’re going to make history is by all of you being true, all of us being true to exactly what got us involved in the first place.""
Zeldin said his ideas will ensure the state government rolls back pro-criminal laws, holds district attorneys responsible if they refuse to enforce the law, and back New Yorkers in law enforcement, he said.
“(New York City Mayor Eric Adams) says that he wants judges to have discretion. He’s right. ... We need district attorneys doing their job, we don’t have a recall in this state — but, what we do have, is the New York State Constitution says that a governor can remove a DA who refuses to enforce the law. I pledge that on the first day that I’m in office, I’m going to tell the Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg that he’s being removed for his refusal to enforce the law.”

Poll workers in Michigan report higher voter turnout than expected, official says

Poll workers across Michigan are reporting higher voter turnout than expected, said Michigan Department of State spokesperson Jake Rollow. 
""We're just hearing from election workers across the state that they're pleasantly surprised by how many people are showing up to vote in person,"" he said. 
Rollow said he still expects all ballots will be counted by 8 p.m. local time on Wednesday, which is within 24 hours of polls closing. 
As of 11:30 a.m. local time today, 2,018,929 absentee ballots had been requested in Michigan, and 1,758,987 had been submitted, according to Rollow. As of 12:30 p.m. today, there were 3,666 same-day registrations across the state, he said.

Social media posts and a comment made during a poll worker event was brought to the Fulton County board’s attention by a peer. Williams said the secretary of state’s office was consulted on the matter, and the state office agreed that there was a concern. 
Williams said she was not at liberty to comment on the nature of the social media post when asked by a reporter, but she confirmed that it included a threat about election security.
“There were some things in there that were not allowed. You cannot take videos or photos in the election. That’s what brought it to our attention,” Williams said.

Analysis: Top Senate races in 2022 have seen a staggering amount of spending
Analysis from CNN's Chris Cillizza
The five most expensive Senate races of 2022 have seen nearly $1.3 billion in spending across the primary and general elections, according to OpenSecrets, a staggering sum that speaks to the massive amounts of money flooding the political system.
Leading the way is the Pennsylvania Senate race, where Democratic Lt. Gov. John Fetterman and Republican Dr. Mehmet Oz are squaring off in the general election. All told, nearly $375 million has been spent on the race this cycle, OpenSecrets found. 
Here's how the other races in the top five stack up in terms of total spending: 
Pennsylvania: $373,605,258
Georgia: $271,351,786 
Arizona: $234,577,515 
Wisconsin: $205,791,615
Ohio: $202,117,075 
Pennsylvania was also the most expensive Senate race of the 2016 cycle, when Republican Pat Toomey was running for reelection. Total spending in that race was around $179 million, according to OpenSecrets — less than half the amount spent on the 2022 contest.
What numbers like these suggest is that attempts — earlier this century — to lessen the impact of money in politics have failed utterly. There is more money than ever before, and it's difficult to track where some of the money, spent by nonprofit groups that aren't required to disclose their donors, comes from.

37% of active Georgia voters had cast their ballot early, election official says

Gabriel Sterling, chief operating offer for Georgia's secretary of state's office, says voter turnout across the Peach State has been ""steady,"" although it's hard to ""it's always difficult to know in the middle of the day how it's going.""
Majority of polling locations have no lines, with average wait time of about two minutes, he told CNN Tuesday. ""It's been a very efficient process.""
Sterling also pointed to the record number of absentee ballots received in Georgia. It stands at about 234,000 ballots as of this morning, which is up from 2018's record of 213,0000 ballots, he said, adding that it takes a lot of pressure off officials when they start counting.
""We set records for early vote turnout. Between early vote and absentee — and absentee set a new record as of this morning of 234,000 for a midterm. That really takes away pressure off Election Day, because ... when we start today, nearly 37% of all our active voters had already cast a ballot,"" he said.
Sterling said that new laws passed in Georgia clarified that early in-person votes and absentee votes can be tabulated early, ""which will hopefully get us some earlier returns in the 7:15, 7:45 and 8:00 hour from even some of our larger counties.""

Wall Street braces for midterm results but inflation report may be bigger deal
From CNN’s Matt Egan

Wall Street is confident the midterm election will lead to gridlock in Washington, but traders say this week’s inflation report may prove to be far more consequential to markets.
Markets have rallied in recent days as investors bet Republicans will take control of at least one chamber of commerce, leading to divided government. Traders typically believe gridlock is good – because it means one party can’t push through legislation that messes things up.
In this case, that means Republicans can’t enact unfunded tax cuts and Democrats can’t push through unfunded spending programs, both of which would worsen inflation and lift interest rates.
“Less government, complete gridlock, will probably benefit the stock market,” Peter Tuchman, a veteran New York Stock Exchange floor trader, told CNN on Tuesday.
If Republicans win control of at least the House of Representatives, markets may have a “muted” reaction because that is widely expected, Goldman Sachs told clients in a report Monday.
Andrew Frankel, co-president of Stuart Frankel, warned that a surprisingly strong night for Democrats that allows them to retain control of both the House and Senate would cause a “meaningful move lower” for stocks. 
Multiple NYSE traders told CNN that the midterm election may be overshadowed by Thursday’s consumer price index, an inflation gauge that has become arguably the most important economic metric of the month.

Official: No indication of fraud after tabulation issue in Arizona's Maricopa County causes social media stir
From CNN's Bob Ortega
Maricopa County, Arizona, officials said that tabulating machines at about a fifth of their 223 voting locations were rejecting ballots as voting got underway on Election Day. 
According to county officials, the problem related to passwords being entered too many times, activating built-in security features. By 10 a.m. local time, county officials said the problems were being addressed and that they did not anticipate delays in voting. 
“We’ve got about 20% of the locations out there where there’s an issue with the tabulator where some of the ballots, after people have voted them, they try and run them through the tabulator and they’re not going through,” said Bill Gates, chair of the county’s Board of Supervisors. 
Gates said the elections division was working to fix the problem, but that in the meantime voters could put ballots that aren’t properly read into a secure box on the tabulator machine.
Gates said that bipartisan teams will bring the ballots to the county’s election center, where they will be counted after the polls close at 7 p.m. local time.
“No one is being disenfranchised. And none of this indicates any fraud or anything of that sort. This is a technical issue,” said Gates. 
The tabulator problems blew up on social media and right-wing media after a post showing an election worker in the Phoenix suburb of Anthem explaining the problem to voters. Figures like Donald Trump Jr., among others, reposted tweets raising concerns about problems in Arizona and in some cases suggesting it meant that the election might be “stolen.” 
Stephen Richer, the Maricopa County recorder, expressed disappointment rather than surprise at the notion the problems were being misrepresented in such a fashion. 
“Obviously, some people will exploit it for that purpose,” Richer said. ""We’re very concerned about that.” 
A county spokeswoman added that the poll worker featured in the viral video did what they were supposed to. “That poll worker at Anthem was doing their job, providing voters the information they need to participate in this election, and the options they have. He was calm and transparent,” said Megan Gilbertson of the county’s election department.

NY gubernatorial hopeful says Gov. Hochul isn't running for issues that matter to New Yorkers
From CNN’s Liam Reilly 
New York gubernatorial hopeful Rep. Lee Zeldin speaks during an event in Medford, New York, on November 8. (WCBS)
In a public appearance at a political event in Suffolk County, New York gubernatorial hopeful Rep. Lee Zeldin talked about his plans to tackle crime in the state and how his approach differs from that of his competitor, Gov. Kathy Hochul. 
Zeldin took a shot at his competitor, saying that her campaign is solely for re-election while he runs on issues.
“It’s really only been in the last few days that, all of a sudden, (Hochul) says that now she has a plan to fight crime,” Zeldin said, according to WCBS. “But, then, she followed it up with trying to ridicule New Yorkers who want to lock up criminals, saying that it’s a conspiracy, that it’s data denying. And she’s kept digging deeper and deeper a hole over the last couple of weeks."" 
He encouraged young Republicans who might eye public office in the future to stay true to themselves.
“It’s not by us making believe we’re someone else or something else,” Zeldin said. “The reason we’re going to win this race and make history, the reason why we’re going to paint all of Suffolk County red in the House races, the reason why we’re going to paint Suffolk County red in these state legislative races, the reason why we’re going to make history is by all of you being true, all of us being true to exactly what got us involved in the first place.""
Zeldin said his ideas will ensure the state government rolls back pro-criminal laws, holds district attorneys responsible if they refuse to enforce the law, and back New Yorkers in law enforcement, he said.
“(New York City Mayor Eric Adams) says that he wants judges to have discretion. He’s right. ... We need district attorneys doing their job, we don’t have a recall in this state — but, what we do have, is the New York State Constitution says that a governor can remove a DA who refuses to enforce the law. I pledge that on the first day that I’m in office, I’m going to tell the Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg that he’s being removed for his refusal to enforce the law.”

A single winning ticket for the $2.04 billion Powerball jackpot was sold in California

 — 
A lone winning ticket for the record $2.04 billion Powerball lottery jackpot was sold in Altadena, California, lottery officials said Tuesday, making the lucky ticket holder the winner of the largest lottery prize ever.
The ticket was sold at a Joe’s Service Center, the California Lottery said on Twitter. Results posted to Powerball.com similarly said there was one winner who matched all six numbers in California – the odds of which were 1 in 292.2 million, according to the Multi-State Lottery Association.
The winning numbers, which were announced Tuesday morning after Monday night’s drawing was delayed, were 10-33-41-47-56 and the Powerball was 10, according to the association.
And while you likely weren’t the jackpot winner, lotteries are urging players to check their tickets on the chance you won one of the other – albeit smaller – prizes: Per the Multi-State Lottery Association, more than 11.2 million tickets won cash prizes totaling $98.1 million, including 22 tickets that won $1 million prizes for matching the five white numbers but not the Powerball.

The jackpot was a record $1.9 billion but grew to $2.04 billion by the time of the drawing, the association said in a statement, “making it the world’s largest lottery prize” – just as its organizers intended when they changed the odds in 2015.
In fact, the jackpot was so large that California lottery officials didn’t have the appropriate signage: At the gas station where the winning ticket was sold, just northeast of Los Angeles, they taped a “B” onto signs that read, “Millionaire made here,” so they would instead read, “Billionaire made here.”
The winner has yet to come forward, said Carolyn Becker, a spokesperson for the California lottery, adding, “Somebody is holding on to a very important piece of paper this morning.”
The ticket did, however, make one millionaire: Joseph Chahayed, the owner of the gas station, was awarded his own $1 million for being the retailer who sold the winning ticket.
Joseph Chahayed is the shop owner who sold the winning Powerball ticket. Chahayed now receives a $1 million bonus check.
CNN/CNN
Chahayed, who came to the US from Syria in 1980 with his wife and two children, told reporters he arrived at the gas station Tuesday morning to find California lottery officials waiting for him.
“They said, ‘Congratulations, your station sent a winner,’” he said, adding he hoped the winner lived in the neighborhood. The grandfather of 11 also said he was happy the lottery benefited California schools.
The announcement of a winner Tuesday came after officials delayed the drawing Monday night, due to what the Multi-State Lottery Association called a “technical issue.”
The association initially said overnight the delay was caused when one participating lottery needed more time to process its sales and play data, echoing an earlier statement by the California Lottery, which said one lottery needed additional time to complete the necessary security protocols.
On Tuesday afternoon, the Minnesota Lottery announced its sales verification system caused a processing delay, prompting the postponement of the drawing.
“The delay was necessary to confirm the Powerball drawing could be conducted securely and accurately,” the Minnesota Lottery release said. “At no time was the integrity of the process compromised.”
All 48 participating lotteries are required to submit their sales and plays before the winning numbers can be selected, the Multi-State Lottery Association said in a statement overnight. “Powerball has stringent security requirements to protect the integrity of the game and remains committed to holding a drawing that gives all players a fair chance to win,” the association said.
“Like the rest of America, Powerball is eager to hold its drawing for the world record jackpot,” the association said in a follow-up statement Tuesday morning before the drawing, “however, protecting the integrity of the draw is of upmost importance, even if that means a further delay,” the statement early Tuesday said, urging players to hold on to their tickets.
According to the Multi-State Lottery Association, Tuesday’s jackpot was hit on the 41st draw of the run, marking the sixth time the Powerball jackpot was hit in 2022. The last Powerball jackpot was won on August 3 in Pennsylvania.
Why is the Powerball prize at a record? Thank Fed Chairman Jerome Powell
The largest Powerball jackpot ever won was in January 2016, when three winners split a prize advertised at $1.586 billion. Each took their share of the cash value, which added up to $983.5 million.
Powerball draws take place every Monday, Wednesday and Saturday at 10:59 p.m. ET.
Powerball is played by charging $2 per ticket and having players choose five white balls between the numbers 1 to 69 and a red Powerball from the numbers 1 to 26. If a player gets all six numbers correct, they win the massive jackpot.
The odds of winning the jackpot by matching all 5 numbers and the Powerball number are one in 292.2 million.
Prior to 2015, though, the white balls were numbered 1 to 59 and the Powerball was numbered 1 to 35. The change means that now gamblers have better odds of winning small prizes but worse odds of winning the jackpot, making it more likely that the big number will grow to record sizes.
CNN’s Stella Chan Jack Hannah, Nick Watt, Eric Levenson, Shawn Nottingham and Chris Isidore contributed to this report.

 — 
#RedWave? #VoteBlue? Wall Street saw green on this midterm Election Day.
Stocks ended Tuesday with solid gains, extending Wall Street’s winning streak to a third straight day.
The Dow finished up almost 335 points, or 1%. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 rose 0.5% and 0.6% respectively. The Dow has now rallied more than 1,150 points since Friday.
Stocks first took off Friday after the jobs report showed solid gains in payrolls but also a slight uptick in the unemployment rate. That led to increased hopes that the Federal Reserve might soon be able to pull back on the size of its interest rate hikes.
What midterm elections could mean for the US economy
But this week’s rally seems to be mostly about politics. Investors are betting that Republicans will gain ground in the House and Senate and possibly even win control of both chambers of Congress.
If that were to happen, President Biden and the rest of the Democrats will be faced with a divided government. That could lead to more gridlock, which Wall Street often cheers.
Still, stocks have historically tended to rally following elections no matter who is in power, or whether the White House and Congress are controlled by the same party.
Truth be told, corporate earnings, economic data and interest rates matter more to Wall Street than politics.

Biden readies for ‘a horrible two years’ if GOP takes control of Congress

 — 
As if Democrats needed any more convincing Tuesday’s midterm elections carry enormous stakes, President Joe Biden offered a bluntly dire assessment during a fundraiser last Friday in Chicago.
“If we lose the House and Senate, it’s going to be a horrible two years,” Biden told the small crowd gathered inside a hotel ballroom, where cameras weren’t allowed. “The good news is I’ll have a veto pen.”
After two years of Democratic control of Congress, a change in leadership in the House or Senate – or both – would thrust Biden’s presidency into an entirely new phase. Biden himself has been projecting optimism in the final days of the campaign, but reality is setting in for Democrats their majority rule in Congress could soon end – and Biden’s ability to get his top priorities passed could go with it.
White House officials have begun pointing out their losses aren’t likely to be nearly as bad as previous midterm wipeouts, including in 2010, and say the fact Democrats have a fighting chance at all is a positive sign for Biden. But his advisers privately acknowledge that they don’t see a viable path for Democrats to hold onto their House majority, though the president and his senior team are starting the day with the view that the prospect of Democrats holding on to their Senate majority is real – even if it’s one that may take days, or longer, to be fully realized.
With the intraparty blame game set to boil over in the weeks ahead, the White House moved Tuesday to separate Biden’s agenda – and the president himself – from the list of targets. The White House circulated an Election Day memo to allies more than two dozen individual poll results they say underscores the popularity of the key individual elements of Biden’s agenda, ranging from his cornerstone legislative achievements to his actions on student loans, marijuana and his administration’s response to Covid-19
“Before all the votes have even been cast, pundits are declaring that these midterms have been a referendum on the president’s agenda – nothing could be further from the truth,” the memo, which was obtained by CNN, says in its introduction.
Yet even Biden has acknowledged that his agenda, no matter how it polls in isolation, hasn’t translated to an American public that has taken a largely negative view on the direction of the country.
“We’ve passed so many good things,” Biden said at a fundraising event last week. “They’ve been so good people haven’t realized how good they are yet.”
The effort to get in front of expected losses comes after months of frontline Democratic candidates actively seeking to separate themselves from Biden, relegating the party’s leader mostly to Democratic states and districts as the party scrambled to save its majorities. It’s a reality advisers say Biden doesn’t take personally. After 36 years in the Senate, Biden’s view has long been that the candidates know what’s best for their state or district. But as Biden’s approval ratings started to inch up in the last few months, White House officials have bristled at the view that he was a singular drag on Democrats.
The defensive tone in the memo echoes a message Biden has repeatedly sought to emphasize in the closing days of the campaign, one that centers on the idea that the election represents a choice between two parties, not a referendum on Biden or his presidency.
A loss of a few seats – Republicans need only pick up five seats to take control of the House – would mean dramatic changes for the president.
Here are four areas that are at stake this Tuesday for Biden and his administration:
GOP investigations
Republicans on Capitol Hill have made abundantly clear that if they take control of Congress, Biden should get ready: Investigations are coming his way.
A majority in the House or Senate would hand GOP lawmakers powerful chairmanships on a number of oversight committees, giving them the ability to launch investigations targeting Biden, the White House and even members of the president’s family.
And so far, Republican members have indicated that they’re eager to target all of the above.
GOP lawmakers including Reps. James Comer and Jim Jordan, who are likely to chair the House Oversight and Judiciary committees respectively, are getting ready to probe a range of issues, from the business dealings of Biden’s son, Hunter; to what Republicans allege is political interference by the FBI and Justice Department; to the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic.
And that’s not to mention the drumbeat of impeachment talk – for Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas or even the president himself.

White House officials have been expecting and preparing for this new world for months, including by making personnel hires earlier this summer to beef up its oversight operations. Officials say if Republicans do in fact, take control of Congress, the White House is prepared to beef up those efforts even more with additional hires, and believe it will be ready to push back on future GOP investigations as lacking in merit, politically motivated and nefarious.
While officials have been cautious not to get in front of any GOP actions or pre-judge the results of the election, they are also keenly aware of political dynamics that may work in their favor, people familiar with the matter said.
“American people historically don’t respond well to egregious overreach,” one of the people told CNN, specifically citing a new Republican majority’s battles with former President Bill Clinton. “We’ll be prepared, but it’s tough to look at House Republicans and think this won’t wander into that territory.”
Agenda
The historic likelihood that Biden would lose seats – and majorities – in Congress has loomed over the White House his entire term so far. It is part of what motivated the president’s ambitious legislative agenda, including major Covid-19 relief and a bipartisan infrastructure package, in the earliest months of his presidency.
If Republicans gain control of one or both chambers, the era of big, progressive bills will likely end. Instead, Biden will be on the defense as Republicans work to undo much of what he accomplished in the first two years of his term.
The GOP has already vowed to roll back elements of Biden’s signature legislation, the Inflation Reduction Act, including its new, higher taxes on corporations. And they could work to roll back or challenge some of the president’s climate initiatives that are included in the package.
Other areas where the president has vowed action, like cementing into law the nationwide right to abortion, would have no chance of advancing if Republicans take control. And other programs, like student loan relief, could be subject to blocking efforts by the GOP.
In all of these areas, Biden is poised to wield his veto pen in rejecting potential Republican attempts to undermine his agenda. As president, Biden has not vetoed any bills, a facet of Democratic control on Capitol Hill.
White House officials have already been quietly preparing for the areas where agreement is a necessity – spending bills and an increase of the nation’s debt limit. The two issues represent must-pass items that have been at the center of a series of Congress vs. White House battles over the last decade.
House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, a California Republican, has been among a number of House Republicans who have pledged to deploy similar tactics should they take the majority.

The first concrete signs of how that may play out will quickly become apparent. Lawmakers will return to Capitol Hill this month with a matter of weeks to reach an agreement to fund the government.
At the same time, Biden has a long history of working with Republicans to advance pieces of legislation. And he vowed when running for office to find areas to work across the aisle, something he was able to do on several of his key cornerstone legislative wins.
Biden advisers point to the $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure law and the $250 billion semiconductor manufacturing and science bill as providing a road map to bipartisan success.
Biden’s 2024 decision
As soon as the 2022 midterm election results are in, national attention will immediately turn to 2024 – including on the question of whether Biden will seek a second term.
While Biden and his aides have been quietly thinking about his political future for months and they have accelerated conversations in the last month, those deliberations will accelerate with the close of the midterm cycle. Biden has pointed to family meetings during the holiday stretch as important to his decision-making, though people familiar with the matter say first lady Dr. Jill Biden and others are on board with another run.
For weeks, the president and his advisers have maintained that his intention, for now, is to run again. Biden moved quickly to transfer his 2020 operation to the Democratic National Committee after he defeated former President DonaldTrump. The party committee has spent the last two years maintaining and beefing up his grassroots list, fundraising pipeline and building out state-level infrastructure that would make up the critical infrastructure of a nascent campaign.
They’ve also said that no decision is final until the president has had ample opportunity to discuss his political future with his family. But Biden’s 2024 decision won’t just be a family affair – there will also be strong political dynamics at play.
For one, Trump’s decision to seek a second term – and the timing of that potential announcement – is expected to be a key factor. Biden advisers continue to believe that the president is best positioned to take on his predecessor, and are confident about a second Biden vs. Trump contest.

Another consideration: How fellow Democrats respond to the results of Tuesday night. Polling from this fall indicates a majority of Democrats say they do not want Biden to run again in 2024. And losses for Democrats could only exacerbate the sense within the party that a change in direction is required.
While many elected officials in Biden’s party have been loyal in expressing their public support for a second term, some others have openly called for change.
Democratic Rep. Dean Phillips of Minnesota, who said over the summer that he does not believe Biden should run again, told CNN on the eve of Election Day that he believes “a majority of Democrats” feel the same way.
“Regardless of tomorrow’s results, I believe Democrats must rebuild our brand and repopulate our bench of future leaders – for both Congress and the White House,” Phillips said. “President Biden has fulfilled his promise to serve as a stabilizing ‘bridge’ to the future, and I expect a majority of Democrats will be seeking a next generation candidate to take the baton in 2024.”
Staffing changes
Biden has seen remarkably little turnover in the first two years of his tenure among his Cabinet and senior team. The halfway mark of his first term, however, could be a natural moment for staff changes.
It reflects a reluctance to shake up his team, despite calls at various points to dismiss members of his administration. Biden has refrained from firing or asking for the resignation of any members of his Cabinet and sought to lock in his senior team months ahead of this year’s midterms.
There has been turnover among his senior staff, including in top West Wing positions. His press secretary, White House counsel and senior adviser for public engagement all left earlier this year. Some officials decided to leave the White House around the one-year mark of the administration, while others departed at the start of summer.
But Biden’s inner circle remains mostly intact. That includes chief of staff Ron Klain, senior advisers Mike Donilon and Steve Ricchetti, deputy chiefs of staff Bruce Reed and Jen O’Malley Dillon, communications director Kate Bedingfield and top communications adviser Anita Dunn.
Officials have said changes are possible both to the president’s Cabinet and his senior White House staff later this year, though no moves are guaranteed. Should Biden announce his decision to run in 2024, several of the members of his core team are considered likely to shift over to the political operation.
Earlier this fall, the White House established a talent search project to prepare for potential vacancies across Cabinet and senior administration roles following the midterm elections.
Klain brought forward the talent search idea, which will be overseen by two Biden White House alums, Jeff Zients and Natalie Quillian. The pair served in similar roles during the 2020 presidential transition.
“It’s just good government to make sure that you’re thinking ahead,” O’Malley Dillon said during an Axios event last week. “The people that are part of this and helping make that change are the people that you’d expect, and you want to see.”
Zients and Quillian – who both served in Covid-19 response roles at the White House earlier in Biden’s presidential term – have specifically been conducting a wide and diverse search for prospective candidates outside the administration to fill Cabinet, deputy Cabinet and senior administration roles.
Some top officials, like Covid adviser Dr. Anthony Fauci, are preparing to leave soon. Climate envoy John Kerry has told CNN he plans to stay in the administration at least until this week’s major climate conference in Egypt – without indicating whether he’ll stay longer. And Biden recently appointed a seasoned veteran of Democratic White Houses, John Podesta, to serve as his climate adviser.
The future of other officials is unclear. Klain has been the subject of speculation, and it is typical for White House chiefs of staff to serve only a portion of a president’s term. But as Biden faces the inevitable personnel transition that all presidents experience after the midterms, Klain’s deeply ingrained role in all corners of the West Wing’s operations may create even more incentive for him to stick around, some officials note, even as they acknowledge he’s given no indication of his intentions.
A potential replacement has been floated in Dunn, who would be the first woman to serve in the role.
“I like the job I have,” Dunn insisted at the Axios event. She added, “I hope Ron Klain stays as long as Joe Biden is president.”

2022 midterm election results

Updated 5:55 a.m. ET, November 9, 2022
What we covered here
Control of Senate and House still hang in the balance: It's too early to call key races — including in Nevada, Georgia, Wisconsin and Arizona — that could determine which party controls the chambers. Dozens of governorships, secretaries of states and attorneys general are also on the line.
First Senate flip of the night: Democrat John Fetterman will win Pennsylvania's Senate seat, CNN projects, and defeat Trump-backed Republican Mehmet Oz. The pick up is a big boost to Democrats' hopes of clinging to the Senate as the red wave that Republicans hoped for has yet to materialize in the House.
Historic firsts: Both parties are diversifying their ranks. Here's a look at the candidates CNN projects will make history.

Official: No indication of fraud after tabulation issue in Arizona's Maricopa County causes social media stir
From CNN's Bob Ortega
Maricopa County, Arizona, officials said that tabulating machines at about a fifth of their 223 voting locations were rejecting ballots as voting got underway on Election Day. 
According to county officials, the problem related to passwords being entered too many times, activating built-in security features. By 10 a.m. local time, county officials said the problems were being addressed and that they did not anticipate delays in voting. 
“We’ve got about 20% of the locations out there where there’s an issue with the tabulator where some of the ballots, after people have voted them, they try and run them through the tabulator and they’re not going through,” said Bill Gates, chair of the county’s Board of Supervisors. 
Gates said the elections division was working to fix the problem, but that in the meantime voters could put ballots that aren’t properly read into a secure box on the tabulator machine.
Gates said that bipartisan teams will bring the ballots to the county’s election center, where they will be counted after the polls close at 7 p.m. local time.
“No one is being disenfranchised. And none of this indicates any fraud or anything of that sort. This is a technical issue,” said Gates. 
The tabulator problems blew up on social media and right-wing media after a post showing an election worker in the Phoenix suburb of Anthem explaining the problem to voters. Figures like Donald Trump Jr., among others, reposted tweets raising concerns about problems in Arizona and in some cases suggesting it meant that the election might be “stolen.” 
Stephen Richer, the Maricopa County recorder, expressed disappointment rather than surprise at the notion the problems were being misrepresented in such a fashion. 
“Obviously, some people will exploit it for that purpose,” Richer said. ""We’re very concerned about that.” 
A county spokeswoman added that the poll worker featured in the viral video did what they were supposed to. “That poll worker at Anthem was doing their job, providing voters the information they need to participate in this election, and the options they have. He was calm and transparent,” said Megan Gilbertson of the county’s election department.

NY gubernatorial hopeful says Gov. Hochul isn't running for issues that matter to New Yorkers
From CNN’s Liam Reilly 
New York gubernatorial hopeful Rep. Lee Zeldin speaks during an event in Medford, New York, on November 8. (WCBS)
In a public appearance at a political event in Suffolk County, New York gubernatorial hopeful Rep. Lee Zeldin talked about his plans to tackle crime in the state and how his approach differs from that of his competitor, Gov. Kathy Hochul. 
Zeldin took a shot at his competitor, saying that her campaign is solely for re-election while he runs on issues.
“It’s really only been in the last few days that, all of a sudden, (Hochul) says that now she has a plan to fight crime,” Zeldin said, according to WCBS. “But, then, she followed it up with trying to ridicule New Yorkers who want to lock up criminals, saying that it’s a conspiracy, that it’s data denying. And she’s kept digging deeper and deeper a hole over the last couple of weeks."" 
He encouraged young Republicans who might eye public office in the future to stay true to themselves.
“It’s not by us making believe we’re someone else or something else,” Zeldin said. “The reason we’re going to win this race and make history, the reason why we’re going to paint all of Suffolk County red in the House races, the reason why we’re going to paint Suffolk County red in these state legislative races, the reason why we’re going to make history is by all of you being true, all of us being true to exactly what got us involved in the first place.""
Zeldin said his ideas will ensure the state government rolls back pro-criminal laws, holds district attorneys responsible if they refuse to enforce the law, and back New Yorkers in law enforcement, he said.
“(New York City Mayor Eric Adams) says that he wants judges to have discretion. He’s right. ... We need district attorneys doing their job, we don’t have a recall in this state — but, what we do have, is the New York State Constitution says that a governor can remove a DA who refuses to enforce the law. I pledge that on the first day that I’m in office, I’m going to tell the Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg that he’s being removed for his refusal to enforce the law.”

Florida to DOJ: Federal election monitors not allowed inside polling locations
From CNN's Geneva Sands and Steve Contorno
Florida officials warned the US Justice Department that federal election monitors are not allowed inside polling places under state law, pushing back against federal plans for monitors in the state.
In a letter to DOJ dated Monday, Florida state elections officials argued that federal officials are not included on the list of people allowed inside polling places, and even if they did qualify, it “would be counterproductive and could potentially undermine confidence in the election.”
The Justice Department announced plans to send elections monitors to 24 states, including three counties in Florida – Broward, Miami-Dade and Palm Beach. The practice of sending federal election monitors to local jurisdictions dates back decades.
But the department did “not detail the need for federal monitors in these counties,” Florida Department of State General Counsel Brad McVay wrote to DOJ in the letter.
The Florida Department of State will send its own monitors to the three jurisdictions, according to the letter, to “ensure that there is no interference with the voting process.”
Florida Secretary of State Cord Byrd, an appointee of Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, who is running for reelection, told reporters Tuesday morning that the request by DOJ to go inside polling places was a deviation from years past when the agency sent monitors to Florida. The DOJ under former President Donald Trump sent monitors to six Florida counties in 2020, but Byrd said they kept tabs from outside the polling location.
“This is not to be confrontational in any way,” Byrd said. “They sent a letter to the counties asking for permission to be in the polling places. We told them that under state law, that is not permitted, and we asked them to respect state law, and that they can go there and do their job, but they have to do that job outside of the polling place.”
Asked why the state didn’t send a similar letter in 2020 when Trump’s DOJ monitored six Florida counties, Byrd said there was no change in policy.
The Justice Department told CNN it has received the letter but declined to comment.

Trump says he voted for DeSantis, predicts ""great night"" for GOP
From CNN's Gabby Orr

Former President Donald Trump confirmed Tuesday that he voted for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, predicting a ""great night"" for Republicans. 
""Yes, I did,"" Trump told reporters when asked if he cast a ballot for DeSantis outside a polling location in Palm Beach where he voted. 
""I think we're going to have a very great night and it's exciting,"" he added. 
Trump cast his ballot shortly after 11:30 a.m. ET at the Morton and Barbara Mandel Recreation Center in Palm Beach, just minutes away from his Mar-a-Lago estate where he plans to watch election returns this evening with dozens of aides, allies, and local Republicans. He arrived with former first lady Melania Trump and briefly took questions outside after voting indoors. 
The former president's political future may largely depend on Tuesday's midterm outcomes, as he looks for his handpicked and endorsed candidates in key federal and statewide races to prevail. Major losses for Trump-backed candidates could create obstacles for his 2024 presidential campaign, which Trump is eyeing to announce one week from today. 
At a rally in Pennsylvania on Saturday, Trump referred to the Florida governor as “Ron DeSanctimonious.”

Meanwhile: Atlanta-area special grand jury will hold a hearing on Trump's effort to overturn the 2020 election
From CNN's Jason Morris
Attorney Lin Wood tells CNN he will appear before the special grand jury that is investigating efforts by former President Donald Trump and his allies to overturn the 2020 election in Georgia as a material witness tomorrow morning. 
The Special Purpose Grand Jury that is being led by Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis returns tomorrow after taking a roughly one-month hiatus around the election.
Wood, a staunch Trump supporter, is a veteran defense attorney who focused on civil litigation and has worked on high-profile cases in the Atlanta-area.
He pushed a series of cases after the 2020 Presidential election that were rapidly dismissed by the courts, and described as disinformation by state election officials. 
Investigators are also interested in hearing from Wood about a meeting he held at his South Carolina home with other supporters of the former president working on election challenges after the 2020 election. 
CNN has reached out to the Fulton County DA for comment.

When is it a wave? 
Analysis by Zachary B. Wolf
The sun rises at the US Capitol in Washington, DC, on November 8. (Joshua Roberts/Reuters)
You might hear that word — ""wave"" — thrown around this week if Republicans take some power from Democrats on Election Day. They'll argue they have been given a mandate from American voters.
Republicans could seriously underperform their potential, considering President Biden's approval rating and the historical precedent, and still pick up five seats and the House majority.
Is that a wave? Power will have changed dramatically. But it feels closer to a course correction than a major change in government. Here's a full list of House majority changessince the start of the modern party system just before the Civil War.
Sean Trende of RealClearPolitics and the American Enterprise Institute argued back in 2018, just before Democrats reclaimed the House from Republicans, that it's a wave election if there is ""a sharp, unusually large shift in the national balance of power, across multiple levels of government."" You'd need GOP victories in multiple governor's races and a Senate majority to make the change in power be reflected across multiple levels of government. 
Trende added some statistical criteria to argue an election is a wave election if it is outside the shift in power during an election. It might be easier to put a round number as a baseline and argue a swing of 50 or more House seats is a wave.
By the 50-seat rule, the 2010 midterm election was certainly a Tea Party wave with a change of 64 seats in the House. The 1994 Republican revolution was a wave when the GOP gained 54 seats. 
The 2006 midterm where Democrats gained the majority with a 32-seat gain would not be a wave, even though it made Nancy Pelosi speaker of the House and gave Democrats a Senate majority. Trende argued 2006 could be viewed as a wave in conjunction with 2008, when Democrats gained an additional 21 seats in the House.
But the 2018 midterm, when there was a 42-seat change, would not have been a wave, even though it restored Pelosi as House speaker. In any event, with this year's election, Republicans seem poised to once again take back control of the House.

Vice President Harris is spending Election Day in Los Angeles
From CNN's Jasmine Wright
While the White House is bracing for possible Election Day loses, Vice President Kamala Harris woke up this morning in rainy Los Angeles after telling a groups of organizers Monday night that Democrats would “see victory.” 
Harris started Tuesday with her normal routine, a senior Harris adviser tells CNN, maintaining her daily morning workout and attending her normal meetings, which means receiving some form of the president’s daily briefing while in Los Angeles.
The vice president will receive regular updates on election news throughout the day from a host of staff in California, the Executive Building in DC, while aides stay connected with officials at the Democratic National Committee and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and other Democratic Party officials who track midterms results closely.
Harris is scheduled to spend Election Day calling into radio stations for quick interviews meant to drive turnout at 11:00 a.m. ET and 4:30 p.m. ET while her husband, second gentleman Doug Emhoff, joins NARAL Pro-Choice America for a virtual political event on reproductive rights.
Aides are also actively discussing if and how Harris could make an in-person and public Election Day stop somewhere in L.A., but are cognizant of how the vice president’s large footprint could impede ground organizers during crucial voting hours. 
The vice president and second gentleman voted by filling out mail-in-ballots, which Emhoff said he would drop off after a rally on Monday.
In the evening, Harris will watch the returns come in, but her location to watch return remains in flux and aides would not disclose exactly what the options are.

A plan to tax the rich to fund electric defeated by California voters
By Peter Valdes-Dapena, CNN Business
Updated 10:45 AM EST, Wed November 9, 2022

 — 
California has long been a leader among states, and even countries, in promoting a shift to electric cars, including with its plans to ban the sale of purely gas-powered cars by 2035. But California voters appear to have rejected a ballot proposal that, its proponents claimed, what have helped accelerate that shift by taxing the wealthiest Californians to help pay for electric vehicle tax incentives and EV chargers in the state.
The measure is trailing 59% to 41% according to state results, with 94.8% of ballots counted. CNN has not projected a result.
The initiative, Proposition 30, would have added an additional 1.75% tax on incomes above $2 million. Most of the money was to go toward funding incentives for electric vehicle purchases and installing EV chargers, with a large part of it going to lower-income communities. Another 20% of the funds were to be used to pay for wildfire prevention and additional firefighter training.
Opponents of the ballot initiative claimed it was really just an attempt by one tech company to benefit itself at the expense of other priorities. The initiative is unnecessary at best, they claimed, and might have even harmed the state’s economy by pushing wealthy residents to leave.
The difference isn’t entirely along party lines
While the proposal was backed by the state’s Democratic party, California Governor Gavin Newsom, a Democrat who won re-election Tuesday night, came out publicly against it. In a TV ad, Newsom called it “one company’s cynical scheme to grab a huge tax-payer-funded subsidy.”
Newsom was referring to the ride-sharing company Lyft, which provided 95% of the financing behind the ballot initiative, according to state records. Opponents of the ballot initiative claimed Lyft’s support was self-serving.
State regulations passed in 2021 require that 90% of ride-sharing miles traveled in the state must be emissions-free by 2030. Companies like Lyft and its main competitor, Uber, don’t buy the cars their drivers use, as they consider the drivers to be “independent contractors” who supply their own vehicles. But a rule like Prop 30 would make it easier for just about anyone in California to buy an electric car, including Lyft drivers. Without Prop 30’s state-supported financial incentives for electric vehicles, Lyft might be forced to subsidize its drivers’ EV purchases from its own funds, opponents said.
But being good for a specific industry or company doesn’t mean a law isn’t also beneficial to the general welfare, proponents pointed out. The law could have helped all kinds of low income Californians purchase and charge electric vehicles, not just ride-share drivers.
Lyft referred questions about its backing for the proposition to Steven Maviglio, a political consultant campaigning for the proposal. The company spent nearly $50 million to campaign for the proposal, records show.
It’s harder than it should be for EV drivers to find available chargers in California right now, Maviglio said in an interview with CNN Business shortly before the vote. And electric cars are too expensive for lower income residents to afford, so the financial support is needed, especially with sales of gas cars being banned in the future.
“It’s going to fall harder on those who can’t afford the cars,” Maviglio said.
California an American electric car leader
But there were real questions about whether such a law was needed in a state that already heavily supports electric vehicles.
“California has been prioritizing electrification for, really, the last 10, 15 years,” said Bruce Babcock, professor of public policy and University of California Riverside. “And, so, they are really trying to get this right and they have been funding things.”
While proponents of Proposition 30 pointed out that it would have provided a secure funding stream for electric vehicles, opponents said that was not necessarily desirable and may, counter intuitively, not give electric car sales the boost backers are looking for.
“The job of the legislature is to prioritize spending given the competing demands,” said Babcock. “And so what will happen is, suddenly, you start having a dedicated funding source. What that will do is take the pressure off the legislature and they’ll just fund it less.”
Just as a family given money to buy, specifically, dairy products would probably just spend less of its own money on milk and butter, a law like this could end up not resulting in substantially more money for EVs.
“I don’t know if there’d be a net gain,” Babcock said before the vote, “but it wouldn’t be as big as backers say.”
And an additional 1.75% on income over $2 million might not sound like much – after all, these aren’t people scraping by on their meager salaries – but it would have been taken by a state that already relies heavily on money from its wealthiest residents, Babcock said.
“I think it’s a concern because California gets more than half of its income tax from the top half a percent of taxpayers,” he said.
Other states, like Texas and Florida, tax the wealthy at much lower rates or not at all. By continuing to turn to the wealthy to finance the state’s budget this way, California risks alienating entrepreneurs and investors, Babcock said, in a state with more than its fair share of both. But no such large-scale exodus has apparently ever happened, said Maviglio.
“We have four times as many people making $2 million or more in the state than we did five years ago,” he said. “So that category of people is not leaving the state because of taxes. They’re doing, actually, much better.”
The most crucial objection, though, said Matthew Rodriguez, a political consultant leading a campaign against Proposition 30, was simply the precedent that it would set. Corporations that want certain laws passed can go through the legislative process, speaking with elected representatives in the legislature, rather than trying to put new laws on the ballot. And Lyft has been down this road before. as it was part of a coalition of companies that, through another ballot initiative, avoided having to classify their gig workers in the state as employees. (That ballot measure has been challenged in court.)

WI is not even close for the senate. Johnson(R) has it confortably. 
Our only close one is the race for governor, though I believe Michels(R) will likely get the win, but just barely and there will be a recount.

Control of Senate and House still hang in the balance: It's too early to call key races — including in Nevada, Georgia, Wisconsin and Arizona — that could determine which party controls the chambers. Dozens of governorships, secretaries of states and attorneys general are also on the line.
First Senate flip of the night: Democrat John Fetterman will win Pennsylvania's Senate seat, CNN projects, and defeat Trump-backed Republican Mehmet Oz. The pick up is a big boost to Democrats' hopes of clinging to the Senate as the red wave that Republicans hoped for has yet to materialize in the House.
Historic firsts: Both parties are diversifying their ranks. Here's a look at the candidates CNN projects will make history.

From recreational marijuana to voting initiatives, here are the latest decisions on key ballot measures

Voters around the country weighed in on key ballot measures on Tuesday, including initiatives that require IDs to vote and others that would legalize recreational marijuana.
Here's what we know so far:
Marijuana
Arkansas voters reject recreational marijuana ballot initiative: Arkansas voters on Tuesday rejected a constitutional amendment that would have allowed cannabis possession and recreational consumption by adults as well as the sale by licensed facilities, CNN projects. Had it passed, cannabis possession of up to an ounce would have been legal and some tax revenue from marijuana sales would have contributed to funding law enforcement.
Maryland legalizes recreational marijuana with ballot measure: Maryland voters on Tuesday approved a constitutional amendment that legalizes recreational marijuana for people 21 and older. It will go into effect on July 1, 2023, and allow possession of 1.5 ounces or two plants. Possession of small amounts of marijuana was already decriminalized in Maryland. Under the amendment, those previously convicted of cannabis possession and intent to distribute will be able to apply for record expungement. 
Voters end prohibitions on marijuana in Missouri: Missouri voters on Tuesday approved a constitutional amendment that ends prohibitions on marijuana in the state and allows personal use for those or those over the age of 21, CNN projects. It will allow personal possession up to 3 ounces. Additionally, the amendment allows individuals with marijuana-related non-violent offenses to petition for release from prison or parole and probation and have their records expunged. The amendment, which will be enacted 30 days after the election, prohibits marijuana facilities from selling cannabis-infused products shaped or packaged as candy that may be attractive to children. 
North Dakota voters reject ballot measure to legalize recreational marijuana: A citizen-initiated ballot measure that aimed to allow the use of marijuana in ""various forms"" for those who are at least 21 years-old was rejected by North Dakota voters, CNN projects. It would have allowed marijuana possession of up to an ounce and all marijuana is to be tested in a facility ""for the potency of products and the presence of pesticides"" and subject to random inspection. Legalization was on the ballot in four other states this November. 
South Dakota voters reject proposal to legalize recreational marijuana: Voters in South Dakota rejected a ballot measure that aimed to legalize marijuana for recreational use in the state, CNN projects. Marijuana legalization previously passed in 2020, but South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem’s office championed efforts to nullify the legalization saying that it violated the state’s constitution. The Republican governor’s office previously indicated to CNN that the 2022 measure appears to be written constitutionally and she would have implemented it if it passed. 
Voting
Nebraska voters approve measure to require ID to cast ballot: Nebraska voters have approved an initiative that would amend the state constitution to require that voters present a valid photo identification in a way that is specified by the legislature, CNN projects. To pass, “yes” needed to win a majority and votes equal to at least 35% of total votes cast in the election. 
Connecticut passes ballot measure to allow early voting: Connecticut voters have approved a measure that would amend the state constitution to permit the legislature to enact early voting, CNN projects.

Here are some key takeaways from Election Night — and where things stand now 
From CNN's Eric Bradner, Dan Merica and Gregory Krieg
The battle for control of Congress – both the House and the Senate – is coming down to a dwindling number of key races, with Democrats dashing Republicans’ hopes for a red wave and both parties hanging onto hopes of winning narrow majorities.
Republicans began the night with a rout in Florida, where Gov. Ron DeSantis won heavily Latino, historically Democratic regions on his way to a blowout victory that could serve as a launch pad for a 2024 presidential run.
But in the hours that have followed, Democrats have fought back. In Pennsylvania, Democratic Lt. Gov. John Fetterman defeated Republican Mehmet Oz for the seat of retiring Republican Sen. Pat Toomey.
Meanwhile, the battle for the House majority – one that favored Republicans, who expected to benefit from high inflation, historical trends and friendly new district lines after 2021’s redistricting – remains unsettled.
Here are some key takeaways as votes continue to be counted in key races:
Democrats go a long way to protecting their Senate majority: Republicans were not shy about the importance of Pennsylvania’s Senate race: “This is a must-win race. We believe if we win Pennsylvania, we win the majority,” said Steven Law, president of the preeminent Republican Senate super PAC. Early on Wednesday morning, CNN projected that Fetterman would be the next senator from Pennsylvania, defeating Oz in the most expensive and high stakes Senate campaign in the country. Fetterman’s win was a thunderclap for Democrats.
Democrats and the suburbs: Suburban areas across the country went a long way to helping Democrats avoid a significant red wave. Republicans may still win the House, but if the 2022 election was going to be a red wave, it was likely to come through suburban victories that have not materialized yet. Republicans did score some suburban victories – CNN projected Brandon Ogles the winner in a district around Nashville, Tom Kean Jr. winning in a suburban New Jersey district and Rich McCormick the victor in a district that included Atlanta’s northern suburbs – but it was their defeats that spoke volumes about the size of the GOP wave.
Virginia’s split decision offers early signals: Three Democratic-controlled House races in Virginia were widely viewed as an early warning signal of the night’s results. Democrats held seats in two Virginia districts Biden won in 2020. CNN projected that Democratic Jennifer Wexton won her reelection bid in Virginia’s 10th District. In an even more competitive race, CNN projected Rep. Abigail Spanberger also won reelection in Virginia’s 7th District. But Democrats lost in southeastern Virginia, with CNN projecting that Republican state Sen. Jen Kiggans defeated Democratic Rep. Elaine Luria.
Another Jan. 6 committee member loses: Luria, a member of the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, lost her Virginia Beach-based House seat, CNN projected. She had defeated former GOP Rep. Scott Taylor in 2018 and 2020. But the district had become slightly more favorable ground for Republicans in redistricting: Biden carried the previous version by 5 points, and would have lost the new district by 2 points.
DeSantis and 2024: Gov. Ron DeSantis led a dominant Republican ticket in Florida – delivering historic margins in Democratic territory in his victory over Democratic Rep. Charlie Crist on a night that provides him a powerful argument if he seeks the GOP’s 2024 presidential nomination. The easy wins by DeSantis, who led by nearly 20 percentage points with 92% of the estimated vote counted, and Sen. Marco Rubio, who was 17 points up, were enough to cast doubt on Florida’s status as a national bellwether.
GOP makes gains with Latinos in Florida: Republicans hoped to build on Trump’s inroads among Latino voters in 2020, a trend that could reshape the political landscapes in several swing states if it continues. The strongest early signal that the GOP had continued to make gains came in Miami-Dade County, home to a large Cuban population. But it’ll take a while to fully gauge whether those GOP gains take place outside of Florida.
Win for abortion rights: In Michigan, Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer – who staked her reelection campaign on her successful efforts to block the enforcement of the state’s 1931 law banning abortion in almost all instances – defeated Republican challenger Tudor Dixon, who had waged a campaign focused on cultural battles. Michigan voters also approved a Whitmer-backed amendment to the state’s constitution that will scrap that 1931 law and guarantee abortion rights. Voters in California and Vermont also green-lit constitutional amendments enshrining abortion rights.
A night of firsts: Up and down the ballot, in red states and blue, candidates from both parties are celebrating pathbreaking victories. Read about some of them here.

Maricopa County will post additional results on Wednesday night
From CNN’s Tara Subramaniam

 Election Day ballots from all 223 sites in Maricopa County, the most populous county in Arizona, have been reported as of 1:55 a.m local time, according to a tweet from the county’s elections department.
Additional results are expected to be posted Wednesday night, the county said.
As of 1:59 a.m. local time, with 90% of statewide precincts reporting, the Democratic candidates for the senate, governor and secretary of state were in the lead.
Earlier in the day, Maricopa County experienced technical problems with tabulation devices at about 20% of its voting locations, county officials said Tuesday morning, but there was no indication of intentional malfeasance despite claims to the contrary.

Multiple vehement election deniers will lose their gubernatorial races, CNN projects
From CNN's Daniel Dale 
Some of the most aggressive deniers of the 2020 election results will lose their 2022 gubernatorial races, CNN projects.
CNN found that at least 22 of the 36 Republican candidates for governor have rejected, declined to affirm, raised doubts about, or tried to overturn President Joe Biden’s victory.
Here are some of the candidates CNN projects will lose:
Doug Mastriano of Pennsylvania, who made extensive efforts to try to overturn Biden’s win. (As governor, Mastriano would have had the power to appoint the state elections chief.)
Dan Cox of Maryland, who said he didn’t recognize Biden as the president and who co-organized buses to the “Stop the Steal” rally on January 6, 2021.
Paul LePage of Maine, who falsely claimed that 2020 was “clearly a stolen election.”
Lee Zeldin of New York, who, as a member of Congress, voted against certifying Biden’s victories in Pennsylvania and Arizona.
Geoff Diehl of Massachusetts, who said in mid-2021 that the election wasn’t stolen but by 2022 was saying that it was certainly stolen.
Scott Jensen of Minnesota, who refused to affirm the legitimacy of Biden’s win and who baselessly suggested imprisoning the state’s Democratic elections chief. 
Tim Michels of Wisconsin, who baselessly claimed that “President Trump probably would be president right now if we had election integrity.”
Tudor Dixon of Michigan, who falsely claimed Trump won Michigan in 2020 even though he actually lost by more than 154,000 votes. 
Heidi Ganahl of Colorado, who refused on multiple occasions to say whether Biden was the legitimate winner and then selected a promoter of false election conspiracy theories as her running mate.
Some incumbents who denied or questioned the election results will win, CNN projects. They include:
Kay Ivey of Alabama, who ran an ad during her Republican primary that falsely claimed the 2020 election was stolen from Trump.
Brad Little of Idaho, who endorsed the Texas-led lawsuit in 2020 that sought to get the Supreme Court to overturn Biden’s win.
Kim Reynolds of Iowa, who expressed support for that Texas-led lawsuit (though she later said Biden was legitimately elected).
Greg Abbott of Texas, who also expressed support for the lawsuit led by the attorney general of his state. 
Kristi Noem of South Dakota, who baselessly claimed on Twitter that Trump was fighting “rigged election systems” and hinted that there were issues in “Democrat-run” states.

After Hillary lost, she went for a walk in the woods, wrote books, did podcasts & traveled the world advocating for human rights & democracy at large.
She didn’t once call for the Constitution to be terminated.

But do go on about how women are “too emotional to lead” won’t you.

Florida to DOJ: Federal election monitors not allowed inside polling locations
From CNN's Geneva Sands and Steve Contorno
Florida officials warned the US Justice Department that federal election monitors are not allowed inside polling places under state law, pushing back against federal plans for monitors in the state.
In a letter to DOJ dated Monday, Florida state elections officials argued that federal officials are not included on the list of people allowed inside polling places, and even if they did qualify, it “would be counterproductive and could potentially undermine confidence in the election.”
The Justice Department announced plans to send elections monitors to 24 states, including three counties in Florida – Broward, Miami-Dade and Palm Beach. The practice of sending federal election monitors to local jurisdictions dates back decades.
But the department did “not detail the need for federal monitors in these counties,” Florida Department of State General Counsel Brad McVay wrote to DOJ in the letter.
The Florida Department of State will send its own monitors to the three jurisdictions, according to the letter, to “ensure that there is no interference with the voting process.”
Florida Secretary of State Cord Byrd, an appointee of Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, who is running for reelection, told reporters Tuesday morning that the request by DOJ to go inside polling places was a deviation from years past when the agency sent monitors to Florida. The DOJ under former President Donald Trump sent monitors to six Florida counties in 2020, but Byrd said they kept tabs from outside the polling location.
“This is not to be confrontational in any way,” Byrd said. “They sent a letter to the counties asking for permission to be in the polling places. We told them that under state law, that is not permitted, and we asked them to respect state law, and that they can go there and do their job, but they have to do that job outside of the polling place.”
Asked why the state didn’t send a similar letter in 2020 when Trump’s DOJ monitored six Florida counties, Byrd said there was no change in policy.
The Justice Department told CNN it has received the letter but declined to comment.

Trump says he voted for DeSantis, predicts ""great night"" for GOP
From CNN's Gabby Orr

Former President Donald Trump confirmed Tuesday that he voted for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, predicting a ""great night"" for Republicans. 
""Yes, I did,"" Trump told reporters when asked if he cast a ballot for DeSantis outside a polling location in Palm Beach where he voted. 
""I think we're going to have a very great night and it's exciting,"" he added. 
Trump cast his ballot shortly after 11:30 a.m. ET at the Morton and Barbara Mandel Recreation Center in Palm Beach, just minutes away from his Mar-a-Lago estate where he plans to watch election returns this evening with dozens of aides, allies, and local Republicans. He arrived with former first lady Melania Trump and briefly took questions outside after voting indoors. 
The former president's political future may largely depend on Tuesday's midterm outcomes, as he looks for his handpicked and endorsed candidates in key federal and statewide races to prevail. Major losses for Trump-backed candidates could create obstacles for his 2024 presidential campaign, which Trump is eyeing to announce one week from today. 
At a rally in Pennsylvania on Saturday, Trump referred to the Florida governor as “Ron DeSanctimonious.”
11:43 a.m. ET, November 8, 2022
Meanwhile: Atlanta-area special grand jury will hold a hearing on Trump's effort to overturn the 2020 election
From CNN's Jason Morris
Attorney Lin Wood tells CNN he will appear before the special grand jury that is investigating efforts by former President Donald Trump and his allies to overturn the 2020 election in Georgia as a material witness tomorrow morning. 
The Special Purpose Grand Jury that is being led by Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis returns tomorrow after taking a roughly one-month hiatus around the election.
Wood, a staunch Trump supporter, is a veteran defense attorney who focused on civil litigation and has worked on high-profile cases in the Atlanta-area.
He pushed a series of cases after the 2020 Presidential election that were rapidly dismissed by the courts, and described as disinformation by state election officials. 
Investigators are also interested in hearing from Wood about a meeting he held at his South Carolina home with other supporters of the former president working on election challenges after the 2020 election. 
CNN has reached out to the Fulton County DA for comment.

When is it a wave? 
Analysis by Zachary B. Wolf
The sun rises at the US Capitol in Washington, DC, on November 8. (Joshua Roberts/Reuters)
You might hear that word — ""wave"" — thrown around this week if Republicans take some power from Democrats on Election Day. They'll argue they have been given a mandate from American voters.
Republicans could seriously underperform their potential, considering President Biden's approval rating and the historical precedent, and still pick up five seats and the House majority.
Is that a wave? Power will have changed dramatically. But it feels closer to a course correction than a major change in government. Here's a full list of House majority changessince the start of the modern party system just before the Civil War.
Sean Trende of RealClearPolitics and the American Enterprise Institute argued back in 2018, just before Democrats reclaimed the House from Republicans, that it's a wave election if there is ""a sharp, unusually large shift in the national balance of power, across multiple levels of government."" You'd need GOP victories in multiple governor's races and a Senate majority to make the change in power be reflected across multiple levels of government. 
Trende added some statistical criteria to argue an election is a wave election if it is outside the shift in power during an election. It might be easier to put a round number as a baseline and argue a swing of 50 or more House seats is a wave.
By the 50-seat rule, the 2010 midterm election was certainly a Tea Party wave with a change of 64 seats in the House. The 1994 Republican revolution was a wave when the GOP gained 54 seats. 
The 2006 midterm where Democrats gained the majority with a 32-seat gain would not be a wave, even though it made Nancy Pelosi speaker of the House and gave Democrats a Senate majority. Trende argued 2006 could be viewed as a wave in conjunction with 2008, when Democrats gained an additional 21 seats in the House.
But the 2018 midterm, when there was a 42-seat change, would not have been a wave, even though it restored Pelosi as House speaker. In any event, with this year's election, Republicans seem poised to once again take back control of the House.

Vice President Harris is spending Election Day in Los Angeles
From CNN's Jasmine Wright
While the White House is bracing for possible Election Day loses, Vice President Kamala Harris woke up this morning in rainy Los Angeles after telling a groups of organizers Monday night that Democrats would “see victory.” 
Harris started Tuesday with her normal routine, a senior Harris adviser tells CNN, maintaining her daily morning workout and attending her normal meetings, which means receiving some form of the president’s daily briefing while in Los Angeles.
The vice president will receive regular updates on election news throughout the day from a host of staff in California, the Executive Building in DC, while aides stay connected with officials at the Democratic National Committee and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and other Democratic Party officials who track midterms results closely.
Harris is scheduled to spend Election Day calling into radio stations for quick interviews meant to drive turnout at 11:00 a.m. ET and 4:30 p.m. ET while her husband, second gentleman Doug Emhoff, joins NARAL Pro-Choice America for a virtual political event on reproductive rights.
Aides are also actively discussing if and how Harris could make an in-person and public Election Day stop somewhere in L.A., but are cognizant of how the vice president’s large footprint could impede ground organizers during crucial voting hours. 
The vice president and second gentleman voted by filling out mail-in-ballots, which Emhoff said he would drop off after a rally on Monday.
In the evening, Harris will watch the returns come in, but her location to watch return remains in flux and aides would not disclose exactly what the options are.

Voting rights advocates report relatively smooth start to voting in several states
From CNN's Fredreka Schouten

Voting rights advocates in key states said the first hours of voting in Tuesday’s midterms appeared to be going smoothly with only isolated problems reported.
“What we are seeing are things that we usually see on Election Day,” said Susannah Goodman, director of election security at Common Cause. “Sometimes voters are going in and one of the voting machines isn’t working or lines are a little longer.”
The key battleground state of Pennsylvania is “not experiencing anything systemic,” Khalif Ali, executive director of Common Cause Pennsylvania, told reporters late Tuesday morning.
He said there were a handful of calls about polls opening late in eastern parts of the state and some isolated incidents of electioneering occurring too close to polling places in Allegheny County. He said poll workers quickly addressed the problem by moving the people farther away.
A key issue in Pennsylvania remains the thousands of mail-in ballots are risk of being rejected because of missing or incorrect dates on the return envelope. Ali said he does not know how many ballots are affected statewide.
In Florida, Common Cause’s Amy Keith said more than 15,000 mail-in ballots had been flagged across the Sunshine State for signature problems or other issues as late last week.
Under state law, voters have until 5 p.m. ET Thursday to fix problems with those ballots. But Keith encouraged voters to go online to track their ballots and quickly resolve any issues before potential disruptions from tropical storm Nicole, which is bearing down on the state.

2020 election lies have officials on edge for problems at polling places and lawsuits Tuesday | CNN Politics

Nearly 3,600 Philadelphia mail-in ballots at risk of rejection
From CNN's Linh Tran and Fredreka Schouten
An election official in Philadelphia on Tuesday told CNN nearly 3,600 mail-in ballots risk being rejected because of incorrect information, missing dates or missing secrecy envelopes.
The increase of roughly 200 ballots was added over the weekend. Roughly 250 of the 3,600 mail-in ballots have been cured. People who weren’t able to cure their ballots at city hall can still vote provisionally today. 
On Saturday, election officials in Philadelphia said more than 3,400 mail-in ballots risked being rejected because of incorrect information, missing dates or missing secrecy envelopes.
Philadelphia City Commissioners’ Chairwoman Lisa Deeley released the affected voters’ names and urged them to take immediate steps to get replacement ballots.
The action by Deeley came after the state Supreme Court last week barred local election officials from counting ballots with missing or incorrect dates on the return envelope. 
“I am extremely disappointed in the Pennsylvania Supreme Court's decision with regard to undated and incorrectly dated ballots,” Deeley said in a statement. “Handwritten dates are not material and the lack of such a date should not be a reason to disenfranchise a voter.” 
Pennsylvania’s requirement that voters sign and provide a handwritten date on their ballot return envelope has been the subject of litigation for months. And on Friday, several Pennsylvania groups, including the state branches of the NAACP and the League of Women Voters, filed a lawsuit in federal court, challenging the state’s plan to not count undated ballots.
The lawsuit calls a missing or incorrect date “a meaningless technicality” and argues that throwing out a ballot on those grounds violates federal civil rights law.

More than 45 million pre-election ballots cast 
From CNN's Ethan Cohen

As voters head to the polls on Election Day, more than 45 million pre-election ballots have already been cast across the 47 states where figures were available, according to data from elections officials, Edison Research and Catalist.
Pre-election voting has been ahead of the 2018 pace across the states where data is available for the last three cycles. However, it’s still too early to know if overall turnout will reach 2018 levels, as voting patterns may have changed in the last few years. 
Texas still has the most pre-election votes, with more than 5.4 million ballots cast. Florida has had more than 4.9 million ballots cast, and California has more than 4.7 million. Georgia, with more than 2.5 million ballots cast, and North Carolina, with more than 2.1 million, are the only other states with more than 2 million ballots cast so far. 
The number of ballots cast will continue to increase as more mail is delivered, voters drop off their ballots and election officials update their tallies. 
Some voter data comes from Catalist, a company that provides data, analytics and other services to Democrats, academics and nonprofit issue-advocacy organizations and is giving insights into who is voting before November.

Georgia voter says one of the biggest issues for her is sustaining Social Security
From CNN's Jeff Zeleny in Marietta, Georgia
Lavonne Cobb voted today with her economic future in mind – and that’s why she said she cast her ballot for Democratic candidates.
“Social Security is a big issue when it comes to voting,” said Cobb, 50, pausing to talk for a moment as she left the county civic center in Marietta, Georgia. “I came out to make sure that I put in my vote so that my generation will have some type of security in the future.”
For all the millions of dollars in TV ads – about a quarter billion in the Senate race alone during Georgia’s primary and general elections – Cobb expressed exhaustion and excitement at Election Day.
“It’s entertaining,” she said of the barrage of ads, “but I am so ready for it to be over.”
She supported Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock, as she did two years ago.
“He hasn’t seemed to let me down,” Cobb said. “You know when you go to a restaurant, you stick with what you know, then you don’t have to worry about being disappointed? I stuck with what I know.”

2022 midterm election results

Updated 5:55 a.m. ET, November 9, 2022
What we covered here
Control of Senate and House still hang in the balance: It's too early to call key races — including in Nevada, Georgia, Wisconsin and Arizona — that could determine which party controls the chambers. Dozens of governorships, secretaries of states and attorneys general are also on the line.
First Senate flip of the night: Democrat John Fetterman will win Pennsylvania's Senate seat, CNN projects, and defeat Trump-backed Republican Mehmet Oz. The pick up is a big boost to Democrats' hopes of clinging to the Senate as the red wave that Republicans hoped for has yet to materialize in the House.
Historic firsts: Both parties are diversifying their ranks. Here's a look at the candidates CNN projects will make history.

Florida to DOJ: Federal election monitors not allowed inside polling locations
From CNN's Geneva Sands and Steve Contorno
Florida officials warned the US Justice Department that federal election monitors are not allowed inside polling places under state law, pushing back against federal plans for monitors in the state.
In a letter to DOJ dated Monday, Florida state elections officials argued that federal officials are not included on the list of people allowed inside polling places, and even if they did qualify, it “would be counterproductive and could potentially undermine confidence in the election.”
The Justice Department announced plans to send elections monitors to 24 states, including three counties in Florida – Broward, Miami-Dade and Palm Beach. The practice of sending federal election monitors to local jurisdictions dates back decades.
But the department did “not detail the need for federal monitors in these counties,” Florida Department of State General Counsel Brad McVay wrote to DOJ in the letter.
The Florida Department of State will send its own monitors to the three jurisdictions, according to the letter, to “ensure that there is no interference with the voting process.”
Florida Secretary of State Cord Byrd, an appointee of Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, who is running for reelection, told reporters Tuesday morning that the request by DOJ to go inside polling places was a deviation from years past when the agency sent monitors to Florida. The DOJ under former President Donald Trump sent monitors to six Florida counties in 2020, but Byrd said they kept tabs from outside the polling location.
“This is not to be confrontational in any way,” Byrd said. “They sent a letter to the counties asking for permission to be in the polling places. We told them that under state law, that is not permitted, and we asked them to respect state law, and that they can go there and do their job, but they have to do that job outside of the polling place.”
Asked why the state didn’t send a similar letter in 2020 when Trump’s DOJ monitored six Florida counties, Byrd said there was no change in policy.
The Justice Department told CNN it has received the letter but declined to comment.

Trump says he voted for DeSantis, predicts ""great night"" for GOP
From CNN's Gabby Orr

Former President Donald Trump confirmed Tuesday that he voted for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, predicting a ""great night"" for Republicans. 
""Yes, I did,"" Trump told reporters when asked if he cast a ballot for DeSantis outside a polling location in Palm Beach where he voted. 
""I think we're going to have a very great night and it's exciting,"" he added. 
Trump cast his ballot shortly after 11:30 a.m. ET at the Morton and Barbara Mandel Recreation Center in Palm Beach, just minutes away from his Mar-a-Lago estate where he plans to watch election returns this evening with dozens of aides, allies, and local Republicans. He arrived with former first lady Melania Trump and briefly took questions outside after voting indoors. 
The former president's political future may largely depend on Tuesday's midterm outcomes, as he looks for his handpicked and endorsed candidates in key federal and statewide races to prevail. Major losses for Trump-backed candidates could create obstacles for his 2024 presidential campaign, which Trump is eyeing to announce one week from today. 
At a rally in Pennsylvania on Saturday, Trump referred to the Florida governor as “Ron DeSanctimonious.”

Meanwhile: Atlanta-area special grand jury will hold a hearing on Trump's effort to overturn the 2020 election
From CNN's Jason Morris
Attorney Lin Wood tells CNN he will appear before the special grand jury that is investigating efforts by former President Donald Trump and his allies to overturn the 2020 election in Georgia as a material witness tomorrow morning. 
The Special Purpose Grand Jury that is being led by Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis returns tomorrow after taking a roughly one-month hiatus around the election.
Wood, a staunch Trump supporter, is a veteran defense attorney who focused on civil litigation and has worked on high-profile cases in the Atlanta-area.
He pushed a series of cases after the 2020 Presidential election that were rapidly dismissed by the courts, and described as disinformation by state election officials. 
Investigators are also interested in hearing from Wood about a meeting he held at his South Carolina home with other supporters of the former president working on election challenges after the 2020 election. 
CNN has reached out to the Fulton County DA for comment.

When is it a wave? 
Analysis by Zachary B. Wolf

You might hear that word — ""wave"" — thrown around this week if Republicans take some power from Democrats on Election Day. They'll argue they have been given a mandate from American voters.
Republicans could seriously underperform their potential, considering President Biden's approval rating and the historical precedent, and still pick up five seats and the House majority.
Is that a wave? Power will have changed dramatically. But it feels closer to a course correction than a major change in government. Here's a full list of House majority changessince the start of the modern party system just before the Civil War.
Sean Trende of RealClearPolitics and the American Enterprise Institute argued back in 2018, just before Democrats reclaimed the House from Republicans, that it's a wave election if there is ""a sharp, unusually large shift in the national balance of power, across multiple levels of government."" You'd need GOP victories in multiple governor's races and a Senate majority to make the change in power be reflected across multiple levels of government. 
Trende added some statistical criteria to argue an election is a wave election if it is outside the shift in power during an election. It might be easier to put a round number as a baseline and argue a swing of 50 or more House seats is a wave.
By the 50-seat rule, the 2010 midterm election was certainly a Tea Party wave with a change of 64 seats in the House. The 1994 Republican revolution was a wave when the GOP gained 54 seats. 
The 2006 midterm where Democrats gained the majority with a 32-seat gain would not be a wave, even though it made Nancy Pelosi speaker of the House and gave Democrats a Senate majority. Trende argued 2006 could be viewed as a wave in conjunction with 2008, when Democrats gained an additional 21 seats in the House.
But the 2018 midterm, when there was a 42-seat change, would not have been a wave, even though it restored Pelosi as House speaker. In any event, with this year's election, Republicans seem poised to once again take back control of the House.

Vice President Harris is spending Election Day in Los Angeles
From CNN's Jasmine Wright
While the White House is bracing for possible Election Day loses, Vice President Kamala Harris woke up this morning in rainy Los Angeles after telling a groups of organizers Monday night that Democrats would “see victory.” 
Harris started Tuesday with her normal routine, a senior Harris adviser tells CNN, maintaining her daily morning workout and attending her normal meetings, which means receiving some form of the president’s daily briefing while in Los Angeles.
The vice president will receive regular updates on election news throughout the day from a host of staff in California, the Executive Building in DC, while aides stay connected with officials at the Democratic National Committee and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and other Democratic Party officials who track midterms results closely.
Harris is scheduled to spend Election Day calling into radio stations for quick interviews meant to drive turnout at 11:00 a.m. ET and 4:30 p.m. ET while her husband, second gentleman Doug Emhoff, joins NARAL Pro-Choice America for a virtual political event on reproductive rights.
Aides are also actively discussing if and how Harris could make an in-person and public Election Day stop somewhere in L.A., but are cognizant of how the vice president’s large footprint could impede ground organizers during crucial voting hours. 
The vice president and second gentleman voted by filling out mail-in-ballots, which Emhoff said he would drop off after a rally on Monday.
In the evening, Harris will watch the returns come in, but her location to watch return remains in flux and aides would not disclose exactly what the options are.

Voting rights advocates report relatively smooth start to voting in several states

Voting goes mostly smoothly on Election Day as baseless fraud claims swirl
By Jeremy Herb, Eric Levenson and Fredreka Schouten, CNN

 — 
State and local elections officials said Tuesday’s voting in the midterm elections went smoothly overall, with a few isolated problems reported, including in the key swing state of Arizona where issues with voting machines sparked baseless claims about fraud.
In Maricopa County, Arizona’s most populous, Republicans filed a lawsuit seeking to keep polls open three hours after they were scheduled to close, claiming there were excessive delays and long lines due to ballot tabulator malfunctions. A county judge, however, denied the request, saying that while some voters may have been confused or faced difficulties, he “does not have any evidence” voters were unable to vote.
Maricopa County officials said tabulators had tech issues in about 20% of its voting locations. Maricopa County chairman Bill Gates and recorder Stephen Richer advised voters experiencing issues to put their ballots inside a secure box attached to the tabulators and assured they would be counted by bipartisan vote counters after polls close.
“There was no one who came today with a valid ID who was turned away from the polls,” Gates told reporters Tuesday afternoon. “Even when we had this [issue] and we hadn’t figured out the solution, people were still able to vote. It was just a matter of maybe not voting in the way they wanted to.”

But the tabulator problems were baselessly played up as signs of voter fraud in right-wing media, including by Donald Trump Jr., after a post showed an election worker in the Phoenix suburb of Anthem explaining the problem to voters.
Election officials have particularly faced newfound pressures from the conspiratorial right. Led by former President Donald Trump, a growing number of Republican politicians have attacked the legitimacy of the vote and repeated false claims that the 2020 election was stolen. On Tuesday, Trump and his allies were quick to launch similar baseless attacks.
“Same thing is happening with Voter Fraud as happened in 2020???” Trump wrote Tuesday afternoon on his Truth Social platform. Trump also amplified a false claim about voter fraud in Michigan through his social media.
There was no evidence of widespread or outcome-changing voter fraud in the 2020 election, and there was no early sign on Tuesday of any significant voter fraud in the 2022 midterms. Voter fraud typically represents a tiny fraction of ballots cast in US elections.
In addition to the conspiracies about vote tabulators in Maricopa County, Charlie Kirk, the founder of right-wing group Turning Point USA, falsely tweeted there was a “2 hour wait minimum” at most polling places in the county. Maricopa County debunked the claim, and the county’s online wait-time tracker showed dozens of polling locations had waits of under five minutes.

State and local officials and voting rights advocates have raised the alarm that the political attacks, including a marked rise in threats of violence against election workers, have sparked an exodus of local elections officials in charge of the vote.
Among the most serious issues was in a suburb of Milwaukee, where a 38-year-old man was arrested after threatening voters with a knife, briefly forcing one polling place to close.
The man demanded that staff “stop the voting,” the West Bend Police Department said in a statement. He was arrested without incident and no injuries were reported, police said.
Despite these concerns, the vast majority of the tens of millions who cast ballots on Tuesday will do so without issue, in an election where early voting has been ahead of 2018 levels. Roughly 8 in 10 of voters in this year’s midterms said they were at least somewhat confident that elections in their state are being conducted fairly and accurately, according to the preliminary national results of the exit poll conducted for CNN and other news networks by Edison Research.
While multiple states reported attempted cyberattacks on their websites on Election Day – including a “sustained outage” of a website in Mississippi – none of the hacks have prevented anyone from voting, federal officials told reporters Tuesday evening.
Takeaways from the 2022 midterm elections
“What we are seeing are things that we usually see on Election Day,” said Susannah Goodman, director of election security at Common Cause. “Sometimes voters are going in and one of the voting machines isn’t working, or lines are a little longer.”
Secretaries of state reported few problems. “I would say this was a very smooth election,” Virginia Elections Commissioner Susan Beals told reporters Tuesday evening.
Michigan Department of State spokesperson Jake Rollow said Tuesday that “things are going smoothly” with elections in the state. Pennsylvania’s acting Democratic secretary of state, Leigh Chapman, said Tuesday that while it would take “a few days” for the state to finish counting its results, as expected, there were just “a handful of typical Election Day incidents,” including a few polling places opening late, power outages and a gas leak.
“All were quickly handled,” she said.
Cynthia Nogar, who voted for Democratic candidates in Rochester, Minnesota, told CNN her voting location at a local church was organized and went smoothly despite her own concerns.
“I couldn’t help but be a little concerned about what might happen … but it was just as quiet as usual,” she said. “That was really nice. It was kind of a relief, you know?”

The vast majority of voting issues were decidedly minor and small scale, such as long lines, bad weather or tech glitches.
In a handful of counties across the country, there were problems that prompted precincts to stay open later.
Six precincts across Georgia were ordered to remain open later because they opened late Tuesday morning, according to Gabriel Sterling, Georgia’s acting Deputy Secretary of State.

In Bell County, Texas, polls were kept open an additional hour after some check-in machines at voting centers were not working Tuesday morning due to synchronization issues tied to the switch from Daylight Saving Time. A judge in Houston ordered voting locations in Harris County to stay open for an additional hour after several polling locations didn’t open on time.
The North Carolina Board of Elections voted unanimously to allow three polling precincts to close an hour later in North Carolina after their opening was delayed.
And in Pennsylvania, approximately 44 polling places were impacted by a paper shortage in Luzerne County, prompting an extension of in-person voting, according to a spokesperson for the Pennsylvania Department of State.
Further, an extra verification process to ensure voters didn’t vote both by mail and in person could delay counting ballots and getting election results in Philadelphia, a spokesperson for the Philadelphia City Commissioners told CNN on Tuesday.

In Florida’s Palm Beach County, officials are vowing to keep their main elections office open “as long as we possibly can” to count ballots with Tropical Storm Nicole expected to make landfall late Wednesday night or early Thursday morning. The storm is currently expected to become a hurricane and remain a hurricane when it reaches Florida.
“At this point, we’re thinking we can make it through without a big effect on the election,” the county’s Supervisor of Elections Wendy Sartory Link told CNN on Tuesday, while noting that worsening road conditions could cause some delays as officials retrieve ballot drop boxes.
Intimidation issues
In North Carolina, roughly 15 incidents of alleged intimidation have been reported to the state Board of Elections since the start of early in-person voting.
Incidents included some individuals outside of a county board of elections shooting video of an election worker’s license plate and one situation where an election worker was followed from the voting site to the elections office and then followed to their neighborhood.
In Arizona, the secretary of state’s office has sent 18 referrals to law enforcement related to drop-box intimidation, including a threatening message toward a government worker and several voters reporting being filmed at drop box locations in Maricopa County last week.

Judge restricts how right-wing group can patrol drop boxes
04:13 - Source: CNN
A federal judge earlier this month imposed new restrictions against a right-wing group in the state following complaints about aggressive patrols of ballot boxes in the state, including blocking the members from openly carrying guns or wearing body armor.
In Beaumont, Texas, a federal judge barred poll workers at an election site from engaging in conduct that Black voters said was intimidating.
US District Judge Michael J. Truncale issued the temporary restraining order Monday in a case brought by Beaumont’s chapter of the NAACP, which alleged that White poll workers spoke aggressively to Black voters, hovered too close behind them while voting and declined to help them cast their ballots.
Federal officials have warned that domestic violent extremists pose a heightened threat to the 2022 midterms.

Meet the team behind CNN’s famous ‘Magic Wall’

CNN
 — 
CNN’s John King has become synonymous with the “Magic Wall,” a touchscreen display featuring a vast array of up-to-date voting data on election night. His incredibly fast-paced breakdown of that data and his breadth of knowledge across the political spectrum has gained the attention of many news organizations, fans on social media and even late-night hosts.
But behind the camera, there is an entire team of experts who create the technical magic that King and other correspondents showcase on live television.
The Magic Wall team, from left to right: David Reisner, Lauren Holt, Billy Holbert, Pallavi Reddy, Caroline Tounget, John Murphy
We talked to the producers and designers who upload the data and create the graphics that power the Magic Wall to learn how the technology has evolved over the past few election cycles — and what new features we can look forward to seeing during the 2022 Midterms.
Here’s a portion of our conversation, edited for length and clarity:
The Magic Wall made its debut in 2008. What was that premiere like and how has the technology changed since then?
David Reisner, senior producer: This is before people had iPhones in their pockets, right? So this was unheard of technology at the time, coupled with trying to program this visual storytelling of very, very dense, heavy data that we’ve been familiar with for years — but created in such a way that it was interactive and an extension of John King’s vast political knowledge at the time. So the question was, how do we break down the brain dump of all the knowledge that he has? He was able to call out a primary in Cuyahoga County in the ’80s like that (snaps), now we can just quickly click that and show the world how that visually is compelling.
John Murphy, senior producer: One example would be what we call replay mode. Before 2020, the wall only showed the latest vote counts. In 2020, between the pandemic and the order that votes were being counted, we knew the results would take longer than usual and states could flip from red to blue or vice versa depending on whether states counted mail-in ballots or in-person ballots first. That created the so-called blue mirages and red mirages. We needed a way for the wall to go back 24 hours or 48 hours to show how the counts had changed and explain why that had happened — so we built a system in about four weeks to do exactly that.
Pallavi Reddy, senior director: The challenge is making sure that we’re keeping up with the storylines and the politics of of day. But at the same time, there’s a simplicity in that. The Magic Wall doesn’t change; it will always show you election data and facts. And that’s kind of what makes it really a powerful part of what we use for election night. Regardless of what kind of noise is going on in the political sphere, it’s just always about election data and where it stands at the moment and how to inform our viewers using that exact data and nothing else.
How is John King able to access so much historical voting data in the Magic Wall?
Billy Holbert, senior producer: We always like to say that if John King were a jazz player, this is his instrument. We create this tool to keep up with him and to be one step ahead — that’s our challenge, always. So the presidential data in the tool itself goes back to 1980. We can show you where and how people voted for Jimmy Carter or Ronald Reagan, down to the county level. In 2014, all this had to be converted and uploaded manually. Pallavi and I spent quite a while on this, getting carpal tunnel along the way.
VIDEO
John King has been covering elections for 40 years. Here's why this one is different
Caroline Tounget, producer: We bang on just about every piece of what this Magic Wall can do — and maybe then some — so we know that we have done everything John may do before it gets to him in front of the cameras.
What are other things, besides current and past voting tallies, that the Magic Wall displays?
Tounget: There are things called “demographic layers” that we put in the Magic Wall during the 2020 election to show not just demographics — like where like the Black or Hispanic voter population may be — but also things like where Covid concentrations are really high and how that data have progressed throughout the months.
Anything new that we should expect to see on Tuesday?
Lauren Holt, producer: A big thing that we’ve been spending a lot of time on this year is that there’s a completely new redistricted (congressional) map because the census underwent a recount. So a cool new feature that will be great in this redistricting year is our congressional district by county tool. In every House race and every district, John (King) is going to be able to dial in and then break that down even further into smaller pieces — which is county level.
Unlike any other year where you would just sort of see a single color representing the candidate in the lead, you’re now going to be able to see a county breakdown of who is leading in which county. That gives a much more contextual look at the results rather than just the two top line numbers.
How would you like to evolve the Magic Wall technology in the future?
Holt: There are so many stories that are rooted in data, and the Magic Wall’s capabilities can be applied outside of elections and politics — whether that’s climate-related or economic- related. The world very much runs on data. I think a lot of people realized that in 2020 when Covid happened and everyone all of a sudden became very aware of the CDC’s data visualization dashboard.
Reddy: I would love to put this in the hands of our viewers so that they can watch John King or Phil Mattingly on election night at the Magic Wall and they can also drill down into the storylines that matter to them as viewers. You can go and get that information yourself and be your own John King at home.
This isn’t a touchscreen technology. This is data visualization. The more visualizations that you can apply to data, the better our reporting will be, the better our data analysis, the better context we can give our viewers. And then the more we can put that in the hands of our audience — digital or TV or whatever — the better it is for all of us.

WATCH LIVE: CNN's special coverage of midterm election results
2022 midterm election results
By Aditi Sangal, Adrienne Vogt, Elise Hammond, Maureen Chowdhury, Clare Foran, Meg Wagner, Melissa Macaya, Joe Ruiz and Seán Federico-OMurchú, CNN
Updated 5:55 a.m. ET, November 9, 2022
What we covered here
Control of Senate and House still hang in the balance: It's too early to call key races — including in Nevada, Georgia, Wisconsin and Arizona — that could determine which party controls the chambers. Dozens of governorships, secretaries of states and attorneys general are also on the line.
First Senate flip of the night: Democrat John Fetterman will win Pennsylvania's Senate seat, CNN projects, and defeat Trump-backed Republican Mehmet Oz. The pick up is a big boost to Democrats' hopes of clinging to the Senate as the red wave that Republicans hoped for has yet to materialize in the House.
Historic firsts: Both parties are diversifying their ranks. Here's a look at the candidates CNN projects will make history.

There has been no significant hacking activity to disrupt midterm elections, US cyber officials say
From CNN's Sean Lyngaas

US officials “continue to see no specific or credible threat to disrupt election infrastructure” as polls open across the country for the midterm elections, a senior US cybersecurity official told reporters Tuesday morning.
Officials have not seen any significant hacking activity on Election Day that they can attribute to any given hacking group, an official from the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency told reporters in a background briefing.
Officials are expecting the possibility of low-level cyberattacks that may temporarily knock state and local websites offline, but nothing that will prevent voters from casting a ballot, the CISA official said. 
“We continue to remain in high confidence in the security or resilience of the elections,” the official added. 
US Cyber Command, the Defense Department’s hacking unit, and the National Security Agency are “sharing real-time” intelligence with government agencies to help defend the midterm elections from foreign threats, the four-star general who heads both operations said in a statement Tuesday. 
“We continue to refine what we learned from the 2018 and 2020 elections,” Gen. Paul Nakasone said. “We generate insight to enable defense of the homeland, and ultimately impose costs by degrading and exposing foreign adversary capabilities and operations.”
Cyber Command has taken a much more active role in defending US elections from foreign interference since Russia’s 2016 intervention. That included an operation during the 2018 midterm elections that temporarily blocked internet access for a notorious Russia troll farm. 
Nakasone reiterated what US intelligence officials have said for weeks: They are wary of foreign influence campaigns that continue after Election Day as the vote tallies come in. 
“Our work does not end on Nov. 8,” Nakasone said. 
Twelve states activated National Guard troops for local and state-level cyber election support, according to a Defense Department spokesperson. 
Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Iowa, Illinois, Louisiana, North Carolina, New Mexico, West Virginia and Washington state activated National Guard troops for cyber election support. A total of 92 members were activated across the 12 states to assist, the spokesperson added. 
During election primaries in May and June, the National Guard provided cyber support to eight states, the spokesperson added.

Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson cast his ballot with his wife, Jane, at a polling location in Oshkosh on Tuesday. Afterwards, he spoke to reporters, saying his message to every Republican voter is to ""get out and vote.""
“I just want to encourage every Republican to get out and vote. Assume this is a dead even race,” he said. “I'd like to win by a wide margin — not for partisan purposes, but literally, so we’ll send a very strong signal to our Democrat colleagues that their policies aren't working.” 
The Wisconsin Republican, who’s been locked in a dead even race with Democratic Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes, told reporters he’s “cautiously optimistic” about his chances on election night.
“But again, my message to Republican voters is assume this is a dead even race, get out and vote,” he said. “Get every one of your friends, family members that are going to vote for Republicans, get there get out to vote.”

Federal judge bars some poll worker conduct after claims of intimidation of Black voters at Texas site
From CNN's Tierney Sneed
A federal judge barred poll workers at an election site in Beaumont, Texas, from engaging in certain conduct that Black voters said was intimidating.
US District Judge Michael J. Truncale, of the Eastern District of Texas, issued the temporary restraining order Monday in a case brought by Beaumont’s chapter of the NAACP, which alleged that White poll workers spoke aggressively to Black voters, hovered too close behind Black voters while the voters operated voting machines, and declined to help Black voters cast their ballots.
Truncale prohibited poll workers in Jefferson County from engaging in the specific behaviors outlined in the NAACP complaint. However, he rejected the NAACP’s request that he remove the official who is presiding as the election judge at the voting site where the conduct allegedly occurred.
The lawsuit put forward declarations from several poll workers, voters and a local pastor who had been at the election site, a community center where a vast majority of voters are Black. They said they witnessed White poll workers aggressively demand that Black voters loudly recite their addresses, even after those voters’ identities had been confirmed, while making no such demands of White voters. 
They also alleged that the White poll watchers and workers were following Black voters to the voting machines and standing close enough behind the votes that they could watch them mark their ballots. Additionally they said that the White poll workers refused to help Black voters insert their ballots into a ballot scanning machine, while giving that assistance to White voters.
“I witnessed White poll watchers standing so close to voters at the polling booth that they could watch the voters marking their ballots,” a poll worker said in a declaration. “The poll watcher was not even two feet away from the voter. This happened twice over the course of the afternoon. On each occasion, the voter was Black and appeared intimidated by the behavior of the poll watchers. I had to ask the poll watcher to step back and stop looking at the voter’s ballot as it was being completed.”
Airon Reynolds, a pastor of a local church who is Black, attested that he had tried to talk the Mary Beth Bowling, the election judge, and county clerk Laurie Leister last week about the alleged behavior. He said Bowling refused his request that she change her behavior and that Leister would also not direct Bowling to stop the conduct.
Attorneys for the county officials did not respond to CNN’s request for comment.

Voters in Philadelphia suburb say issues of crime, economy and abortion drove them to the polls
Brittany Castor (CNN)
Voters in Bensalem, in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, told CNN what motivated them to get out and vote in today's midterm elections, including issues around the economy, crime and abortion.
Rosanne and Jack Payson have lived in the Philadelphia suburb for 45 years.
""I don't like Donald Trump. Voting for a Republican like Mastriano means that we're going to have more trouble,"" Jack Payson told CNN's Jason Carroll.
GOP gubernatorial candidate Doug Mastriano is facing Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro in the governor's race.
Rosanne Payson said the Supreme Court ruling on Roe v. Wade is one of the issues that motivated her to vote.
""The Roe issue bothers me. I think women should be able to choose. ... It is not simply that they don't want the child and they want an abortion, there's other issues involved,"" she said.
Pennsylvania voter Brittany Castor said she identifies as a Republican and has voted for candidates in both parties in her life, but the issue of a woman's right to choose ""absolutely"" drove her to the polls this year.
Joseph and Susan O'Rourke said that crime, the economy and the border are the key issues for them.
Joseph O'Rourke said that GOP Senate candidate Mehmet Oz has spoken well about those three issues. On the gubernatorial side, he said while ""I don't think we have a good selection,"" he voted for Mastriano.
""If you listen to Mastriano, he is all law enforcement and everything, but then Josh Shapiro was the attorney general so, you know, it's a difficult choice to make,"" he said. 
He added that, like other swing voters in Bucks County, he voted for former Presidents Barack Obama and Donald Trump, and then voted for President Biden.
On swing voters in Pennsylvania, voter Jack Payson said, ""I really think that it is good that people are flexible, that they should take into account all of the issues, that they should have the right to change their mind."" 
Voter William Castelberg Jr. said that crime and the economy brought him to the polls.
""Crime is big, you know, it's really big in the city of Philadelphia. I would hate to see it come to the suburbs here in Bucks County. The second thing is inflation. You know, there's so many people that can't afford day to day, it's sad,"" he told Carroll. 
Here are some demographics of the state:

This Georgia resident says he voted for candidates who would protect his rights as a gay man
From CNN's Aditi Sangal
Moving to the state of Georgia changed how former New York resident Andy Hill perceived the importance of his vote.
""I lived in New York previously, and it never seemed urgent to vote for my own rights in New York. But it seems urgent here,"" he told CNN, acknowledging the important of voting in the battleground state.
Hill voted at an Atlanta polling station on Tuesday morning.
As a seminary student, he said what drives him to vote is whether or not the government protects basic human rights.
""I saw what the Supreme Court did to women's right in the last term, and it made me really concerned as a gay man that they're not going to be standing up for my rights in the next term if that comes up for debate,"" he said. ""So I want to make sure the people who are in the office both at the state level and federal level have my rights in mind and are interested in protecting my rights.""

NY Gov. Hochul on crime: Zeldin only has ""soundbites"" while she has demonstrated ""sound policy""
From CNN's Kristina Sgueglia

During her first public campaign event on Election Day, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul stumped with local leaders at an Upper East Side subway station in New York City, where she talked about one of the hottest-button issues: crime.
Hochul said crime — a major point in opponent Rep. Lee Zeldin’s campaign — is ultimately not a campaign issue for her because she’s been working on it during her tenure as governor already. 
“The difference is soundbites versus actually sound policy. It's real easy to get out there stand on a street corner and scream about crime, but when you oppose every single sensible gun safety piece of legislation that we have put forward here in the state, but also when you had a chance to stand up in Congress for the first meaningful gun safety legislation bipartisan – other Republicans voted for this – he could not even do that. He didn’t bother to show up in Congress to vote to fund the police – so the record is clear,” she said, according to CNN affiliate NY1.
“We’re working on it; he talks about it,” Hochul added.
“If they are thinking Lee Zeldin is going to defend democracy when he had a chance to stand up and call out the insurrectionists, what did he do that day? He went and blamed the Democrats and voted against certifying Joe Biden as our president. That’s how you subvert democracy. That’s exhibit A of subverting democracy,” Hochul said.
Hochul also said she and New York City Mayor Eric Adams are “partners” in fighting crime.
“This is not an election issue for me. ... We said we're going to partner together, for the first time the governor of New York will actually be engaged in helping the mayor of the city. That relationship has only grown stronger; you can ask Mayor Adams himself,” she said. 
Hochul appeared with Rep. Carolyn Maloney, Rep. Jerry Nadler, state Sen. Liz Krueger, Assembly member Rebecca Seawright and Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine at the 86th Street station.
Asked if there is anything New Yorkers might not know about her, she said it might be “how tough I am.”
“I call myself a street fighter from Buffalo. I have had to come up through a lot of tough knocks, as a lot of women do. You have to break down a lot of barriers, but that makes you stronger, makes you tougher to be able to handle the challenges,” Hochul said.
“There is nothing I can’t handle” she continued, adding the election has “elevated” her strength and desire to serve New York.

Philadelphia officials add process to catch double votes, but it's likely to slow election results
From CNN's Fredreka Schouten, Jason Carroll and Linh Tran

Philadelphia election officials voted Tuesday morning to reestablish a process that’s intended to catch double votes – in a move that is likely to slow down reporting of election results from the largest city in this battleground state.
The decision to reinstitute the often-tedious process, known as poll book reconciliation, could focus national attention on Philadelphia if the consequential US Senate race between Democrat John Fetterman and Republican Mehmet Oz is close. 
The process compares mail ballots with poll books from Election Day to ensure people have not voted twice.
The 2-1 vote by the Philadelphia city commissioner early Tuesday follows a lawsuit from a Republican group that alleged Philadelphia was inviting double votes with a plan to scale back on poll book reconciliation. Although Judge Anne Marie B. Coyle ruled against the Republican organization, she also criticized the move by city election officials to change the poll book process as “erroneous.”
A Philadelphia city election official told CNN that the elections board voted to reinstate the process Tuesday out of an abundance of caution in order to avoid any appearance of impropriety.
The official said they had intended not to use the process because they had not encountered any double votes over the course of the last three elections, and they wanted the process to move along more quickly. 
Although they were not required to reinstate it because of the Republican lawsuit, the official said, but chose to do so to quell any questions that may arise after the fact. They did not want even the perception that they are doing anything wrong, the official said, but they questioned why Philadelphia was the only city to be sued by the Republican group.
During Tuesday’s meeting, Seth Bluestein, the sole Republican on the commission, said that when questions arise about delays in Philadelphia results, it’s because “Republicans targeted Philadelphia … to force us to do a procedure no other county does.”
Bluestein and Lisa Deeley, the Democratic chair of the board, voted to reinstate the procedure. Democrat Omar Sabir voted against it.
The action comes as Philadelphia and other jurisdictions in Pennsylvania grapple with another Election Day issue: The risk of thousands of mail-in ballots being rejected because of missing or incomplete handwritten dates on the return envelope.

Voters in Mercer County, New Jersey, are voting manually due to machine problems
From CNN's Katie Lobosco
Voters in Mercer County, New Jersey, are having to vote manually Tuesday morning due to a problem with the voting machines. The county is home to Princeton, Trenton, Ewing and Lawrence Township.
“No one will be disenfranchised and we are working on fixing the issue at present. It may delay results but we will make sure everyone votes,” said Mercer County Clerk Paula Sollami Covello in an email to CNN. 
The results will likely be tallied later than usual, but Covello did not rule out the possibility that the ballots voted manually could still be tallied Tuesday night. 
The county has Dominion, the machine maker, and other IT professionals coming to fix the problem. Poll workers are on hand to walk voters through the process. 
“There is an issue with our Dominion scanners not reading throughout the county. There is a slot on the top of the scanner and voters can vote — and are voting manually,” Covello added. “No voter should walk away. They can vote manually.”
Voters can and should still go to their respective polling locations. Their ballot will be inserted into the ""emergency slot"" in the machine, according to an alert posted by Princeton, a town in Mercer County.

A single winning ticket for the $2.04 billion Powerball jackpot was sold in California

 — 
A lone winning ticket for the record $2.04 billion Powerball lottery jackpot was sold in Altadena, California, lottery officials said Tuesday, making the lucky ticket holder the winner of the largest lottery prize ever.
The ticket was sold at a Joe’s Service Center, the California Lottery said on Twitter. Results posted to Powerball.com similarly said there was one winner who matched all six numbers in California – the odds of which were 1 in 292.2 million, according to the Multi-State Lottery Association.
The winning numbers, which were announced Tuesday morning after Monday night’s drawing was delayed, were 10-33-41-47-56 and the Powerball was 10, according to the association.
And while you likely weren’t the jackpot winner, lotteries are urging players to check their tickets on the chance you won one of the other – albeit smaller – prizes: Per the Multi-State Lottery Association, more than 11.2 million tickets won cash prizes totaling $98.1 million, including 22 tickets that won $1 million prizes for matching the five white numbers but not the Powerball.

The jackpot was a record $1.9 billion but grew to $2.04 billion by the time of the drawing, the association said in a statement, “making it the world’s largest lottery prize” – just as its organizers intended when they changed the odds in 2015.
In fact, the jackpot was so large that California lottery officials didn’t have the appropriate signage: At the gas station where the winning ticket was sold, just northeast of Los Angeles, they taped a “B” onto signs that read, “Millionaire made here,” so they would instead read, “Billionaire made here.”
The winner has yet to come forward, said Carolyn Becker, a spokesperson for the California lottery, adding, “Somebody is holding on to a very important piece of paper this morning.”
The ticket did, however, make one millionaire: Joseph Chahayed, the owner of the gas station, was awarded his own $1 million for being the retailer who sold the winning ticket.
Joseph Chahayed is the shop owner who sold the winning Powerball ticket. Chahayed now receives a $1 million bonus check.

Chahayed, who came to the US from Syria in 1980 with his wife and two children, told reporters he arrived at the gas station Tuesday morning to find California lottery officials waiting for him.
“They said, ‘Congratulations, your station sent a winner,’” he said, adding he hoped the winner lived in the neighborhood. The grandfather of 11 also said he was happy the lottery benefited California schools.
The announcement of a winner Tuesday came after officials delayed the drawing Monday night, due to what the Multi-State Lottery Association called a “technical issue.”
The association initially said overnight the delay was caused when one participating lottery needed more time to process its sales and play data, echoing an earlier statement by the California Lottery, which said one lottery needed additional time to complete the necessary security protocols.
On Tuesday afternoon, the Minnesota Lottery announced its sales verification system caused a processing delay, prompting the postponement of the drawing.
“The delay was necessary to confirm the Powerball drawing could be conducted securely and accurately,” the Minnesota Lottery release said. “At no time was the integrity of the process compromised.”
All 48 participating lotteries are required to submit their sales and plays before the winning numbers can be selected, the Multi-State Lottery Association said in a statement overnight. “Powerball has stringent security requirements to protect the integrity of the game and remains committed to holding a drawing that gives all players a fair chance to win,” the association said.
“Like the rest of America, Powerball is eager to hold its drawing for the world record jackpot,” the association said in a follow-up statement Tuesday morning before the drawing, “however, protecting the integrity of the draw is of upmost importance, even if that means a further delay,” the statement early Tuesday said, urging players to hold on to their tickets.
According to the Multi-State Lottery Association, Tuesday’s jackpot was hit on the 41st draw of the run, marking the sixth time the Powerball jackpot was hit in 2022. The last Powerball jackpot was won on August 3 in Pennsylvania.
Why is the Powerball prize at a record? Thank Fed Chairman Jerome Powell
The largest Powerball jackpot ever won was in January 2016, when three winners split a prize advertised at $1.586 billion. Each took their share of the cash value, which added up to $983.5 million.
Powerball draws take place every Monday, Wednesday and Saturday at 10:59 p.m. ET.
Powerball is played by charging $2 per ticket and having players choose five white balls between the numbers 1 to 69 and a red Powerball from the numbers 1 to 26. If a player gets all six numbers correct, they win the massive jackpot.
The odds of winning the jackpot by matching all 5 numbers and the Powerball number are one in 292.2 million.
Prior to 2015, though, the white balls were numbered 1 to 59 and the Powerball was numbered 1 to 35. The change means that now gamblers have better odds of winning small prizes but worse odds of winning the jackpot, making it more likely that the big number will grow to record sizes.

What we covered here
Control of Senate and House still hang in the balance: It's too early to call key races — including in Nevada, Georgia, Wisconsin and Arizona — that could determine which party controls the chambers. Dozens of governorships, secretaries of states and attorneys general are also on the line.
First Senate flip of the night: Democrat John Fetterman will win Pennsylvania's Senate seat, CNN projects, and defeat Trump-backed Republican Mehmet Oz. The pick up is a big boost to Democrats' hopes of clinging to the Senate as the red wave that Republicans hoped for has yet to materialize in the House.
Historic firsts: Both parties are diversifying their ranks. Here's a look at the candidates CNN projects will make history.

Get up to speed on what you need to know on the US midterm elections before polls close tonight

If you're just joining us, here's what you need to know to get up to speed on the state of the midterms race and what to watch for next.
What's at stake: The 2022 midterm elections will decide control of Congress, dozens of statewide positions and ballot measures on key issues in many states.
Take a look at CNN's hour-by-hour guide on when polls close for each state.
What the results could mean for America: At every election, candidates tell voters that this is the most critical election of their lifetimes. This time they may be right.
A Republican wave would sweep in scores of candidates who swear by ex-President Donald Trump’s false claims that the 2020 election was stolen. The former President would likely weaponize a Republican-controlled House against Biden ahead of the 2024 presidential vote; Rep. Kevin McCarthy – who would likely become Republican Speaker if Republicans win – has not ruled out impeaching Biden, despite the absence of any evidence that he’s committed an impeachable offense.
A surprise Democratic victory would allow Biden to build upon his social, health, and climate change legislation, and to balance out the judiciary with liberal judges after four years of Trump’s conservative picks.
Joining us from abroad? If you're following the US midterm elections from another part of the world, read this helpful guide on what to know and what to watch.
What to look for tonight: Watch Harry Enten's quick explainer ahead of Election Night to get up to speed:

McCarthy is confident GOP will take back the House

House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy and his team have been working on a victory speech for the last couple of weeks as he remains extremely confident that they will take back the House tonight.
While he has prepared remarks, he's expected to riff a bit as well. His team expects he may take the stage in the 11 p.m. ET hour if the night goes as they expect.
It's expected that Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel and potentially former House Speaker Newt Gingrich could speak as well. 
McCarthy has raised an enormous amount of money and stumped in about 40 states in the last few months — even as late as last night and today for two House challengers in Virginia, Jen Kiggans and Hung Cao, who Republicans believe will help them take back the majority.
The goal for Team McCarthy: Picking up at least 20 seats. If they clear that bar, they will consider it a very good night, giving them a comfortable governing majority. If the party picks up fewer, Republicans won't be view tonight as strong of a showing as they hoped. which could spell problems for getting their agenda through Congress.

Official: Detroit e-poll books have isolated issues, but hard copies of voter registrations list are available
From CNN's Annie Grayer and Nicki Brown
There have been isolated incidents of e-poll books going down in Detroit, Michigan, according to Jake Rollow, a spokesperson for Michigan Department of State.
Rollow explained: E-poll books are laptops that have a static download of the voter registration list. When voters arrive at their polling place, election workers check them in on an e-poll book to ensure they're registered, in the right precinct, and haven't already voted absentee. Polling sites have hardcopy paper backups to check in voters.
Rollow said he has heard a ""couple reports"" that e-poll books in Detroit have gone down, but ""not that many.""
Detroit NAACP sent a notice saying there are some polling locations that are ""experiencing computer glitches,"" but reminded voters to stay in line because they can still check in via a backup paper poll book and vote with paper ballots.
Kristina Karamo, the GOP nominee for Michigan Secretary of State, tweeted misinformation on Tuesday, claiming that there was “fraud” and a “crime” in Detroit because some voters who showed up to their precincts were told they already voted absentee.
Former President Donald Trump already picked up Karamo’s claim, and said on his Truth Social account, “the absentee ballot situation in Detroit is REALLY BAD. People are showing up to Vote only to be told, “sorry, you have already voted.” This is happening in large numbers, elsewhere as well. Protest, Protest, Protest.”
But remember: Rollow from the Michigan Secretary of State’s office has already addressed this and said the issue had already been resolved.
Every precinct should have a paper backup of the voter registration list in case there are issues with the e-poll book, Rollow said. ""It obviously could take a bit longer just to look somebody up on paper rather than looking them up on your computer, but it shouldn't impact a voter's ability to vote in any way.""
""There's no reason to expect that it would be, you know, taking place more broadly or in any way, you know, connected across jurisdictions,"" Rollow said, adding that officials would look into the issue to make sure.
As of 8 a.m. local time this morning, 2,016,147 absentee ballots had been requested in Michigan, and 1,716,264 had been submitted, Rollow added.

Judge orders polls in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania, to stay open until 10 p.m. ET
From CNN's Jessica Schneider
Polls in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania, will stay open until 10 p.m. ET tonight, per an order from county judge Lesa S. Gelb.
In the order, Gelb said voters in the county were “disenfranchised and denied the fundamental right to vote … through no fault of their own.”
Attorneys petitioning for the extension of time cited a paper shortage at polling locations, that ultimately resulted in the inability to print paper ballots and necessitated the use of emergency and provisional ballots, resulting in delays for voters.
The judge ordered that all election officials be immediately alerted to the extended voting hours.
Luzerne County is located in Northeast Pennsylvania, and encompasses Wilkes-Barre, the county’s largest city.

Closing time extended for 3 polling precincts in North Carolina after they opened late on Election Day
From CNN's Melissa Alonso 
The North Carolina Board of Elections voted unanimously to allow three polling precincts to close an hour later in North Carolina after their opening was delayed on Election Day.
Wilson County's Sanoca Fire Station, the Gaddys Community Building polling precinct in Robeson County and the Ransom precinct in Columbus County will all close at 8:30 p.m. ET, the board voted. 
Voters would vote with provisional ballot after 7:30 p.m. ET, said the board during a meeting Tuesday on the issue.
We're ""talking about less than a half dozen precincts today and there's over 2,600 precincts here in North Carolina. So, what we're about to do is just to make sure that polling places are open no more and no less than the statutory. The statutes require us,"" said Damon Circosta, chair of the North Carolina Board of Elections ahead of the vote.
Extending the closing ""offers consistency amongst all three of those precincts and it makes sure that we're not staying. Keeping our election workers there so terribly late at night, so it's balancing the needs of the voters with the needs of election administration,"" said the chair.
The Gaddys Community Building polling place in Robeson County ""opened approximately one hour late because the building was locked and the voters did not have the correct access code to enter the building,"" North Carolina State Board of Elections (NCSBE) Executive Director Karen Brinson Bell said. 
""Additionally, three sites in Columbus County were delayed in opening due to the check-in computers not being connected properly to the printers and therefore the workers were unable to print the voters' authorization to vote forms,"" she said. 
NCSBE will start releasing initial results at approximately 7:30 p.m. ET for all counties where the polls close at that time. 
In all less than 45 voters were impacted and several returned or were offered provisional ballots, according to the board.

Voting ""reconciliation"" process could delay counting ballots in Philadelphia

An extra verification process to ensure voters didn’t vote both by mail and in person could delay counting ballots and getting election results in Philadelphia, a spokesperson for the Philadelphia City Commissioners told CNN on Tuesday.
“We’re going to go as fast as we can go; I don’t think anybody knows yet” when the count will be done, Kevin Feeley, a spokesperson for the commissioners’ office told CNN. 
Philadelphia elections officials have received around 120,000 mail-in ballots so far — a much smaller number than the over 350,000 mail-in ballots they counted during the 2020 general election, Feeley said, adding that means it will likely not take as long to count and verify the votes as the 2020 election did.
Some background: Delays could happen because the city commissioners voted Tuesday morning for elections officials to do what’s known as a “reconciliation process” during the Election Day count – where elections officials check to make sure voters who voted by mail also didn’t show up to vote in person. Other counties do the reconciliation process after votes are tallied.
“That’s probably going to be sometime tomorrow, the reconciliation,” Feeley told CNN. “And that impacts when we’re finished. We’re going to go as fast as we can go; we’re going to have shifts working around the clock.”

Voter check-in briefly delayed in Illinois county, clerk says, after IT team fended off apparent cyberattack
From CNN's Sean Lyngaas
An apparent cyberattack on the website of the clerk of Champaign County, Illinois, caused a brief delay in the clerk’s ability to access their registration information on Tuesday morning but did not prevent anyone from voting, County Clerk Aaron Ammons told CNN.
“We haven’t had to turn anyone away,” Ammons said, adding that the issue had been mitigated by early Tuesday afternoon. “We’ve had the inability for certain sites to pull up our voter registration program. It would give us an error message on connectivity.”
It’s unclear who was responsible for the apparent hack. Ammon said his IT team has been fending off hacks for the last month that try to knock their website offline. Voters should know that their ability to cast a ballot has not affected by the incident, he added. Champaign County is in east central Illinois.
“Please stay in line!” Champaign County said on its Facebook page. “Election judges and staff are doing everything they can to process voters according to the requirements of election law while navigating these attacks."" 
The incident is an example of the unpredictable events on Election Day that federal, state and local officials have long been drilling for. Local government websites are not involved in tallying votes but typically provide voting information to the public.
At a briefing with reporters Tuesday, CISA officials said they hadn’t heard about the apparent attack but would look into it.

White House moves to get ahead of blame game by highlighting Biden's agenda
From CNN's Phil Mattingly

As Democrats brace for midterm losses, the intra-party blame is game set to boil over in the weeks ahead, prompting the White House to separate President Joe Biden and his agenda from the list of targets. 
The White House circulated an Election Day memo to allies underscoring that more than two dozen individual poll results demonstrate the popularity of the key individual elements of Biden’s agenda, ranging from his cornerstone legislative achievements to his actions on student loans, marijuana and his administration’s response to Covid-19.
“Before all the votes have even been cast, pundits are declaring that these midterms have been a referendum on the President’s agenda – nothing could be further from the truth,” the memo, which was obtained by CNN, says in its introduction.
Yet even Biden has acknowledged that his agenda, no matter how it polls in isolation, hasn’t translated to an American public that has taken a largely negative view on the direction of the country. “We’ve passed so many good things ... people haven’t realized how good they are yet,” he said at a fundraising event last week.
The effort to get in front of expected losses comes after months of frontline Democratic candidates actively seeking to separate themselves from Biden. It’s a reality advisors say Biden doesn’t take personally. After 36 years in the Senate, Biden’s view has long been that the candidates know what’s best for their state or district. But as Biden’s approval ratings started to inch up in the last few months, White House officials have bristled at the view that he was a singular drag on Democrats. 
Instead, they have pointed to the combination of history and economic headwinds. Nearly all of Biden’s recent predecessors that one-party control of Washington faced major midterm losses. The fact Americans have faced persistent inflation near four-decade highs only compounds the political difficulty.

Nicole has become a tropical storm -- with scattered showers impacting parts of Florida this midterm Election Day -- and is expected to strengthen more before slamming the state's east coast early Thursday as the first hurricane to strike the United States in November in nearly 40 years. CNN meteorologist Chad Myers has more.

Elizabeth Holmes’ request for a new trial is denied

 — 
A federal judge has denied Elizabeth Holmes’ request for a new trial, according to court filings on Monday, paving the way for the founder of failed blood testing startup Theranos to be sentenced later this month.
The decision comes weeks after an October 17 hearing held in San Jose, during which Judge Edward Davila had Adam Rosendorff, one of the government’s key witnesses, take the stand again. The hearing was to address concerns from Holmes’ defense team, which claimed Rosendorff had shown up at her home after the trial concluded asking to speak with her and expressed regrets about his testimony.
Elizabeth Holmes asks court for a new trial after alleging a key witness has regrets
At that hearing in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, Rosendorff, a former Theranos lab director, reaffirmed the truthfulness of his testimony at Holmes’ trial and said that the government did not influence what he said.
In his decision on Monday, Davila denied all three of Holmes’ motions requesting a new trial. A sentencing hearing, previously scheduled for last month, is now set for November 18.
Holmes, once hailed as a tech industry icon for her company’s promises to test for a range of conditions with just a few drops of blood, was found guilty in January on four charges of defrauding investors. Ramesh “Sunny” Balwani, her ex-boyfriend and former COO at Theranos, was convicted in a separate trial in July. Both face up to 20 years in prison as well as a fine of $250,000 plus restitution for each count.
In September, Holmes’ defense team filed a motion asking for a new trial, after claiming that Rosendorff arrived at Holmes’ home on August 8. According to that court filing, Rosendorff did not interact with Holmes but did speak to her partner Billy Evans, who recounted the exchange in an email to Holmes’ lawyers shortly after.
In Evans’ email, he wrote that Rosendorff “said when he was called as a witness he tried to answer the questions honestly but that the prosecutors tried to make everybody look bad.” The former Theranos lab director also “said he felt like he had done something wrong,” Evans wrote.
Davila wrote in his order Monday that the court “finds that the statements Dr. Rosendorff made to Mr. Evans do not stand for any of the proposed meanings that Defendant would want and, even if they did, they would not be material to the issues” at trial.
“Accordingly, a new trial is not warranted based on the ‘newly discovered’ evidence of Dr. Rosendorff’s statements to Mr. Evans,” Davila wrote.
In a sworn declaration filed with the court on September 21, Rosendorff wrote that he stands by his testimony in the trials of Holmes and Balwani “in every respect.”
The rise and fall of Theranos: A timeline
During the hearing last month, Holmes and Evans were present as Rosendorff was asked by a defense lawyer about his decision to visit Holmes’ home. He responded that in the weeks and months following Holmes’ conviction he “started to feel increasingly distressed and uncomfortable at the prospect that a young child, an infant child, would spend their formative years without a mother in their life.” (Holmes has one child with Evans.)
Rosendorff said that when he visited Holmes’ residence in August, he rang the doorbell and spoke briefly to Evans, who asked him to leave. He went to his car and started to drive away, he testified, but Evans motioned for him to roll down his window; he did, and they had a conversation, Rosendorff said, in which he “expressed sympathy for the rank and file employees at Theranos.”
When asked by the defense lawyer whether he had said the prosecution was trying to make everyone look bad, Rosendorff said that the prosecution was trying to paint “an angry picture of Elizabeth Holmes. To the extent other people looked bad it was because of their association with Elizabeth.”
He said he did not recall telling Evans that he felt he had done something wrong, as Evans had written in his email to Holmes’ lawyers after their interaction.

 — 
It’s Election Day in America, and some companies are offering deals and freebies to mark the occasion, while others are giving employees time off to vote.
Election Day is not a national holiday, though it is a public holiday in some states, so some government offices may be closed. Less than half of US states require employers to give workers paid time off to vote, according to the Movement Advancement Project, an independent think tank.
Here’s what you can expect from Corporate America on Election Day, including what you can get for free, or at a discount, on Tuesday.
Doughnut, anyone?

Doughnuts
Krispy Kreme is giving out free glazed doughnuts Tuesday.
“A healthy, vibrant democracy depends on engaged citizens who vote,” David Skena, global chief brand officer at Krispy Kreme, said in a statement. “We’re happy to celebrate voters and our democracy by giving everyone a free Original Glazed doughnut on Election Day.”
Krispy Kreme has made a habit of giving its signature glazed doughnuts away. Last year, the company offered free doughnuts to people who have been vaccinated against Covid-19. As of June 2021 it had given away 1.5 million doughnuts.
Pizza
Pizza to the Polls is a group that, well, delivers pizza to the polls.
The organization started in 2016, after seeing reports of long lines at early voting sites. We “sent in delivery pizzas to feed the crowds,” according to the group’s website. “The feedback was immediate and immense: it fortified hungry voters in line, cheered up beleaguered poll workers and gave people a way to help out their communities.”
Six years later, the group is still going. And this year, it’s sending food trucks to polling sites in Philadelphia on Election Day.
“With so many individuals becoming more politically involved and looking forward to voting this year, it is critical that they are supported with a functioning civic engagement ecosystem,” said Amirah Noaman, executive director of Pizza to the Polls. “Feeding people and providing water keeps people in line to vote and keeps elections running smoothly, in addition to helping to bring more joy and celebration to this Election Day.”
Rides
Lyft is offering discounted rides on Election Day. Customers can use the code VOTE22 to get 50%, or up to $10, off when they use a Lyft rideshare, bikeshare or scooter on Tuesday. The offer is valid while polls are open.
“We believe that everyone’s voice — and vote — deserves to be heard, and transportation should never be a barrier,” the company said in a statement.
Stickers
All voters have a chance to get the coveted “I Voted” sticker, a badge of civic pride that gives them bragging rights for the rest of the day.
Changes to schedules
Across the country, some companies give workers flexibility on Election Day to go to the polls. Over 2,000 firms participate in Time to Vote, a nonpartisan group whose corporate members offer information about voting, give employes paid time off to vote or ban meetings on Election Day.
One Time to Vote member, the specialty outdoor retailer REI, will open stores two hours later than usual to give employees paid time to vote.
“No one should be forced to choose between going to work and participating in the democratic process,” Ben Steele, chief customer officer at REI Co-op, said in a statement.
But not all participating companies are changing store hours or closing their doors. To join Time to Vote, “your CEO or company leadership must pledge to ensure that your employees have the time they need to cast their ballots,” according to the group. “There is no ‘one approach fits all.’”

A single winning ticket for the $2.04 billion Powerball jackpot was sold in California

 — 
A lone winning ticket for the record $2.04 billion Powerball lottery jackpot was sold in Altadena, California, lottery officials said Tuesday, making the lucky ticket holder the winner of the largest lottery prize ever.
The ticket was sold at a Joe’s Service Center, the California Lottery said on Twitter. Results posted to Powerball.com similarly said there was one winner who matched all six numbers in California – the odds of which were 1 in 292.2 million, according to the Multi-State Lottery Association.
The winning numbers, which were announced Tuesday morning after Monday night’s drawing was delayed, were 10-33-41-47-56 and the Powerball was 10, according to the association.
And while you likely weren’t the jackpot winner, lotteries are urging players to check their tickets on the chance you won one of the other – albeit smaller – prizes: Per the Multi-State Lottery Association, more than 11.2 million tickets won cash prizes totaling $98.1 million, including 22 tickets that won $1 million prizes for matching the five white numbers but not the Powerball.

The jackpot was a record $1.9 billion but grew to $2.04 billion by the time of the drawing, the association said in a statement, “making it the world’s largest lottery prize” – just as its organizers intended when they changed the odds in 2015.
In fact, the jackpot was so large that California lottery officials didn’t have the appropriate signage: At the gas station where the winning ticket was sold, just northeast of Los Angeles, they taped a “B” onto signs that read, “Millionaire made here,” so they would instead read, “Billionaire made here.”
The winner has yet to come forward, said Carolyn Becker, a spokesperson for the California lottery, adding, “Somebody is holding on to a very important piece of paper this morning.”
The ticket did, however, make one millionaire: Joseph Chahayed, the owner of the gas station, was awarded his own $1 million for being the retailer who sold the winning ticket.
Joseph Chahayed is the shop owner who sold the winning Powerball ticket. Chahayed now receives a $1 million bonus check.
CNN/CNN
Chahayed, who came to the US from Syria in 1980 with his wife and two children, told reporters he arrived at the gas station Tuesday morning to find California lottery officials waiting for him.
“They said, ‘Congratulations, your station sent a winner,’” he said, adding he hoped the winner lived in the neighborhood. The grandfather of 11 also said he was happy the lottery benefited California schools.
The announcement of a winner Tuesday came after officials delayed the drawing Monday night, due to what the Multi-State Lottery Association called a “technical issue.”
The association initially said overnight the delay was caused when one participating lottery needed more time to process its sales and play data, echoing an earlier statement by the California Lottery, which said one lottery needed additional time to complete the necessary security protocols.
On Tuesday afternoon, the Minnesota Lottery announced its sales verification system caused a processing delay, prompting the postponement of the drawing.
“The delay was necessary to confirm the Powerball drawing could be conducted securely and accurately,” the Minnesota Lottery release said. “At no time was the integrity of the process compromised.”
All 48 participating lotteries are required to submit their sales and plays before the winning numbers can be selected, the Multi-State Lottery Association said in a statement overnight. “Powerball has stringent security requirements to protect the integrity of the game and remains committed to holding a drawing that gives all players a fair chance to win,” the association said.
“Like the rest of America, Powerball is eager to hold its drawing for the world record jackpot,” the association said in a follow-up statement Tuesday morning before the drawing, “however, protecting the integrity of the draw is of upmost importance, even if that means a further delay,” the statement early Tuesday said, urging players to hold on to their tickets.
According to the Multi-State Lottery Association, Tuesday’s jackpot was hit on the 41st draw of the run, marking the sixth time the Powerball jackpot was hit in 2022. The last Powerball jackpot was won on August 3 in Pennsylvania.
Why is the Powerball prize at a record? Thank Fed Chairman Jerome Powell
The largest Powerball jackpot ever won was in January 2016, when three winners split a prize advertised at $1.586 billion. Each took their share of the cash value, which added up to $983.5 million.
Powerball draws take place every Monday, Wednesday and Saturday at 10:59 p.m. ET.
Powerball is played by charging $2 per ticket and having players choose five white balls between the numbers 1 to 69 and a red Powerball from the numbers 1 to 26. If a player gets all six numbers correct, they win the massive jackpot.
The odds of winning the jackpot by matching all 5 numbers and the Powerball number are one in 292.2 million.
Prior to 2015, though, the white balls were numbered 1 to 59 and the Powerball was numbered 1 to 35. The change means that now gamblers have better odds of winning small prizes but worse odds of winning the jackpot, making it more likely that the big number will grow to record sizes.
