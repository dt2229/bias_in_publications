Jeff Bezos Says He Will Give Away Most of His Fortune
The Amazon founder, estimated to be worth $124 billion, suggested in an interview on CNN that he would donate most of his money to charity in his lifetime, the first time he had made such a pledge.

Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, said he would give away most of his money to charity, making him the latest billionaire to pledge to donate his vast fortune during his lifetime.
Mr. Bezos is the world’s fourth-richest person, worth $124 billion, according to Bloomberg. In an interview with CNN released on Monday, Mr. Bezos, appearing with his girlfriend, the former television anchor Lauren Sanchez, said they were making preparations “to be able to give away this money.”
He said he wanted to give in a way that maximized the impact of the donations. “It’s really hard,” he said. “And there are a bunch of ways, I think, that you could do ineffective things.”
It was the first time that Mr. Bezos announced that he would give away the bulk of his wealth. More than 230 of the richest people in the world have promised to donate their money to charitable causes as part of the Giving Pledge, a philanthropy movement started in 2010.
At least as far back as the 19th-century financier George Peabody, many ultrawealthy Americans have given away large shares of their fortunes. Andrew Carnegie famously wrote in his influential 1889 treatise, “The Gospel of Wealth,” that “the man who dies thus rich dies disgraced.” Like Mr. Bezos at Amazon, Carnegie was frequently criticized for the labor conditions at his company.
More on Big Tech
Widespread Layoffs: Hiring the best, the brightest and the highest number of employees was a badge of honor at tech companies. Not anymore as layoffs surge.
Meta’s Job Cuts: The parent of Facebook said it was laying off more than 11,000 people, or about 13 percent of its work force, in what amounted to the company’s most significant job cuts.
Seeking Alternatives: Since Elon Musk bought Twitter, some of its users have sought out other social media platforms. Here is a closer look at Mastodon, one of the most popular alternatives.
An Empire in Danger: U.S. lawmakers’ objections to an obscure Chinese semiconductor company and tough Covid-19 restrictions are hurting Apple’s ability to make new iPhones in China.
The New York Times reported on Monday that Amazon plans to lay off approximately 10,000 people in corporate and technology jobs starting as soon as this week, in what would be the largest job cuts in the company’s history. Mr. Bezos’ wealth, which as recently as last year was more than $200 billion, according to Bloomberg, has fallen by tens of billions, on paper, because it is closely tied to Amazon’s share price, which has suffered along with other technology stocks this year.
Mr. Bezos, who is the executive chairman of Amazon, stepped down as chief executive in 2021 when he said his goal was “have the time and energy” to focus on his philanthropy and other pursuits. Mr. Bezos also owns The Washington Post and has his own space travel company, Blue Origin.
On Saturday, Mr. Bezos and Ms. Sanchez announced a $100 million grant for the singer and philanthropist Dolly Parton to direct to her chosen charitable causes, as part of an annual gift called the Bezos Award for Courage and Civility. Before Ms. Parton, $100 million awards were given to the chef José Andrés and the CNN commentator and activist Van Jones, announced by Mr. Bezos at the news conference after his trip in July 2021 aboard a rocket sent to outer space by Blue Origin.
In 2020, Mr. Bezos pledged to give $10 billion to combat climate change as part of the Bezos Earth Fund. As part of that commitment, Mr. Bezos pledged $2 billion to restore natural habitats and transform food systems at the climate summit in Glasgow last year. Previously, Mr. Bezos’ largest donation was a $2 billion gift to help homeless families and start preschools.
Mr. Bezos did not give many details in the CNN interview about how he would donate money, but his past efforts might provide some clues, said Stacy Palmer, the editor of The Chronicle of Philanthropy.
“This is a giant statement, not just because of the amount of wealth he has, but because he might really have a ripple effect on what others choose to do,” Ms. Palmer said.
But Mr. Bezos’ comment about giving away his fortune was “not a binding promise,” said Maribel Morey, a philanthropy expert and founding executive director of the Miami Institute for the Social Sciences. “We run to make news of promises, but we actually don’t know if that’s going to materialize.”
In 1999, the Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and his wife at the time, Melinda French Gates, helped usher in a new era of billionaire philanthropy with enormous donations to their namesake foundation. Their close friend Warren E. Buffett, the prominent investor, announced in 2006 that he would give a significant slice of his Berkshire Hathaway shares, valued at the time at $31 billion, to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. The three then started the Giving Pledge, where billionaires promise to give away at least half their fortunes, as a way to encourage greater generosity among the world’s richest people.
Other signatories have included Michael R. Bloomberg, then the mayor of New York; Mr. Gates’s Microsoft co-founder, Paul Allen; and Mark Zuckerberg, the Facebook chief executive, and his wife, Dr. Priscilla Chan. There are 236 pledgers across 28 countries, according to the Giving Pledge’s website.
Mr. Bezos has been criticized for not signing the Giving Pledge. His ex-wife, the author and philanthropist MacKenzie Scott, signed the pledge in 2019 after their divorce, vowing to “keep at it until the safe is empty.”
Ms. Scott, who is estimated by Bloomberg to be worth $24 billion, has already met the Giving Pledge threshold by giving away more than half her fortune — and she has done it in less than three and half years since first publishing her promise on the group’s website.
She has donated more than $14 billion to causes ranging from education to mental health. Ms. Scott, who recently filed for divorce from her second husband, has given to more than 1,500 groups.
Ms. Scott’s rapid, prolific giving is at times compared with Mr. Bezos’ own philanthropy, often to his detriment. Last month, Mr. Bezos visited the Vatican to receive a philanthropy award even though, many observers noted, his ex-wife had given away more money than he had. Unlike Mr. Bezos, who appears at events and gives speeches highlighting his giving, Ms. Scott has maintained a low profile, refusing all interviews on the subject and restricting her comments to essays that she posts on the website Medium.
On Monday, Ms. Scott released her latest essay, noting that over the past seven months she had given nearly $2 billion to 343 organizations. Some of those gifts, like $122.6 million to Big Brothers Big Sisters of America, had been previously announced. Others, like a $15 million gift to the Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service, were first revealed in the post. Like many of her gifts, the donation to the 83-year-old nonprofit group, which supports refugees and migrants entering the United States, was the largest in its history.
Ms. Scott began her latest essay with a poem by Gwen Nell Westerman that she said “inspires me by shutting me up every time I read it.”

Nov. 14, 2022
William J. Burns, the director of the Central Intelligence Agency, met with his Russian counterpart in Turkey on Monday to warn Russia against the use of nuclear weapons in Ukraine, a White House spokesman said.
The talks in Ankara — the highest level face-to-face meetings between senior Russian and American officials since Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine in February — were seen as part of the administration’s efforts to step up its communications with senior officials in Russia, which has made numerous veiled threats about using a nuclear weapon in Ukraine.
The National Security Council said the meeting was not in any way to negotiate or to discuss any settlement of the war in Ukraine. Ukraine was briefed in advance on the trip, the spokesman said.
President Biden has insisted that Ukraine, and not the United States, will dictate if and when negotiations commence to end the war. But a disagreement has emerged at the highest levels of the U.S. government over whether to press Ukraine to seek a diplomatic end to the war with Russia, with America’s top general, Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, urging in closed-door meetings that Ukraine should negotiate to cement its recent gains.
In a post on the messaging app Telegram on Monday, Gen. Valeriy Zaluzhny, the commander of the Ukrainian military, said he had spoken to General Milley and reiterated the country’s position on possible negotiations: Russia must withdraw before any talks are possible.
The State of the War
Retaking Kherson: On Nov. 11, Ukrainian soldiers swept into the southern city of Kherson, which Russian forces had occupied for more than eight months, seizing a major symbolic and strategic prize and dealing a bitter blow to Russia’s president, Vladimir V. Putin.
What’s Next?: Cheering crowds greeted Ukrainian forces as they entered Kherson, but analysts agree that the war is far from over. Here’s a look at what might lie ahead.
Winter Looms: Many analysts and diplomats have suggested there could be a pause in major combat over the winter. But after pushing the Russians out of Kherson, Ukraine has no desire to stop.
Peace Talks: While Gen. Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has made the case that the Ukrainians should try to cement their gains at the bargaining table, some U.S. officials say that peace talks remain a distant prospect.
“The Ukrainian military will not accept any negotiations, agreements or compromise decisions,” he wrote.
U.S. and European leaders see their goal for now as keeping the war contained to Ukraine and deterring President Vladimir V. Putin from using a tactical nuclear weapon or another weapon of mass destruction in the conflict. Mr. Putin has denied that Moscow is preparing to use a nuclear weapon in Ukraine, but senior American officials say that senior Russian military leaders have recently discussed the possibility of using a tactical nuclear weapon in the country.
Kommersant, a Russian business daily newspaper, reported on Monday that the Russian delegation in Ankara was headed by Sergei Naryshkin, the head of the country’s foreign intelligence service.
The Kremlin’s spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, confirmed to Tass, a Russian state news service, that a meeting had taken place. The meeting had been initiated by the United States, he said, but he would not disclose the topics discussed. A C.I.A. spokeswoman declined to comment; the agency never comments on the director’s travel.
Russian and Ukrainian officials have made separate public comments in recent weeks about potential peace negotiations, more than six months after their last known direct talks fell apart. But U.S. officials have said that they do not believe talks will begin soon and that both sides, for now, think that continued fighting will strengthen their eventual negotiating positions.
The National Security Council said that Mr. Burns had planned in the meeting raise the matter of Americans detained in Russia. The Biden administration has been trying to negotiate a prisoner swap with Russia to bring home the W.N.B.A. star Brittney Griner and Paul Whelan.
Ms. Griner has been detained in Russia since February after she flew into an airport near Moscow with a small amount of hashish oil in her luggage. She was sentenced in August to nine years in prison. Mr. Whelan was sentenced to a 16-year prison term on espionage charges by a Moscow court in 2020.
In August, American and Russian officials said they would use a special channel set up by Mr. Biden and Mr. Putin at their meeting in Geneva last year to negotiate over Ms. Griner and Mr. Whelan. U.S. officials have declined to divulge details of that channel. The Biden administration has offered to release Viktor Bout, a Russian arms dealer imprisoned in the United States, for the freedom of the two Americans.
Mr. Burns has previously been dispatched to interact with Russian officials over Ukraine. Before Mr. Putin ordered the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February, Mr. Burns flew to Moscow in November 2021 to tell Russian officials that the United States knew of the Russian plans and would forcefully respond to any invasion. Mr. Burns spoke by video to Mr. Putin, who was in Sochi at the time.

KYIV, Ukraine — Ukrainian and Russian forces traded fire on Monday from across the broad expanse of the Dnipro River that now divides them after Russia’s retreat from the southern city of Kherson, reshaping the battlefield with a victory that Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, declared marked “the beginning of the end of the war.”
The Dnipro has become the new front line in southern Ukraine, and officials there warned of continued danger from fighting in regions that have already endured months of Russian occupation.
Through the afternoon, artillery fire picked up in a southern district of the city near the destroyed Antonivsky Bridge over the Dnipro, stoking fears that the Russian Army would retaliate for the loss of the city with a bombardment from its new positions on the eastern bank.
Mortar shells struck near the bridge, sending up puffs of smoke. Near the riverfront, incoming rounds rang out with thunderous, metallic booms. It was not immediately possible to assess what had been hit.
The head of the Kherson regional military administration, Yaroslav Yanushevich, urged the tens of thousands of remaining residents in the city to evacuate while Ukrainian forces worked to clear land mines, hunt down Russian soldiers left behind and restore essential services.
The mines are a significant danger. Four people, including an 11-year-old, were killed when a family driving in the village of Novoraysk, outside the city, ran over a mine, Mr. Yanushevich said. Another mine injured six railway workers who were trying to restore service after lines were damaged. And there were at least four more children reportedly injured by mines across the region, Ukrainian officials said in statements.
The deaths underscored the threats still remaining on the ground, even as Mr. Zelensky made a surprise visit to Kherson, a tangible sign of Ukraine’s soaring morale.
“We are, step by step, coming to all of our country,” Mr. Zelensky said in a short appearance in the city’s main square on Monday, as hundreds of jubilant residents celebrated.
Russian forces continued to fire from across the river on towns and villages newly recaptured by Ukrainian forces, according to the Ukrainian military’s southern command. Two Russian missiles struck the town of Beryslav, which is just north of a critical dam, the military said. It was not immediately known if there were any casualties.
The Ukrainian government is setting up evacuation routes to the cities of Mykolaiv and Kryvyi Rih, said Iryna Vereshchuk, a Ukrainian deputy prime minister. “We will not have time to restore power supplies enough to heat homes where children, the sick and people with reduced mobility live,” she said. “It will not be a mass evacuation. It will cover those who are sick, the elderly and those left without care of their relatives.”
A senior U.S. military official said on Monday that Russian forces continued to target civilian infrastructure, although the pace of missile and drone strikes appeared to have slowed down some since the end of October.
On the Dnipro’s eastern bank, residents described an increasingly repressive environment as Russian soldiers poured into the area.
“Occupants rob local people and exchange stuff for samogon,” or homemade vodka, said one resident, Tatiana, who communicated via a secure messaging app from Oleshky, a town across the river from Kherson City. “Then they get drunk and even more aggressive. We are so scared here.” She asked that her surname be withheld for security.
Other residents on the eastern bank offered similar accounts of disorder and chaos.
“Russians roam around, identify the empty houses and settle there,” Ivan, 45, wrote in a text message. He lives in Skadovsk, which is south of Kherson city, and asked that his surname not be used out of concern for his safety. “We try to connect with the owners and to arrange for someone local to stay in their place. So that it is not abandoned and Russians don’t take it.”
Throughout the weekend, the Ukrainian military sought to target Russian forces as they tried to regroup after their retreat from Kherson. The Ukrainian air force launched strikes on the east side of the river, with the Ukrainian military saying it had fired on 33 Russian positions.

Residents of the newly reclaimed city of Kherson on Monday described months of brutality and mistreatment by Russian forces, including the theft of vehicles, beatings and detention for anyone suspected of opposing the nearly nine-month occupation.
In interviews, they described how the Russians rounded up residents, whether for their political views or because they were suspected of belonging to a partisan underground group.
At an open-air street market selling essentials like painkillers and toilet paper that were missing from shops, many residents offered stories of acquaintances detained, with some saying they’d heard of torture.
Vyacheslav Lukashuk, 27, a lanky handyman, said he had wound up face down on the floor of his living room after about a dozen soldiers burst into his home and beat him. They ended up holding him for seven days.
“All I did was write, ‘Glory to Ukraine’ in spray paint on a bus stop,” he said.
The worst abuse occurred in the first minutes, he said. A soldier slipped a plastic bag over his head and clasped it around his neck to suffocate him, and other soldiers kicked him and beat him with rifle butts, he said.
“They just flew in and started beating me,” Mr. Lukashuk said. “I said goodbye to my life at that moment.”

After he was taken to a jail, Mr. Lukashuk said, other detainees told him they were tortured with electrical shocks, and he could hear screams in the evenings. Mr. Lukashuk said that he was not tortured during his detainment, but that he did confess and apologize for the pro-Ukrainian graffiti — a confession that was posted online along with those of other residents who admitted to pro-Ukrainian activities or views, in an apparent effort to shame or humiliate them.
Mykhail Tkachov, a dealer at a lot that sold new cars and traded used vehicles, said Russian forces had claimed to be there for the residents’ protection but frequently stole from them, particularly targeting vehicles.
Mr. Tkachov said he and his colleagues had scattered an inventory of almost 200 cars across courtyards and street parking places around the city in the first days after the Russian Army arrived. But the Russians detained one of the dealers, and he revealed the locations and handed over the keys.
“People lived like shadows,” afraid to make their presence known, Mr. Tkachov said, while the Russian soldiers made themselves at home.
“I saw eight of them sitting in a cafe right on this street,” he said. “They drove up in civilian cars without license plates, obviously stolen from somebody.”
Serhiy Karasenko, selling home-pickled cauliflower, cabbage and tomatoes at a market stall, said Russian soldiers made off with his car last week, just before fleeing the city. He now carries his wares to the market by taxi. His car, he said, is “gone. I won’t see it again.”
Mr. Tkachov said some people’s cars were stolen at Russian checkpoints. Soldiers took them, ostensibly after finding problems with the Ukrainian registration documents, like a car not registered to the driver. The company-owned car of a friend, he said, was confiscated.
“It’s a business car,” Mr. Tkachov said the man told the soldiers. But he said the soldiers responded, “It’s our business now,” and took the car.

Zelensky Visits Newly Freed Kherson
“This war took the best heroes of our country,” President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine said during an unannounced visit to the newly recaptured city of Kherson.

KHERSON, Ukraine — President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine made an unannounced visit to the newly freed city of Kherson on Monday, reveling in perhaps the most significant success by his country’s forces since Russia’s full-scale invasion began in February.
“This is the beginning of the end of the war,” he said to a crowd of hundreds of people, some wrapped in Ukrainian flags.
The president’s visit to Kherson just days after it was retaken was a tangible sign of Ukraine’s soaring morale and its growing boldness in the nearly nine-month war. Kherson, a vital Black Sea port and a gateway to Crimea, was the first major city to fall to Russian forces after the start of the invasion on Feb. 24. Russia’s decision to withdraw was a major blow to the Kremlin and its ambition to conquer all of southern Ukraine.
At the same time, there were palpable reminders that the conflict was continuing. While he was talking, explosions — possibly Ukrainian forces deactivating mines — echoed in the distance. And Russian forces remained nearby, across the Dnipro River, within striking distance, another reminder of the immediate threat to the civilian population.
Mr. Zelensky was surrounded by dozens of soldiers and police officers carrying rifles, underscoring the daring nature of the visit.
The crowd of several hundred people cheered and shouted “glory to Ukraine.”
The Ukrainian president wore a hooded parka and cargo pants and looked a bit bleary-eyed but defiant. He spoke in front of the Kherson regional administration building, where only a few days ago the tricolors of the Russian flag flew above its imposing facade, and vowed to restore all of the land occupied by Russia to Ukraine.
Andriy Yermak, the head of Mr. Zelensky’s office, posted a video on Twitter of the Ukrainian flag being raised above the city.
Russia captured the Kherson region early in the conflict in March. Last week, the Kremlin ordered the withdrawal of its forces as Ukraine’s military bore down on the city, and later took control. Ukrainian troops arrived in triumph, receiving a hero’s welcome from a population that had lived through months of Russian occupation.
Since September, Ukraine has recaptured territory in the northeast of the country, as well as in the south.
Mr. Zelensky stayed for only about 10 minutes. After he left, the crowd remained.
A satellite dish had been set up in the square, and scores of people continued to try to reach loved ones.
Alina Samofalova, 26, who works at a human resources agency in Kherson and was wearing a yellow and blue flag over her shoulders, came to the main square Monday morning unaware that Mr. Zelensky was on his way.
“I am so excited he came,” said Ms. Samofalova, whose nails were painted yellow. “When the orcs were here, it was a gray mood like a black-and-white movie,” she said, using a common insult to refer to Russian soldiers.
“Now, it is like the sun is shining over the city.”
There is no power, heat, running water or internet, and Ukrainian officials have asked people to leave the city while it is made safe and essential services are restored.
Ms. Samofalova said she came to the square because it had such good energy. The fact that Mr. Zelensky would risk his own safety, she said, sent an important message to the people.
“When the government and president come to hear our problems,” she said, “they seem close to the people.”

WASHINGTON — The Pentagon has awarded more than $520 million in contracts to replace thousands of guided artillery rockets it has sent to Ukraine since June 1, according to a statement emailed to reporters on Monday morning.
The contracts, awarded to the defense contractor Lockheed Martin from Oct. 21 to Nov. 2, are for the purchase of Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System munitions — guided artillery rockets fired by mobile launchers called HIMARS — that have been credited with destroying scores of Russia’s command centers as well as its ammunition and supply depots in Ukraine. The munitions are usually called Gimmlers, after the abbreviation GMLRS.
“These awards demonstrate the significant impact GMLRS are having on the battlefield as a vital combat capability,” William A. LaPlante, the Pentagon’s top acquisitions official, said in the statement.
The number of rockets that will be purchased is unclear. A spokeswoman for Lockheed Martin did not immediately respond to a request for comment, and a spokesman for the U.S. Army’s Program Executive Office for Missiles and Space, which led the contracting process, was not immediately able to provide an answer.
According to government budget documents, the average purchase price of a single GMLRS rocket has varied between roughly $100,000 and $130,000 each since 2012. Using that figure, the contracts would account for approximately 4,000 replacement rockets.
The GMLRS rockets carry warheads with 200 pounds of explosives, using satellite guidance to strike in a range of about 52 miles — the longest reach of any weapon the United States has sent Ukraine to date. The Defense Department has said it has provided 16 HIMARS launchers to Ukraine thus far and has also given Kyiv the funds to purchase 18 more, though those will take years to be manufactured and delivered.
In June, a spokeswoman for the company told The New York Times that Lockheed had made more than 60,000 GMLRS rockets since the program began more than 20 years ago, and that it has sold them to a number of countries, including Bahrain, Britain, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Jordan, Poland, Romania, Singapore and the United Arab Emirates.

Ms. Griner has been detained in Russia since February after she flew into an airport near Moscow with a small amount of hashish oil in her luggage. She was sentenced in August to nine years in prison. Mr. Whelan was sentenced to a 16-year prison term on espionage charges by a Moscow court in 2020.
In August, American and Russian officials said they would use a special channel set up by Mr. Biden and Mr. Putin at their meeting in Geneva last year to negotiate over Ms. Griner and Mr. Whelan. U.S. officials have declined to divulge details of that channel. The Biden administration has offered to release Viktor Bout, a Russian arms dealer imprisoned in the United States, for the freedom of the two Americans.
Mr. Burns has previously been dispatched to interact with Russian officials over Ukraine. Before Mr. Putin ordered the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February, Mr. Burns flew to Moscow in November 2021 to tell Russian officials that the United States knew of the Russian plans and would forcefully respond to any invasion. Mr. Burns spoke by video to Mr. Putin, who was in Sochi at the time.

The U.S. imposes a new round of sanctions targeting Russia’s military supply chain and a wealthy gold magnate.
The U.S. State and Treasury Departments announced a fresh round of sanctions on Monday related to the war in Ukraine, taking aim at “Kremlin-linked elites” and Russia’s military supply chain.
The new measures — against 14 individuals and 28 entities — add to the sweeping economic penalties the United States and its allies have imposed in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. As of October, the U.S. government had issued about 1,500 new sanctions and amended 750 others since President Vladimir V. Putin ordered the invasion in February, according to the State Department.
“Today’s actions demonstrate Treasury’s steadfast commitment to targeting people around the world aiding Putin’s war effort and the crony elites who bankroll his regime,” the Treasury secretary, Janet L. Yellen, said in a statement.
So far, however, the sanctions have not been as devastating as Western officials hoped. Russia’s oil and gas exports have boomed this year, fueled by increased demand from China and India. And with oil prices high, Russia is on track to earn more this year than last from oil sales.
The targets of the sanctions announced on Monday include the Russian company Milandr, a microelectronics manufacturer involved with military research and development. Three companies tied to Milandr — based in Armenia, Taiwan and Switzerland — were also blacklisted, as were senior executives of the corporation. The foreign spinoffs have been used as front companies to “conduct Milandr’s business with foreign partners” and carry out financial transfers, the Treasury Department said in a statement.
“The United States will continue to disrupt Russia’s military supply chains and impose high costs on President Putin’s enablers, as well as all those who support Russia’s brutality against its neighbor,” Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said in a statement.
The sanctions also targeted Suleiman Kerimov, a Russian gold magnate and politician, along with his immediate family, associates and affiliated companies. Mr. Kerimov was sanctioned by the United States in 2018 and his $300 million mega yacht was seized in Fiji in May. Those targets include four French real estate companies belonging to one of his daughters
as well as Alexander-Walter Studhalter, a Swiss national who has
“allegedly laundered significant amounts of money on Kerimov’s behalf,” the Treasury Department said.
The Treasury Department also imposed sanctions on two Swiss companies holding assets benefiting Andrey Guryev, “a known close associate” of Mr. Putin, adding to sanctions the it levied against him in August. Mr. Guryev owns Witanhurst, a 25-bedroom mansion and grounds said to be the second-biggest residential property in London after Buckingham Palace.

Reports of atrocities in Kherson follow similar accusations in other reclaimed areas of Ukraine.

Finbarr O'Reilly for The New York Times
President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine said on Sunday that the authorities had discovered evidence of atrocities in Kherson similar to what has been found in other areas reclaimed from Russian forces.
In his nightly address, Mr. Zelensky said that Ukrainian investigators had already documented more than 400 potential Russian war crimes in parts of the Kherson region that Ukrainian forces have retaken.
“The bodies of both civilians and military personnel are being found,” Mr. Zelensky said. “In the Kherson region, the Russian army left behind the same atrocities as in other regions of our country.” He did not elaborate or provide further details.
Yevhen Yenin, a deputy minister in Ukraine’s Internal Affairs Ministry, said torture chambers were discovered “in the premises of police departments” in Kherson, the Ukrainian news outlet Ukrainska Pravda reported. Mr. Yenin said that these were “customary” to find in areas that had been occupied by Russian forces.
Russia captured Kherson, a symbolic and strategic prize for President Vladimir V. Putin, at the start of the war, and immediately moved to cut the city off from the world. Ukrainian officials and allies had feared that once the city was recaptured, they would discover the same signs of destruction that Russia left behind in other towns and cities.
Since Russian forces withdrew from the city days ago, a bitter blow to Mr. Putin, Ukrainian soldiers have been working to secure it and assess the damage.
Even though basic services were disrupted in Kherson, the city was spared the destruction that cities such as Mariupol had suffered. But in other parts of the region, whole villages were razed in months of brutal combat.
About 40 miles north of Kherson, in the city of Snihurivka, the authorities are investigating multiple reports of people being detained, tortured and forcibly deported, according to a local official, Ivan Kukhta. The Russians operated a torture chamber in the district police station, he added, and another in the basement of a local restaurant.
“People called us and said that the screams of people being tortured were very loud,” he said. “People who lived there in high-rise buildings had to move in with relatives on other streets, so as not to hear the screams.”
The accusations cast a renewed spotlight on Russian humanitarian violations and potential war crimes.
A United Nations-appointed panel of independent legal experts issued a report in September that concluded that war crimes had been committed in the conflict. The report added more chilling accusations to the list of crimes widely reported by Ukrainian and international investigators investigating the executions of civilians in Bucha, a suburb of Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv, and a mass burial site found near the town of Izium.

Citing neutrality, the Swiss refuse to allow ammunition exports to Ukraine.

BRUSSELS — Switzerland, citing its history of neutrality, has again refused to allow the export of ammunition to Ukraine for a German-made antiaircraft gun that is proving successful at taking down the cruise missiles and cheap Iranian-made drones used there by Russian forces.
Germany has provided Ukraine with 30 of the armored guns, known as Gepards, which are mobile and run on tank treads. Germany no longer uses Gepards, and the 35-millimeter ammunition they require is scarce. But Switzerland made ammunition for the Gepard, and Berlin and Kyiv have asked Switzerland to allow Germany to send the 12,400 rounds it possesses of that ammunition to Ukraine. Switzerland has refused to grant permission.
In a response this month to another request made by the German defense minister, Christine Lambrecht, the Swiss government said: “Under the principle of equal treatment in neutrality law, Switzerland cannot agree to a request for the transfer of war matériel of Swiss origin to Ukraine as long as the latter is involved in an international armed conflict.”
The response repeated a Swiss position taken in June, but the appearance on the battlefield since then of cheap Iranian-made self-destructing drones used by Russia to attack Ukraine’s electricity and heating infrastructure as winter sets in has made the situation more urgent.
The head of the Swiss department of Economic Affairs, Education and Research, Guy Parmelin, said in the response that “Switzerland is resolutely committed to peace and security, but always in strict compliance with the law of neutrality and in keeping with its humanitarian tradition.” To that end, he said this month, Switzerland “adopted a Winter Aid Action Plan to support the people of Ukraine” of some $106 million, “in addition to its existing humanitarian efforts in Ukraine and the region.”
Since Russia invaded Ukraine in late February, Switzerland has parted with past practice and adopted European Union sanctions intended to punish Russia. But Switzerland requires countries that buy Swiss arms to seek permission to re-export them. According to Swiss law, exports of war material must be refused if the country of destination is involved in an international armed conflict.
This year, the Swiss also rejected a Danish request to authorize the re-export of armored personnel carriers to Ukraine.
Last week, in an opinion piece in the newspaper Neue Zürcher Zeitung, Pavlo Klimkin, a former Ukrainian foreign minister, and Boris Ruge, the vice chairman of the Munich Security Conference, argued that providing the ammunition “would not determine the outcome of the war, but it would save lives, in Ukraine and beyond.”
If Germany could reconsider its own policies on arms supplies in light of Russia’s war, they argued, so could Switzerland.
“At the end of the day, this is about making a choice between traditional neutrality and solidarity with Ukraine,” they wrote. “Switzerland should decide in line with its values and long-term interests.”

Kherson residents say the Russification attempts ‘just didn’t work.’

KHERSON, Ukraine — Iryna Dyagileva’s daughter attended a school where the curriculum included memorizing the Russian national anthem.
But teachers ignored it, instead quietly greeting students in the morning with a salute: “Glory to Ukraine!”
The occupation authorities asked Olha Malyarchuk, a clerk at a taxi company, to settle bills in rubles. But she kept paying in the Ukrainian currency, hryvnia.
“It just didn’t work,” she said of Russian propaganda, beamed into homes through televisions and plastered on billboards for the nine months of Russia’s occupation of Kherson. On Sunday, she was walking in a park, waving a small Ukrainian flag.
One roadside billboard proclaimed in bold text, “We are together with Russia!” But a teenager who offered only his first name, Oleksandr, had shimmied up the supporting pole on Sunday and was tearing the sign to pieces. Asked how he felt, he said, “free.”
The Ukrainian army has reclaimed hundreds of villages in towns in three major counteroffensives, north of Kyiv, in the northeastern Kharkiv region and now in the southern Kherson region.
But the city of Kherson stands out: it was the focus of a major Russian campaign to assimilate the citizenry and stamp out of the Ukrainian identity. Judging by his assertions that Ukrainians and Russians are one nation, it was a goal President Vladimir V. Putin had harbored for all of Ukraine, had his military been more successful.
After Russian forces captured Kherson in the early days of the war, Ukrainian national songs were banned in the city. Speaking Ukrainian could lead to arrest. Schools adopted a Russian curriculum, and young students were to be told that they were Russians, not Ukrainians.
In the first hours and days after the city’s recapture by the Ukrainian army, signs have emerged suggesting that the Russian attempt was a largely futile effort, at least among those who remained in the city.
Many pro-Russian residents had evacuated as Ukraine’s army advance on the city, and the Kremlin-installed authorities had encouraged residents to leave. Many local government officials had collaborated with the Russians.
Serhiy Bloshko, a construction worker, had lived at the homes of friends through the nine-month occupation, fearful he’d be arrested for joining anti-occupation protests in March that broke out soon after the Russian army arrived. Soldiers indeed went to his home, he said. Not finding him, they made off with his television and refrigerator, he said.
“They repressed the pro-Ukrainian population,” he said while waiting in a line for water on Sunday afternoon. Friends had been detained and vanished, he said. Of the cultural assimilation effort, he said, “what happened here was ethnic cleansing.”
The entry into his city of the two armies, one in February and the other last week, was telling, he said.
“When our soldiers drove in, their machine guns were pointed up, into the air,” Mr. Bloshko said. “When the Russians drove in, their guns were pointed at the people. That explains everything. And they said they were our liberators.”

Russia’s Foreign Ministry denies a report that Lavrov was hospitalized in Bali.

Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei V. Lavrov, on Monday denied that he had been hospitalized following reports that he had experienced a health problem ahead of the high-profile Group of 20 summit of global leaders in Indonesia.
The Associated Press, citing multiple Indonesian government and medical officials, had reported that Mr. Lavrov “had been taken to the hospital after suffering a health problem following his arrival” on the island. Bali’s governor, I Wayan Koster, said that Mr. Lavrov had visited a hospital only for a “check” and that he was “healthy.”
A spokeswoman for the Russian Foreign Ministry, Maria Zakharova, said on the Telegram messaging app that the reports by news outlets of any health problem were “fake.” She did not specify whether Mr. Lavrov had seen a doctor in the hospital in Indonesia.
Ms. Zakharova also posted a video statement showing Mr. Lavrov sitting at a table, flipping though papers. The New York Times could not immediately verify when and where the video was recorded.
The Russian state news agency Tass reported that Mr. Lavrov told its reporter that he was preparing for the G20 summit.
“I’m at the hotel. I’m reading materials for tomorrow’s summit,” Mr. Lavrov said, according to Tass.
Mr. Lavrov is representing Russia at the G20 meeting in place of President Vladimir V. Putin, who decided not to attend. Europe and the United States are considering imposing more sanctions and further isolating Russia because of its invasion of Ukraine.

Criticism of Russia’s military from the country’s war hawks hits a new high.

Criticism by Russia’s pro-war faction of the country’s military’s performance in Ukraine has reached its most strident level yet in the aftermath of the withdrawal from the southern city of Kherson. By Sunday, the drumbeat of denunciations broke the taboo against singling out President Vladimir V. Putin himself and Russia’s very system of government.
Aleksandr Dugin, the right-wing ideologue whose concept of the Kremlin exerting control over a mythical “Russian World” helped to inspire the war in the first place, wrote an online post stressing that the main job of an autocratic ruler is to protect the people and the lands under his control. “The authorities in Russia cannot surrender anything else,” Mr. Dugin wrote. “The limit has been reached.”
Other social media posts questioned the authenticity of a September referendum in Kherson when the population allegedly voted overwhelmingly to become part of Russia — in sharp contrast to the jubilant crowds that have greeted Ukrainian soldiers since they started entering the city on Friday.
Some analysts suggested that the flow of criticism indicated Mr. Putin had failed to distance himself from the repeated setbacks in the war, but that the volume had yet to constitute a real liability.
“Matters are definitely getting worse for Putin, but it is hard to know the extent because he has crossed so many lines and has still been able to keep control of his inner circle and those who matter,” said Maxim Trudolyubov, a political analyst and former newspaper editor now living in exile. “So far they have been successful in doing damage control.”

Residents of Kherson were cut off from the wider world under Russian occupation, and retreating Russian soldiers severed communication lines, emptied grocery stores and closed pharmacies.
On Sunday, Ukrainians in the city were relieved to be free from Russian control — and to have the opportunity to contact their loved ones on the outside.
Lubov Peshkova, 49, right, cried as she looked at her grandchildren while speaking with her daughter by video call. Ms. Peshkova’s daughter, Danya, lives in Denmark.
“Don’t cry, my sweetheart,” Ms. Peshkova said through tears. “Everything is OK.”
A large group of residents gathered nearby, a common occurrence wherever there is a Starlink satellite signal and internet connection. The Starlink internet service, which works with satellites orbiting in space to provide online access, has become a digital lifeline for both Ukrainian soldiers and civilians.
Ukrainian officials have said they are working to restore the damaged infrastructure.
“We are restoring communication, internet, television,” President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine said in his nightly address on Sunday. “We are doing everything to restore normal technical capabilities for electricity and water supply as soon as possible.”

Winter will be a major factor in the war in Ukraine, officials say.

Finbarr O'Reilly for The New York Times
WASHINGTON — Senior Biden administration officials say Russia’s military operations in Ukraine will remain stalled well into next year, as recent Ukrainian advances upset Moscow’s hopes to seize more territory in areas that President Vladimir V. Putin has tried to portray as historically part of Russia.
While the officials say that Moscow is likely to continue to attack Ukrainian troops, bases, infrastructure and the electrical grid, the coming winter is expected to bring a slowdown in military advances on both sides.
A winter pause could last as long as six months. Rain and soft ground in late November will slow the movements of both militaries. Then, as temperatures fall and the ground freezes, it will be easier for tanks and trucks to move. But the possibility of heavy snows and even colder weather could make it difficult for the poorly equipped Russian army to mount any new offensive.
“You’re already seeing the sloppy weather in Ukraine slow things down a little bit,” Colin H. Kahl, the under secretary of defense for policy, told reporters this past week. “It’s getting really muddy, which makes it hard to do large-scale offensives.”
With a weather-enforced pause in major military movements, the war will enter a new phase.

Trump Wanted I.R.S. Investigations of Foes, Top Aide Says

Get it in your inbox.
While in office, President Donald J. Trump repeatedly told John F. Kelly, his second White House chief of staff, that he wanted a number of his perceived political enemies to be investigated by the Internal Revenue Service, Mr. Kelly said.
Mr. Kelly, who was chief of staff from July 2017 through the end of 2018, said in response to questions from The New York Times that Mr. Trump’s demands were part of a broader pattern of him trying to use the Justice Department and his authority as president against people who had been critical of him, including seeking to revoke the security clearances of former top intelligence officials.
Mr. Kelly said that among those Mr. Trump said “we ought to investigate” and “get the I.R.S. on” were the former F.B.I. director James B. Comey and his deputy, Andrew G. McCabe. His account of Mr. Trump’s desires to use the I.R.S. against his foes comes after the revelation by The Times this summer that Mr. Comey and Mr. McCabe had both been selected for a rare and highly intrusive audit by the tax agency in the years after Mr. Kelly left the White House.
Mr. Trump has said he knows nothing about the audits. The I.R.S. has asked its inspector general to investigate, and officials have insisted the two men were selected randomly for the audits.
Mr. Kelly said he made clear to Mr. Trump that there were serious legal and ethical issues with what he wanted. He said that despite the president’s expressed desires to have Mr. Comey and Mr. McCabe investigated by the I.R.S., he believes that he led Mr. Trump during his tenure as chief of staff to forgo trying to have such investigations conducted.
After Mr. Kelly left the administration, Mr. Comey was informed in 2019 that his 2017 returns were being audited, and Mr. McCabe learned in 2021 that his 2019 returns were being audited. At the time both audits occurred, the I.R.S. was led by a Trump political appointee.
Mr. Trump regularly made his demands in response to news reports in which he thought his perceived enemies made him look bad. The president would carry on about having them investigated to the point that Mr. Kelly thought he needed to tell the president that what he wanted was highly problematic, explaining, in sometimes heated conversations, that what Mr. Trump wanted was not just potentially illegal and immoral but also could blow back on him.
Mr. Trump would eventually let the idea go, Mr. Kelly said, but during subsequent outbursts about his enemies he would again bring up his desires to have them investigated.
Throughout Mr. Trump’s presidency he regularly, in both public and private, ranted about Mr. Comey, whom Mr. Trump had fired in May 2017, and Mr. McCabe, who played a leading role in the investigation into the Trump campaign’s ties to Russia.
Mr. Kelly said that along with Mr. Comey and Mr. McCabe, Mr. Trump discussed using the I.R.S. and the Justice Department to investigate the former C.I.A. director John O. Brennan; Hillary Clinton; Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon and the owner of The Washington Post, whose coverage often angered Mr. Trump; Peter Strzok, the lead F.B.I. agent on the Russia investigation; and Lisa Page, an F.B.I. official who exchanged text messages with Mr. Strzok that were critical of Mr. Trump.
What to Know About the Trump Investigations
Card 1 of 6
Numerous inquiries. Since leaving office, former President Donald J. Trump has been facing several investigations into his business dealings and political activities. Here is a look at some notable cases:
Classified documents inquiry. The F.B.I. searched Mr. Trump’s Florida home as part of the Justice Department’s investigation into his handling of classified materials. The inquiry is focused on documents that Mr. Trump had brought with him to Mar-a-Lago, his private club and residence, when he left the White House.
Jan. 6 investigations. In a series of public hearings, the House committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack laid out a comprehensive narrative of Mr. Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election. This evidence could allow federal prosecutors, who are conducting a parallel criminal investigation, to indict Mr. Trump.
Georgia election interference case. Fani T. Willis, the Atlanta-area district attorney, has been leading a wide-ranging criminal investigation into the efforts of Mr. Trump and his allies to overturn his 2020 election loss in Georgia. This case could pose the most immediate legal peril for the former president and his associates.
New York State’s civil case. Letitia James, the New York attorney general, has accused Mr. Trump, his family business and his three adult children of lying to lenders and insurers, fraudulently inflating the value of his assets. The allegations, included in a sweeping lawsuit, are the culmination of a yearslong civil investigation.
Manhattan criminal case. Alvin L. Bragg, the Manhattan district attorney, has been investigating whether Mr. Trump or his family business intentionally submitted false property values to potential lenders. The inquiry has yielded criminal charges against the Trump Organization and a plea deal with its chief financial officer, Allen H. Weisselberg.
“The U.S. government, whether it’s the I.R.S. or the Justice Department, should never be weaponized or used to retaliate, and certainly not because someone criticizes you in the press or is your political opponent,” Mr. Kelly said in response to questions. “The average federal employee or F.B.I. agent or I.R.S. agent goes to work and executes the laws and regulations and shouldn’t be put in this position.”
A spokeswoman for Mr. Trump denied that the former president had ever discussed using the I.R.S.
“It’s total fiction created by a psycho, John Kelly, who never said this before, and made it up just because he’s become so irrelevant,” said the spokeswoman, Liz Harrington.
Mr. Kelly, who also served as Mr. Trump’s first homeland security secretary, was Mr. Trump’s longest-serving White House chief of staff, a role in which he brought a semblance of order to an often chaotic West Wing. Unlike many former top Trump administration officials, Mr. Kelly has said little publicly since Mr. Trump left office and not written a book.
But in response to repeated questions over months, Mr. Kelly said he chose to respond now because Mr. Trump had publicly claimed last week that he had used the Justice Department and the F.B.I. to help Gov. Ron DeSantis win election in Florida in 2018. Mr. Kelly, who was Mr. Trump’s chief of staff at the time, said Mr. Trump never made such a request. If he had, Mr. Kelly said, it would have been an improper use of the Justice Department and the F.B.I.
Mr. Kelly’s statements are among the most damning from a former high-ranking official about Mr. Trump’s efforts to use federal power to his own ends, and come just days before Mr. Trump is scheduled to announce another presidential campaign.
His account of some of Mr. Trump’s requests, including his effort to use the Justice Department against his enemies and to remove security clearances for former officials, has been corroborated by other public disclosures and former Trump aides.
Mr. Kelly said that after he initially started working for Mr. Trump as his chief of staff in July 2017, he was surprised that Mr. Trump actually thought he would follow through on what the president wanted.
“He initially thought I would do it,” Mr. Kelly said. “He thought I would be loyal and obedient to him. I told him we were loyal to our oath to the Constitution.”
Mr. Kelly said Mr. Trump had no appreciation for that concept and continued to push him and others to do what he wanted.
“If he told you to slit someone’s throat, he thought you would go out and do it,” Mr. Kelly said.
Mr. Kelly said he would tell Mr. Trump why using the powers of the federal government for his political ends was morally and legally problematic.
“I would say, ‘It’s inappropriate, it’s illegal, it’s against their integrity and the I.R.S. knows what it’s doing and it’s not a good idea,’” Mr. Kelly said he told Mr. Trump.
“Yeah, but they’re writing bad things about me,” Mr. Kelly said Mr. Trump told him.
Among other steps sought by Mr. Trump, Mr. Kelly said, was the revocation of security clearances for officials from the George W. Bush and Obama administrations who had gone on to be critical of Mr. Trump on television. Among them were Mr. Brennan; James R. Clapper Jr., the former director of national intelligence; Michael Hayden, the former director of the C.I.A. and the National Security Agency; and the retired Adm. William H. McRaven, the former head of the Special Operations Command.
“I don’t want them making money,” Mr. Kelly said Mr. Trump told him.
Mr. Kelly said that during his tenure, the officials’ security clearances remained intact.
In refuting the claim by Mr. Trump that he had used the Justice Department and the F.B.I. to help Mr. DeSantis when he faced a potential recount in 2018, Mr. Kelly said no such request had been made to the Justice Department or the F.B.I. In fact, Mr. Kelly said, Mr. Trump was growing increasingly disillusioned with Mr. DeSantis at the time. That fall, Mr. DeSantis had distanced himself from Mr. Trump’s public claim that Democrats inflated the death toll in Puerto Rico from Hurricane Maria.
“He was insufficiently impressed with DeSantis’s loyalty to him,” Mr. Kelly said.
Mr. Trump never made any secret of his belief that he could use his government powers to his political ends, frequently saying in public that the Justice Department should investigate his enemies and that the former intelligence officials should not have clearances. Congressional and Justice Department investigations, news media accounts and books about the Trump presidency have also shown that Mr. Trump tried behind closed doors to use the powers of the Justice Department against his enemies.
But far less is known about how he tried to weaponize the I.R.S.
Mr. Trump was familiar with how I.R.S. audits functioned. In the closing year of his presidency, he remained engaged in a decade-long audit battle with the agency over the legitimacy of a $72.9 million tax refund that he claimed, and received, after declaring huge losses. (The current status of the audit is not publicly known.)
It is against federal law for executive branch employees — including the president, the vice president or any other White House official — “to request, directly or indirectly” that anyone at the Internal Revenue Service conduct an investigation or audit of any taxpayer.
The Times reported in July that between 2019 and 2021, when the I.R.S. was being led by Mr. Trump’s appointee, Mr. Comey and Mr. McCabe were subjected to the same type of rare audit that is so invasive it is known among tax lawyers as “an autopsy without the benefit of death.”
I.R.S. officials have insisted that the men were randomly picked for the audit and that there were no political motivations behind how they were chosen. Out of the 153 million returns filed for the year Mr. Comey was audited, only 5,000 tax returns were targeted for the audit. For the year Mr. McCabe was audited, 154 million people filed returns and 8,000 were selected for the audit.
Mr. Kelly said that Mr. Trump was particularly “obsessed” with Mr. McCabe’s wife, Jill, who had run for Virginia’s state assembly around the time the F.B.I. was investigating Mrs. Clinton’s use of a personal email account. Mr. Trump has repeatedly made the false claim that Ms. McCabe, a Democrat, received money for her campaign directly from the Clintons.
“That was proof McCabe hated him,” Mr. Kelly said.
Mr. Trump regularly attacked Mr. Comey and Mr. McCabe in public when he was president. He called Mr. Comey a “dirty cop” who “should be tried for treason” and “should be arrested on the spot!” He also accused Mr. McCabe of treason.
By the end of the Trump administration, the Justice Department and its inspector general had investigated the conduct of Mr. Comey, Mr. McCabe, Mr. Strzok and Ms. Page in a range of matters, but they were never charged with any crimes.
A year before Mr. McCabe’s audit began, Mr. Trump raised public doubts about Mr. McCabe’s finances.
“Was Andy McCabe ever forced to pay back the $700,000 illegally given to him and his wife, for his wife’s political campaign, by Crooked Hillary Clinton while Hillary was under FBI investigation, and McCabe was the head of the FBI??? Just askin’?” Mr. Trump tweeted in September 2020.

New York City, Once a Minimum Wage Leader, Now Lags Behind
As inflation has surged, other cities have vaulted past New York’s $15 minimum wage, considered a trailblazer only a few years ago.

For New York City workers like Alexchayanne Diaz-Larui, an employee at a Midtown Chipotle, mandatory minimum wage increases are a distant memory.

Nov. 14, 2022
When New York City’s minimum wage first reached $15 nearly four years ago, New York was at the forefront of the movement to raise living standards for workers in the fast-food industry and other low-paying sectors. But in recent months, as the costs of rent, groceries and utilities have surged, the minimum wage in a growing list of cities, including Washington, Los Angeles and Denver, has vaulted past.
New York, unlike those cities, did not link its minimum wage to the rate of inflation. As the cost of living rises across the country, workers earning the lowest wages in the nation’s biggest city are seeing their incomes steadily reduced in real terms.
Since New York raised its minimum wage to $15 an hour for most workers at the end of 2018, the buying power of that wage has fallen by about 15 percent, according to James A. Parrott, director for economic and fiscal policy at the Center for New York City Affairs at the New School. Those workers have effectively been set back four years to the days when their minimum wage was $13 an hour, he said.
The power to set a minimum wage for all workers in New York City lies with the State Legislature. Attempts by Democrats in Albany to change state law to start adjusting the city’s minimum wage for inflation have so far failed to overcome opposition from business groups that object to the additional mandates.
Mr. Parrott said that if New York State does not act soon to raise the city’s minimum wage, it is likely to fall further behind other cities as the cost of living continues to rise. “The fact that rents have gone up so much faster than incomes everywhere is going to add to pressure for places that haven’t adopted a higher minimum wage to do that,” he said.
The trend of rising minimum wages is largely confined to states and cities where Democrats hold sway. But on Tuesday, voters in Nebraska approved a measure to gradually raise their state’s minimum wage from $9 to $15 by 2026. There are 20 states — including Pennsylvania, Georgia and Texas — that have not set a low wage higher than the federal minimum, which has been $7.25 an hour since 2009.

In cities that adjust for inflation, the minimum wages are rising fast. In July, Washington’s rose by 90 cents to $16.10 an hour. In January, Seattle and Denver are scheduled to increase theirs by $1.42, based on local inflation rates. Those raises will lift Seattle’s minimum wage to $18.69 an hour and Denver’s to $17.29. In Los Angeles, inflation added more than $1 to the local minimum wage in July, boosting it to $16.04 an hour.
Gabriela Garcia, a housekeeper who shares a room in Brooklyn with her two children, said her hourly wage of $15 no longer allowed her to buy the chicken breasts and cookies her young son craved. Ms. Garcia, 47, said a friend in Seattle earns $25 an hour for similar work and had advised her to move across the country for better pay.
“Housekeeping in general is not an easy job,” she said in Spanish, through an interpreter. “It’s a job that will leave you very exhausted.”
Ms. Garcia said she hoped that New York would raise its minimum wage to at least $20 an hour soon, so she no longer had to ask herself, “Do I put food on the table or do I pay my rent?”
A decade ago, New York was on the front lines of a brewing movement to improve the circumstances of low-wage workers. The campaign, known as the “Fight for 15,” began in 2012 when workers walked out of dozens of food-service businesses in the city, demanding to be paid $15 an hour and be allowed to form a union.
Those demands sounded fanciful at first, but with the backing of powerful labor unions like the New York Hotel and Gaming Trades Council and the Service Employees International Union, they spurred a proposal to raise the minimum hourly wage for most workers in the city from $9 to $15 in just three years.
“The $15 minimum wage was a bold, significant step in getting closer to a living wage,” said Paul K. Sonn, state policy program director at the National Employment Law Project, which supports low-wage workers. But now, he added, “the highest inflation in 40 years is causing New York’s minimum wage to fall far, far behind.”

Consumer prices have risen this year at a painful pace that many Americans have never experienced. The official national rate of inflation for the 12 months through September was 8.2 percent. For the New York metropolitan area, it was lower — 6.2 percent — largely because the high cost of gasoline has less impact on city dwellers.
Employers’ costs are rising, and they generally would object to any mandatory wage increases for that reason, said Ken Pokalsky, vice president of the Business Council of New York State. Mr. Pokalsky said an increase would be counterproductive because “it hits most directly in sectors like hospitality that are still facing challenges in recovering” from the effects of the pandemic.
He added that many low-wage jobs had already been replaced by machines and further hikes would spur more automation. “Something’s got to give,” he said.
In New York City, the minimum wage for most workers has not changed since Dec. 31, 2018, when it reached $15 after three annual increases of $2 each.

For workers like Alexchayanne Diaz-Larui, who labors over the grill at a Chipotle restaurant in Midtown Manhattan, those mandatory annual raises of $2 an hour are a distant memory. Now, he said, his best hope is an increase of 25 cents an hour every six months from Chipotle.
“We all know that the cost of living, food, everything is going up faster than what we can get raise-wise,” Mr. Diaz-Larui said.
He puts in three six-hour shifts a week at Chipotle and earns $18.10 an hour, after a small raise last spring, he said. “You do the math. That’s not a livable wage.”
Mr. Diaz-Larui, 44, said the minimum wage in New York should be raised to at least $20 an hour and indexed to inflation. He noted that the child-support payments he makes to the mother of his two teenage children are subject to cost-of-living adjustments.
New York policymakers were not averse to factoring inflation into the minimum wage when they passed the law mandating the increase to $15 in 2016 — but only for upstate areas, where the minimum wage was scheduled to rise more gradually because the cost of living was lower.
Three suburban counties — Nassau, Suffolk and Westchester — arrived at a $15 minimum wage at the end of 2021 with no further increases scheduled. But the rest of the state is still on a path to $15 that is set by factoring in inflation and gains in worker productivity.
In early October, the state’s Department of Labor announced that the minimum wage upstate would rise by $1 on Dec. 31 to $14.20 an hour.
New York City has set wages for specific types of work, as the Taxi and Limousine Commission did when it required the biggest ride-hailing apps, including Uber and Lyft, to pay drivers a minimum amount for each trip, which is pegged to inflation.
In February, Mayor Eric Adams announced that those rates would rise by 5.3 percent. “This is about respect and paying each one of these individuals a fair and decent wage,” he said then.
Asked for Mr. Adams’s position on the citywide minimum wage, Charles Lutvak, a spokesman for the mayor said, “We look forward to working with our colleagues in Albany this legislative session to seriously consider raising the minimum wage while also recognizing that still-struggling small businesses may need financial help if they’ll be asked to pay workers more.”
Some Democratic state lawmakers have proposed raising the minimum wage significantly in New York City and the rest of the state. Jessica Ramos, a state senator from Queens, plans to reintroduce a bill that she sponsored in the last legislative session that would raise the minimum wage in the city and surrounding suburbs to $21.25 an hour by 2026 and the wage for the rest of the state to $20. From there, each minimum wage would adjust annually to account for inflation.
“Our minimum wage has fallen out of phase with the cost of living,” Ms. Ramos said. “It’s not fair to leave New Yorkers behind.”
Ms. Ramos said she did not yet know if the measure would receive support from Gov. Kathy Hochul, who was recently elected to her first full term in office. A spokeswoman for the governor pointed out that the state had announced the impending increase in the upstate minimum wage but declined to comment on the effort to raise the city’s minimum wage.

On the first nationwide test of American students since the pandemic, scores plummeted to levels not seen in 20 years. The results show how challenging it was to keep students on track during the pandemic.
What do the scores tell us about remote learning, who lost the most ground academically, and what can schools do to help students recover?

Here’s what to know about the shooting in Charlottesville.
A University of Virginia student has been arrested and charged in the shooting deaths of three members of the school’s football team and the wounding of two other people Sunday night, university officials said Monday.
The suspect is being charged with three counts of second-degree murder and three counts of using a handgun in the commission of a felony, the authorities said.
The university campus was locked down under a shelter-in-place order for nearly 12 hours while the authorities searched for the suspect, whom they identified as Christopher Darnell Jones Jr. The university canceled classes on Monday, and public schools in the surrounding county were closed.

American colleges and universities have been no stranger to gun violence this year. The shooting in Charlottesville, Va., Sunday night was at least the fifth since February on or near campuses in Virginia alone.
Campus-related shootings around the country have caused numerous injuries and deaths, and subjected students and staff to countless hours of lockdowns as the police sought suspects or tried to establish whether there was a continuing threat.
Here is a partial list of reported shooting incidents connected with college campuses in 2022:

The suspect and at least three of the victims in the shooting at the University of Virginia on Sunday night had links to the university’s football team.
The three students who were killed — Devin Chandler, Lavel Davis Jr. and D’Sean Perry — were current players on the team. The suspect, Christopher Jones Jr., was a running back on the 2018 team, but he did not appear in any games, and was not on the roster in subsequent seasons.
Davis Jr., a junior from South Carolina, was a starting wide receiver and the third-leading pass receiver on the team this season; he caught two touchdowns. Perry was a junior reserve linebacker from Florida who appeared in six of the team’s 10 games. Chandler was a junior wide receiver who transferred to Virginia from the University of Wisconsin, and had yet to appear in a game for the ’Hoos, as the university’s sports teams are known informally.

Edu Bayer for The New York Times
The shooting at the University of Virginia on Sunday, in which three people were killed, stirred memories of other violent episodes at the school and in the city of Charlottesville, Va., in recent years.
Charlottesville was the site of the “Unite the Right” rally of white nationalists in the summer of 2017, which began as a demonstration over the removal of a Confederate statue and then turned violent. A man drove his car into a crowd of counterprotesters, killing Heather Heyer, 32, and injuring at least 19 others.

‘People are stuck in the libraries’: Students describe a campus that is sheltering in place.
Eva Surovell, a senior and the editor in chief of The Cavalier Daily, the University of Virginia’s student newspaper, said by phone early Monday that students were sheltering in place across the campus: “People are stuck in the libraries, they’re stuck in academic buildings, they’re stuck in you name it,” she said.
Ms. Surovell, 21, said that when she learned of the shooting, she ran to the scene and later returned to her room at the center of campus. “I’ve been in my room since probably about 3 a.m. and you can hear cop cars, like cop sirens, every 15 or 20 minutes or so,” she said.
She said the shooting occurred at the start of what was already expected to be a stressful week for students, coming the week before Thanksgiving break.

At about 10:30 p.m., on Sunday, the police received reports of shots fired on campus at a garage on Culbreth Road.
At least three people were killed and two others injured. It was not immediately clear if the victims were students.
The University of Virginia Police Department identified the gunman as Christopher Darnell Jones Jr., who the university president said in an email to the campus was a student at the school. He remains at large as of Monday morning, and the police described him as “armed and dangerous.”

Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei V. Lavrov, on Monday denied that he had been hospitalized following reports that he had experienced a health problem ahead of the high-profile Group of 20 summit of global leaders in Indonesia.
The Associated Press, citing multiple Indonesian government and medical officials, had reported that Mr. Lavrov “had been taken to the hospital after suffering a health problem following his arrival” on the island. Bali’s governor, I Wayan Koster, said that Mr. Lavrov had visited a hospital only for a “check” and that he was “healthy.”
A spokeswoman for the Russian Foreign Ministry, Maria Zakharova, said on the Telegram messaging app that the reports by news outlets of any health problem were “fake.” She did not specify whether Mr. Lavrov had seen a doctor in the hospital in Indonesia.
Ms. Zakharova also posted a video statement showing Mr. Lavrov sitting at a table, flipping though papers. The New York Times could not immediately verify when and where the video was recorded.
The Russian state news agency Tass reported that Mr. Lavrov told its reporter that he was preparing for the G20 summit.
“I’m at the hotel. I’m reading materials for tomorrow’s summit,” Mr. Lavrov said, according to Tass.
Mr. Lavrov is representing Russia at the G20 meeting in place of President Vladimir V. Putin, who decided not to attend. Europe and the United States are considering imposing more sanctions and further isolating Russia because of its invasion of Ukraine.

Yellen Encourages Vaccinations in China as Covid Restrictions Slow Growth
With China’s strict pandemic policies stalling the economy at home and globally, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said American mRNA vaccines are at the ready.

BALI, Indonesia — Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen said on Monday that she hopes China is able to roll out a more effective vaccination campaign to combat the coronavirus. Thus far, Beijing has largely contained its spread with strict lockdowns and travel restrictions that have slowed its economy and weighed on global economic growth.
Speaking on the sidelines of the Group of 20 gathering, ahead of a meeting between President Biden and China’s top leader, Xi Jinping, Ms. Yellen said the United States was prepared to help China in its efforts to stop the spread of the virus.
“I believe that we have offered China American mRNA vaccines, and I believe that they have not been interested in taking us up on that,” Ms. Yellen told reporters, referring to the vaccine technology that was first developed in the West and has been adopted in many countries.
Ms. Yellen added: “To the extent that it might be helpful to them, certainly we want to see them be able to deal effectively with the pandemic, both for their own sake and the sake of the entire world. So we certainly stand ready to be of assistance.”
A Treasury official said that Ms. Yellen was not suggesting that the United States would donate vaccines to China, but rather was noting Beijing’s refusal to import vaccines produced by U.S. drug companies.
China has focused on developing homegrown vaccines but has yet to roll out one with the mRNA technology used in the inoculations that have proved most effective. An mRNA vaccine that China developed was approved for use in Indonesia in September.
Chancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany said in Beijing this month that he had been assured that China would accelerate the approval process for Covid-19 vaccines made by the German company BioNTech and that, in turn, he would push for Chinese vaccines to be granted regulatory approval by the European Union.
China has maintained a zero-tolerance approach to Covid, and Ms. Yellen said that Beijing’s pandemic policies were among the reasons that the Chinese economy is slowing. Last week, China softened some of its Covid restrictions, which pleased investors, but a rise in infections has raised questions about whether measures will be tightened again.
The Treasury secretary will be participating in Mr. Biden’s meeting with Mr. Xi later on Monday, and she is expected to meet with Yi Gang, the governor of the People’s Bank of China, later this week. She told The New York Times on Saturday that she hopes the meetings will help “stabilize” the relationship between the United States and China and improve communication between the world’s two largest economies.
“We’ve been very clear that we have national security concerns and would like to address those,” Ms. Yellen said on Monday. Those concerns, she said, include the dependence of American supply chains on China for minerals that are used in batteries and solar panels.

Here is what to know about Monday’s summit.
BALI, Indonesia — President Biden and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, met for nearly three hours to hash out some of the thorniest issues in their relationship, including tensions over Taiwan, the economy and a return to climate negotiations.
Mr. Biden and Mr. Xi made a cautious promise to try to improve a relationship that is at its most rancorous point in decades, and he pledged to send his top envoy to China soon.
Mr. Biden warned Mr. Xi that China’s aggressive stance toward Taiwan threatened stability in the region and could ultimately jeopardize the global economy. Mr. Xi replied that Taiwan’s independence was as incompatible to peace and stability as “fire and water.”

WASHINGTON — Antony J. Blinken, the U.S. secretary of state, plans to visit China early next year to follow up on the meeting between President Biden and China’s leader, Xi Jinping, in Bali, Indonesia, a State Department official in Washington said on Monday.
The trip to China by Mr. Blinken, his first as secretary of state, would have the same broad aims as the meeting in Bali: to keep the lines of communication open and to have frank exchanges about important issues at senior levels in order to avoid conflict. American and Chinese officials plan to work out details of the trip over the coming weeks.
Mr. Biden said at his news conference in Bali on Monday night that Mr. Blinken would make a trip sometime soon. Mr. Blinken sat to Mr. Biden’s right as the American delegation met in a hotel with Mr. Xi and Chinese officials. The U.S. ambassador to China, R. Nicholas Burns, was also on the American side of the table.

The statements that the United States and China put out after the meeting on Monday between President Biden and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, had some similarities: Both described the talks as candid and agreed that the countries must work together on global issues like climate change, food security and economic stability.
But on other issues, the summaries of the meeting presented by the countries differed. Most strikingly, they appeared to reflect fundamentally different views on the relations between the two countries and where they are headed. Mr. Biden appeared determined to stay on the current course, saying that the United States would “continue to compete vigorously” with China but that this “competition should not veer into conflict,” according to the U.S. account of the meeting.
In a summary of the meeting published by Chinese state media, Mr. Xi appeared to express more dissatisfaction with the direction of relations. He said the relationship between the United States and China did not conform to the fundamental interests of the countries or their people, or meet the expectations of the international community. He argued that the leaders should return relations to the track of “healthy and stable development.” But he did not clarify what point in history he was referring to, given relations with China have been strained for years.

The Chinese government has responded angrily to those restrictions and nodded at them in its readout from the meetings, saying that fighting trade wars and technology wars and pushing for decoupling violates market economy principles undermine the rules of international trade. China opposes the “politicization and weaponization” of economic, trade, scientific and technology exchanges, it added.

One point of friction hanging over the meeting was the sweeping restrictions the United States issued last month on China’s access to semiconductor technology.

President Xi Jinping of China followed his usual practice in Bali, Indonesia, on Monday of not taking questions from foreign correspondents.
That was not always the case with Chinese leaders.
Jiang Zemin, China’s top leader from 1989 to 2002 as general secretary of the country’s Communist Party, used to take questions after meetings with American presidents, but the practice began to fade under his successor, .

Lam Yik Fei for The New York Times
While President Biden sought to lower the temperature on Taiwan in his summit with China’s leader, Xi Jinping, their talks were also a sharp reminder that the future of the island remains the issue most likely to plunge U.S.-China relations into crisis, even war.
The status of Taiwan has been a contentious point between Beijing and Washington ever since President Richard M. Nixon made his groundbreaking trip to Beijing half a century ago. Chinese Communist Party leaders and many Chinese people adamantly believe that Taiwan is Chinese territory, snatched from Beijing’s hands when defeated Nationalist forces fled to the island after their defeat in China’s civil war.
But nowadays most people in Taiwan see their country as a distinctive and proudly democratic society that could never survive under Chinese sovereignty. Under the so-called “one China” policy, successive American presidents have said they “acknowledged” Beijing’s claim to Taiwan, but did not go as far as endorsing or accepting that claim, and opposed any unilateral moves by either side to change the status quo.

At any bilateral summit, attention is focused on the two leaders facing off across the negotiating table. But the advisers sitting next to President Biden as he met with Xi Jinping, the Chinese leader, on Monday sent a clear signal about who he listens to.
On the U.S. side, two cabinet members were there: Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken, and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. So too was Jake Sullivan, the national security adviser, who was the chief architect of the strategy published recently that declared China was the only nation with the intent, the capability and the technology to challenge the United States over the long term — and thus the No. 1 national security concern.
But the other American attendees were of note. , the American ambassador to China and one of the United States’ most experienced diplomats, has seen little of the most senior Chinese leadership since he arrived in the country, partly because of Covid restrictions and partly because Beijing believes its ambassador to Washington has been kept at arm’s length.

In conversations with American executives this spring, top officials in the Biden administration revealed an aggressive plan to counter the Chinese military’s rapid technological advances.
China was using supercomputing and artificial intelligence to develop stealth and hypersonic weapons systems, and to try to crack the U.S. government’s most encrypted messaging, according to intelligence reports. For months, administration officials debated what they could do to hobble the country’s progress.
They saw a path: The Biden administration would use U.S. influence over global technology and supply chains to try to choke off China’s access to advanced chips and chip production tools needed to power those abilities. The goal was to keep Chinese entities that contributed to potential threats far behind their competitors in the United States and in allied nations.

China’s “no-limits” friendship with Russia, which has not wavered since President Vladimir V. Putin invaded Ukraine, has been denounced by the Biden administration. But the relationship is so opaque that U.S. officials disagree on its true nature.
Whether it’s a partnership of convenience or a robust alliance, Beijing and Moscow share a growing interest in frustrating the American agenda, many in Washington believe. In turn, many in China see the combination of new U.S. export controls and NATO support for Ukraine as foreshadowing how Washington could try to contain China, and stymie its claims to Taiwan, a self-ruled island.
This month, Xi Jinping told the visiting German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, “the threat or use of nuclear weapons,” an oblique but unusually public reproach to Mr. Putin’s saber rattling with tactical nuclear weapons.

Before President Biden traveled to Indonesia, he attended a meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations in Cambodia, betting that an in-person appearance would help reinforce his administration’s broad efforts to counter China’s rise, even as ASEAN countries embrace economic ties with Beijing.
“We will build a better future we all say we want to see,” Mr. Biden said at his third ASEAN summit as president, “for all one billion people in our countries.”
The president announced a series of new initiatives between the United States and the ASEAN countries: Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. The initiatives include efforts to promote electric vehicle use in the region, to improve clean-water access and to offer loans to support female entrepreneurs.

President Biden and Xi Jinping have a history — they first met as vice presidents — but Monday’s summit will mark the first time they will sit in the same room together since each became top leader.
They have talked by phone or video call five times in the past 18 months, during which U.S.-China tensions have increased and Mr. Xi has repeatedly warned Mr. Biden against what he sees as meddling in affairs related to Taiwan, the self-governing island that China claims as its own. Here’s a look back at each of those conversations, according to official accounts by both governments:

The meeting will give American officials their first chance at understanding how Mr. Xi plans to deputize people around him to keep lines of communication with the U.S. open. Mr. Xi used a Communist Party congress last month to tighten his grip on domestic power, and a White House official said that they would be looking for “new faces” in attendance at the meeting.

Xi, more powerful than ever, sees an increasingly perilous world.

Last month, Xi Jinping laid out his priorities for a breakthrough third term in power in a key report to a Communist Party congress. The omission of two phrases exposed his anxieties about an increasingly volatile world where Washington is contesting China’s ascent as an authoritarian superpower.
For two decades, successive Chinese leaders have declared at the congress that the country was in a “period of important strategic opportunity,” implying that China faced no imminent risk of major conflict and could focus more on economic growth. For even longer, leaders have said that “peace and development remain the themes of the era,” suggesting that whatever may be going wrong in the world, the grand trends were on China’s side.
But the two slogans, so unvarying that they rarely drew attention, were not in Mr. Xi’s report to the weeklong congress. Not in his 104-minute speech summarizing the report. Nor in the 72-page Chinese full version given to officials and journalists.

Biden was joined in the meeting by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Jake Sullivan, the national security adviser. All the U.S. and Chinese officials were wearing masks, except for the two leaders. “I believe there is little substitute for face-to-face communication.” Biden said, adding that he hoped the two leaders could find “ways to work together on urgent global issues that require our mutual cooperation.”

Last month, President Biden released his 48-page national security strategy, which focused relentlessly on China even as Russia wages war in Ukraine. In the document, which every new administration is required to issue, Mr. Biden made clear that over the long term he was more worried about China’s moves to “layer authoritarian governance with a revisionist foreign policy” than he was about a declining, battered Russia.
“Russia and the P.R.C. pose different challenges,” Mr. Biden wrote, using the abbreviation for the People’s Republic of China. “Russia poses an immediate threat to the free and open international system, recklessly flouting the basic laws of the international order today, as its brutal war of aggression against Ukraine has shown.”
But more than eight months after the invasion of Ukraine, the Russian military appears less fearsome than it did when the first drafts of the document circulated in the White House in December.

The meeting between President Biden and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, on neutral ground in Bali, has a Cold War feel: more about managing potential conflict than finding common ground. The rancor between the United States and China on a range of issues means that even short-term stabilization and cooperation on shared challenges — climate change, containing North Korea’s nuclear program or stopping pandemics — could be fragile.
“This is in a sense the first superpower summit of the Cold War Version 2.0,” said Evan S. Medeiros, a Georgetown University professor who was President Barack Obama’s top adviser on Asia-Pacific affairs. “Will both leaders discuss, even implicitly, the terms of coexistence amid competition? Or, by default, will they let loose the dogs of unconstrained rivalry?”
Neither side calls it a Cold War, a term evoking a world divided between Western and Soviet camps bristling with nuclear arsenals. And the differences are real between that era and this one, with its vast trade flows and technological commerce between China and Western powers.

BALI, Indonesia — Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen said on Monday that she hopes China is able to roll out a more effective vaccination campaign to combat the coronavirus. Thus far, Beijing has largely contained its spread with strict lockdowns and travel restrictions that have slowed its economy and weighed on global economic growth.
Speaking on the sidelines of the Group of 20 gathering, ahead of a meeting between President Biden and China’s top leader, Xi Jinping, Ms. Yellen said the United States was prepared to help China in its efforts to stop the spread of the virus.
“I believe that we have offered China American mRNA vaccines, and I believe that they have not been interested in taking us up on that,” Ms. Yellen told reporters, referring to the vaccine technology that was first developed in the West and has been adopted in many countries.

Here’s a Look at the Midterm Races That Remain Undetermined
Democrats sealed control of the Senate, but the House is still up for grabs.

While control of the Senate has been settled, the House is still up for grabs.
As of Monday morning, there were 19 uncalled races, many of them in western states where Democrats are hoping to flip Republican-held seats. Not all of these races are squeakers, though; some of them clearly favor one party but haven’t been called yet simply because not enough votes have been counted.
Here’s a closer look at some of the most competitive districts — the ones that are likeliest to decide control of the House.
House
Arizona: The races in Arizona’s First District (where Democrats are hoping to unseat Representative David Schweikert) and Sixth District (an open seat featuring Juan Ciscomani, a Republican, and Kirsten Engel, a Democrat) are both within a single percentage point.
California: Democrats have a chance of defeating Republican incumbents in a handful of California seats, including Representative David Valadao in the 22nd District and Ken Calvert in the 41st District. There is also a very close race for an open seat in the 13th District.
Colorado: Democrats have a small chance to flip a seat in the Third District, where their candidate, Adam Frisch, trails Representative Lauren Boebert by a little over 1,000 votes but could potentially come out ahead if he does well in ballots from military members, American citizens overseas and voters who “cure” rejected ballots.
Oregon: One close race remains in the Sixth District, between Andrea Salinas, a Democrat, and Mike Erickson, a Republican.

Governors
The big uncalled governor’s race is in Arizona, where Secretary of State Katie Hobbs, a Democrat, has a narrow lead over Kari Lake, a Trump-aligned former TV news anchor, with thousands of votes still to be counted. Those ballots will also determine who wins the state’s uncalled race for attorney general.
Senate
The race between Senator Raphael Warnock, a Democrat, and Herschel Walker, a Republican and former football star, is heading to a Dec. 6 runoff after neither candidate cleared the 50 percent threshold to win outright. Democratic wins in Arizona and Nevada mean that control of the Senate no longer hinges on Georgia, but the difference between 50 seats and 51 could be highly significant when it comes to legislating.

KYIV, Ukraine — Ukrainian and Russian forces traded fire on Monday from across the broad expanse of the Dnipro River that now divides them after Russia’s retreat from the southern city of Kherson, reshaping the battlefield with a victory that Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, declared marked “the beginning of the end of the war.”
The Dnipro has become the new front line in southern Ukraine, and officials there warned of continued danger from fighting in regions that have already endured months of Russian occupation.
Through the afternoon, artillery fire picked up in a southern district of the city near the destroyed Antonivsky Bridge over the Dnipro, stoking fears that the Russian Army would retaliate for the loss of the city with a bombardment from its new positions on the eastern bank.
Mortar shells struck near the bridge, sending up puffs of smoke. Near the riverfront, incoming rounds rang out with thunderous, metallic booms. It was not immediately possible to assess what had been hit.
The head of the Kherson regional military administration, Yaroslav Yanushevich, urged the tens of thousands of remaining residents in the city to evacuate while Ukrainian forces worked to clear land mines, hunt down Russian soldiers left behind and restore essential services.
The mines are a significant danger. Four people, including an 11-year-old, were killed when a family driving in the village of Novoraysk, outside the city, ran over a mine, Mr. Yanushevich said. Another mine injured six railway workers who were trying to restore service after lines were damaged. And there were at least four more children reportedly injured by mines across the region, Ukrainian officials said in statements.
The deaths underscored the threats still remaining on the ground, even as Mr. Zelensky made a surprise visit to Kherson, a tangible sign of Ukraine’s soaring morale.
“We are, step by step, coming to all of our country,” Mr. Zelensky said in a short appearance in the city’s main square on Monday, as hundreds of jubilant residents celebrated.
Russian forces continued to fire from across the river on towns and villages newly recaptured by Ukrainian forces, according to the Ukrainian military’s southern command. Two Russian missiles struck the town of Beryslav, which is just north of a critical dam, the military said. It was not immediately known if there were any casualties.
The Ukrainian government is setting up evacuation routes to the cities of Mykolaiv and Kryvyi Rih, said Iryna Vereshchuk, a Ukrainian deputy prime minister. “We will not have time to restore power supplies enough to heat homes where children, the sick and people with reduced mobility live,” she said. “It will not be a mass evacuation. It will cover those who are sick, the elderly and those left without care of their relatives.”
A senior U.S. military official said on Monday that Russian forces continued to target civilian infrastructure, although the pace of missile and drone strikes appeared to have slowed down some since the end of October.
On the Dnipro’s eastern bank, residents described an increasingly repressive environment as Russian soldiers poured into the area.
“Occupants rob local people and exchange stuff for samogon,” or homemade vodka, said one resident, Tatiana, who communicated via a secure messaging app from Oleshky, a town across the river from Kherson City. “Then they get drunk and even more aggressive. We are so scared here.” She asked that her surname be withheld for security.
Other residents on the eastern bank offered similar accounts of disorder and chaos.
“Russians roam around, identify the empty houses and settle there,” Ivan, 45, wrote in a text message. He lives in Skadovsk, which is south of Kherson city, and asked that his surname not be used out of concern for his safety. “We try to connect with the owners and to arrange for someone local to stay in their place. So that it is not abandoned and Russians don’t take it.”
Throughout the weekend, the Ukrainian military sought to target Russian forces as they tried to regroup after their retreat from Kherson. The Ukrainian air force launched strikes on the east side of the river, with the Ukrainian military saying it had fired on 33 Russian positions.
Andrew E. Kramer and Anna Lukinova contributed reporting.

Residents of the newly reclaimed city of Kherson on Monday described months of brutality and mistreatment by Russian forces, including the theft of vehicles, beatings and detention for anyone suspected of opposing the nearly nine-month occupation.
In interviews, they described how the Russians rounded up residents, whether for their political views or because they were suspected of belonging to a partisan underground group.
At an open-air street market selling essentials like painkillers and toilet paper that were missing from shops, many residents offered stories of acquaintances detained, with some saying they’d heard of torture.
Vyacheslav Lukashuk, 27, a lanky handyman, said he had wound up face down on the floor of his living room after about a dozen soldiers burst into his home and beat him. They ended up holding him for seven days.
“All I did was write, ‘Glory to Ukraine’ in spray paint on a bus stop,” he said.
The worst abuse occurred in the first minutes, he said. A soldier slipped a plastic bag over his head and clasped it around his neck to suffocate him, and other soldiers kicked him and beat him with rifle butts, he said.
“They just flew in and started beating me,” Mr. Lukashuk said. “I said goodbye to my life at that moment.”

After he was taken to a jail, Mr. Lukashuk said, other detainees told him they were tortured with electrical shocks, and he could hear screams in the evenings. Mr. Lukashuk said that he was not tortured during his detainment, but that he did confess and apologize for the pro-Ukrainian graffiti — a confession that was posted online along with those of other residents who admitted to pro-Ukrainian activities or views, in an apparent effort to shame or humiliate them.
Mykhail Tkachov, a dealer at a lot that sold new cars and traded used vehicles, said Russian forces had claimed to be there for the residents’ protection but frequently stole from them, particularly targeting vehicles.
Mr. Tkachov said he and his colleagues had scattered an inventory of almost 200 cars across courtyards and street parking places around the city in the first days after the Russian Army arrived. But the Russians detained one of the dealers, and he revealed the locations and handed over the keys.
“People lived like shadows,” afraid to make their presence known, Mr. Tkachov said, while the Russian soldiers made themselves at home.
“I saw eight of them sitting in a cafe right on this street,” he said. “They drove up in civilian cars without license plates, obviously stolen from somebody.”
Serhiy Karasenko, selling home-pickled cauliflower, cabbage and tomatoes at a market stall, said Russian soldiers made off with his car last week, just before fleeing the city. He now carries his wares to the market by taxi. His car, he said, is “gone. I won’t see it again.”
Mr. Tkachov said some people’s cars were stolen at Russian checkpoints. Soldiers took them, ostensibly after finding problems with the Ukrainian registration documents, like a car not registered to the driver. The company-owned car of a friend, he said, was confiscated.
“It’s a business car,” Mr. Tkachov said the man told the soldiers. But he said the soldiers responded, “It’s our business now,” and took the car.

The State of the War
Retaking Kherson: On Nov. 11, Ukrainian soldiers swept into the southern city of Kherson, which Russian forces had occupied for more than eight months, seizing a major symbolic and strategic prize and dealing a bitter blow to Russia’s president, Vladimir V. Putin.
What’s Next?: Cheering crowds greeted Ukrainian forces as they entered Kherson, but analysts agree that the war is far from over. Here’s a look at what might lie ahead.
Winter Looms: Many analysts and diplomats have suggested there could be a pause in major combat over the winter. But after pushing the Russians out of Kherson, Ukraine has no desire to stop.
Peace Talks: While Gen. Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has made the case that the Ukrainians should try to cement their gains at the bargaining table, some U.S. officials say that peace talks remain a distant prospect.

Zelensky Visits Newly Freed Kherson
“This war took the best heroes of our country,” President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine said during an unannounced visit to the newly recaptured city of Kherson.

KHERSON, Ukraine — President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine made an unannounced visit to the newly freed city of Kherson on Monday, reveling in perhaps the most significant success by his country’s forces since Russia’s full-scale invasion began in February.
“This is the beginning of the end of the war,” he said to a crowd of hundreds of people, some wrapped in Ukrainian flags.
The president’s visit to Kherson just days after it was retaken was a tangible sign of Ukraine’s soaring morale and its growing boldness in the nearly nine-month war. Kherson, a vital Black Sea port and a gateway to Crimea, was the first major city to fall to Russian forces after the start of the invasion on Feb. 24. Russia’s decision to withdraw was a major blow to the Kremlin and its ambition to conquer all of southern Ukraine.
At the same time, there were palpable reminders that the conflict was continuing. While he was talking, explosions — possibly Ukrainian forces deactivating mines — echoed in the distance. And Russian forces remained nearby, across the Dnipro River, within striking distance, another reminder of the immediate threat to the civilian population.
Mr. Zelensky was surrounded by dozens of soldiers and police officers carrying rifles, underscoring the daring nature of the visit.
The crowd of several hundred people cheered and shouted “glory to Ukraine.”
The Ukrainian president wore a hooded parka and cargo pants and looked a bit bleary-eyed but defiant. He spoke in front of the Kherson regional administration building, where only a few days ago the tricolors of the Russian flag flew above its imposing facade, and vowed to restore all of the land occupied by Russia to Ukraine.
Andriy Yermak, the head of Mr. Zelensky’s office, posted a video on Twitter of the Ukrainian flag being raised above the city.
Russia captured the Kherson region early in the conflict in March. Last week, the Kremlin ordered the withdrawal of its forces as Ukraine’s military bore down on the city, and later took control. Ukrainian troops arrived in triumph, receiving a hero’s welcome from a population that had lived through months of Russian occupation.
Since September, Ukraine has recaptured territory in the northeast of the country, as well as in the south.
Mr. Zelensky stayed for only about 10 minutes. After he left, the crowd remained.
A satellite dish had been set up in the square, and scores of people continued to try to reach loved ones.
Alina Samofalova, 26, who works at a human resources agency in Kherson and was wearing a yellow and blue flag over her shoulders, came to the main square Monday morning unaware that Mr. Zelensky was on his way.
“I am so excited he came,” said Ms. Samofalova, whose nails were painted yellow. “When the orcs were here, it was a gray mood like a black-and-white movie,” she said, using a common insult to refer to Russian soldiers.
“Now, it is like the sun is shining over the city.”
There is no power, heat, running water or internet, and Ukrainian officials have asked people to leave the city while it is made safe and essential services are restored.
Ms. Samofalova said she came to the square because it had such good energy. The fact that Mr. Zelensky would risk his own safety, she said, sent an important message to the people.
“When the government and president come to hear our problems,” she said, “they seem close to the people.”

The Pentagon will pay Lockheed Martin more than $520 million to replace guided rockets sent to Ukraine.

WASHINGTON — The Pentagon has awarded more than $520 million in contracts to replace thousands of guided artillery rockets it has sent to Ukraine since June 1, according to a statement emailed to reporters on Monday morning.
The contracts, awarded to the defense contractor Lockheed Martin from Oct. 21 to Nov. 2, are for the purchase of Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System munitions — guided artillery rockets fired by mobile launchers called HIMARS — that have been credited with destroying scores of Russia’s command centers as well as its ammunition and supply depots in Ukraine. The munitions are usually called Gimmlers, after the abbreviation GMLRS.
“These awards demonstrate the significant impact GMLRS are having on the battlefield as a vital combat capability,” William A. LaPlante, the Pentagon’s top acquisitions official, said in the statement.
The number of rockets that will be purchased is unclear. A spokeswoman for Lockheed Martin did not immediately respond to a request for comment, and a spokesman for the U.S. Army’s Program Executive Office for Missiles and Space, which led the contracting process, was not immediately able to provide an answer.
According to government budget documents, the average purchase price of a single GMLRS rocket has varied between roughly $100,000 and $130,000 each since 2012. Using that figure, the contracts would account for approximately 4,000 replacement rockets.
The GMLRS rockets carry warheads with 200 pounds of explosives, using satellite guidance to strike in a range of about 52 miles — the longest reach of any weapon the United States has sent Ukraine to date. The Defense Department has said it has provided 16 HIMARS launchers to Ukraine thus far and has also given Kyiv the funds to purchase 18 more, though those will take years to be manufactured and delivered.
In June, a spokeswoman for the company told The New York Times that Lockheed had made more than 60,000 GMLRS rockets since the program began more than 20 years ago, and that it has sold them to a number of countries, including Bahrain, Britain, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Jordan, Poland, Romania, Singapore and the United Arab Emirates.

The C.I.A. director meets with his Russian counterpart to warn against the use of nuclear weapons in Ukraine.

William J. Burns, the director of the Central Intelligence Agency, met with his Russian counterpart in Turkey on Monday to warn Russia against the use of nuclear weapons in Ukraine, a White House spokesman said.
The talks in Ankara — the highest level face-to-face meetings between senior Russian and American officials since Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine in February — were seen as part of the administration’s efforts to step up its communications with senior officials in Russia, which has made numerous veiled threats about using a nuclear weapon in Ukraine.
The National Security Council said the meeting was not in any way to negotiate or to discuss any settlement of the war in Ukraine. Ukraine was briefed in advance on the trip, the spokesman said.
President Biden has insisted that Ukraine, and not the United States, will dictate if and when negotiations commence to end the war. But a disagreement has emerged at the highest levels of the U.S. government over whether to press Ukraine to seek a diplomatic end to the war with Russia, with America’s top general, Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, urging in closed-door meetings that Ukraine should negotiate to cement its recent gains.
In a post on the messaging app Telegram on Monday, Gen. Valeriy Zaluzhny, the commander of the Ukrainian military, said he had spoken to General Milley and reiterated the country’s position on possible negotiations: Russia must withdraw before any talks are possible.
“The Ukrainian military will not accept any negotiations, agreements or compromise decisions,” he wrote.
U.S. and European leaders see their goal for now as keeping the war contained to Ukraine and deterring President Vladimir V. Putin from using a tactical nuclear weapon or another weapon of mass destruction in the conflict. Mr. Putin has denied that Moscow is preparing to use a nuclear weapon in Ukraine, but senior American officials say that senior Russian military leaders have recently discussed the possibility of using a tactical nuclear weapon in the country.
Kommersant, a Russian business daily newspaper, reported on Monday that the Russian delegation in Ankara was headed by Sergei Naryshkin, the head of the country’s foreign intelligence service.
The Kremlin’s spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, confirmed to Tass, a Russian state news service, that a meeting had taken place. The meeting had been initiated by the United States, he said, but he would not disclose the topics discussed. A C.I.A. spokeswoman declined to comment; the agency never comments on the director’s travel.
Russian and Ukrainian officials have made separate public comments in recent weeks about potential peace negotiations, more than six months after their last known direct talks fell apart. But U.S. officials have said that they do not believe talks will begin soon and that both sides, for now, think that continued fighting will strengthen their eventual negotiating positions.
The National Security Council said that Mr. Burns had planned in the meeting raise the matter of Americans detained in Russia. The Biden administration has been trying to negotiate a prisoner swap with Russia to bring home the W.N.B.A. star Brittney Griner and Paul Whelan.
Ms. Griner has been detained in Russia since February after she flew into an airport near Moscow with a small amount of hashish oil in her luggage. She was sentenced in August to nine years in prison. Mr. Whelan was sentenced to a 16-year prison term on espionage charges by a Moscow court in 2020.
In August, American and Russian officials said they would use a special channel set up by Mr. Biden and Mr. Putin at their meeting in Geneva last year to negotiate over Ms. Griner and Mr. Whelan. U.S. officials have declined to divulge details of that channel. The Biden administration has offered to release Viktor Bout, a Russian arms dealer imprisoned in the United States, for the freedom of the two Americans.
Mr. Burns has previously been dispatched to interact with Russian officials over Ukraine. Before Mr. Putin ordered the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February, Mr. Burns flew to Moscow in November 2021 to tell Russian officials that the United States knew of the Russian plans and would forcefully respond to any invasion. Mr. Burns spoke by video to Mr. Putin, who was in Sochi at the time.

The U.S. imposes a new round of sanctions targeting Russia’s military supply chain and a wealthy gold magnate.
The U.S. State and Treasury Departments announced a fresh round of sanctions on Monday related to the war in Ukraine, taking aim at “Kremlin-linked elites” and Russia’s military supply chain.
The new measures — against 14 individuals and 28 entities — add to the sweeping economic penalties the United States and its allies have imposed in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. As of October, the U.S. government had issued about 1,500 new sanctions and amended 750 others since President Vladimir V. Putin ordered the invasion in February, according to the State Department.
“Today’s actions demonstrate Treasury’s steadfast commitment to targeting people around the world aiding Putin’s war effort and the crony elites who bankroll his regime,” the Treasury secretary, Janet L. Yellen, said in a statement.
So far, however, the sanctions have not been as devastating as Western officials hoped. Russia’s oil and gas exports have boomed this year, fueled by increased demand from China and India. And with oil prices high, Russia is on track to earn more this year than last from oil sales.
The targets of the sanctions announced on Monday include the Russian company Milandr, a microelectronics manufacturer involved with military research and development. Three companies tied to Milandr — based in Armenia, Taiwan and Switzerland — were also blacklisted, as were senior executives of the corporation. The foreign spinoffs have been used as front companies to “conduct Milandr’s business with foreign partners” and carry out financial transfers, the Treasury Department said in a statement.
“The United States will continue to disrupt Russia’s military supply chains and impose high costs on President Putin’s enablers, as well as all those who support Russia’s brutality against its neighbor,” Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said in a statement.
The sanctions also targeted Suleiman Kerimov, a Russian gold magnate and politician, along with his immediate family, associates and affiliated companies. Mr. Kerimov was sanctioned by the United States in 2018 and his $300 million mega yacht was seized in Fiji in May. Those targets include four French real estate companies belonging to one of his daughters
as well as Alexander-Walter Studhalter, a Swiss national who has
“allegedly laundered significant amounts of money on Kerimov’s behalf,” the Treasury Department said.
The Treasury Department also imposed sanctions on two Swiss companies holding assets benefiting Andrey Guryev, “a known close associate” of Mr. Putin, adding to sanctions the it levied against him in August. Mr. Guryev owns Witanhurst, a 25-bedroom mansion and grounds said to be the second-biggest residential property in London after Buckingham Palace.

Reports of atrocities in Kherson follow similar accusations in other reclaimed areas of Ukraine.

Finbarr O'Reilly for The New York Times
President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine said on Sunday that the authorities had discovered evidence of atrocities in Kherson similar to what has been found in other areas reclaimed from Russian forces.
In his nightly address, Mr. Zelensky said that Ukrainian investigators had already documented more than 400 potential Russian war crimes in parts of the Kherson region that Ukrainian forces have retaken.
“The bodies of both civilians and military personnel are being found,” Mr. Zelensky said. “In the Kherson region, the Russian army left behind the same atrocities as in other regions of our country.” He did not elaborate or provide further details.
Yevhen Yenin, a deputy minister in Ukraine’s Internal Affairs Ministry, said torture chambers were discovered “in the premises of police departments” in Kherson, the Ukrainian news outlet Ukrainska Pravda reported. Mr. Yenin said that these were “customary” to find in areas that had been occupied by Russian forces.
Russia captured Kherson, a symbolic and strategic prize for President Vladimir V. Putin, at the start of the war, and immediately moved to cut the city off from the world. Ukrainian officials and allies had feared that once the city was recaptured, they would discover the same signs of destruction that Russia left behind in other towns and cities.
Since Russian forces withdrew from the city days ago, a bitter blow to Mr. Putin, Ukrainian soldiers have been working to secure it and assess the damage.
Even though basic services were disrupted in Kherson, the city was spared the destruction that cities such as Mariupol had suffered. But in other parts of the region, whole villages were razed in months of brutal combat.
About 40 miles north of Kherson, in the city of Snihurivka, the authorities are investigating multiple reports of people being detained, tortured and forcibly deported, according to a local official, Ivan Kukhta. The Russians operated a torture chamber in the district police station, he added, and another in the basement of a local restaurant.
“People called us and said that the screams of people being tortured were very loud,” he said. “People who lived there in high-rise buildings had to move in with relatives on other streets, so as not to hear the screams.”
The accusations cast a renewed spotlight on Russian humanitarian violations and potential war crimes.
A United Nations-appointed panel of independent legal experts issued a report in September that concluded that war crimes had been committed in the conflict. The report added more chilling accusations to the list of crimes widely reported by Ukrainian and international investigators investigating the executions of civilians in Bucha, a suburb of Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv, and a mass burial site found near the town of Izium.

Citing neutrality, the Swiss refuse to allow ammunition exports to Ukraine.

BRUSSELS — Switzerland, citing its history of neutrality, has again refused to allow the export of ammunition to Ukraine for a German-made antiaircraft gun that is proving successful at taking down the cruise missiles and cheap Iranian-made drones used there by Russian forces.
Germany has provided Ukraine with 30 of the armored guns, known as Gepards, which are mobile and run on tank treads. Germany no longer uses Gepards, and the 35-millimeter ammunition they require is scarce. But Switzerland made ammunition for the Gepard, and Berlin and Kyiv have asked Switzerland to allow Germany to send the 12,400 rounds it possesses of that ammunition to Ukraine. Switzerland has refused to grant permission.
In a response this month to another request made by the German defense minister, Christine Lambrecht, the Swiss government said: “Under the principle of equal treatment in neutrality law, Switzerland cannot agree to a request for the transfer of war matériel of Swiss origin to Ukraine as long as the latter is involved in an international armed conflict.”
The response repeated a Swiss position taken in June, but the appearance on the battlefield since then of cheap Iranian-made self-destructing drones used by Russia to attack Ukraine’s electricity and heating infrastructure as winter sets in has made the situation more urgent.
The head of the Swiss department of Economic Affairs, Education and Research, Guy Parmelin, said in the response that “Switzerland is resolutely committed to peace and security, but always in strict compliance with the law of neutrality and in keeping with its humanitarian tradition.” To that end, he said this month, Switzerland “adopted a Winter Aid Action Plan to support the people of Ukraine” of some $106 million, “in addition to its existing humanitarian efforts in Ukraine and the region.”
Since Russia invaded Ukraine in late February, Switzerland has parted with past practice and adopted European Union sanctions intended to punish Russia. But Switzerland requires countries that buy Swiss arms to seek permission to re-export them. According to Swiss law, exports of war material must be refused if the country of destination is involved in an international armed conflict.
This year, the Swiss also rejected a Danish request to authorize the re-export of armored personnel carriers to Ukraine.
Last week, in an opinion piece in the newspaper Neue Zürcher Zeitung, Pavlo Klimkin, a former Ukrainian foreign minister, and Boris Ruge, the vice chairman of the Munich Security Conference, argued that providing the ammunition “would not determine the outcome of the war, but it would save lives, in Ukraine and beyond.”
If Germany could reconsider its own policies on arms supplies in light of Russia’s war, they argued, so could Switzerland.
“At the end of the day, this is about making a choice between traditional neutrality and solidarity with Ukraine,” they wrote. “Switzerland should decide in line with its values and long-term interests.”

Kherson residents say the Russification attempts ‘just didn’t work.’

KHERSON, Ukraine — Iryna Dyagileva’s daughter attended a school where the curriculum included memorizing the Russian national anthem.
But teachers ignored it, instead quietly greeting students in the morning with a salute: “Glory to Ukraine!”
The occupation authorities asked Olha Malyarchuk, a clerk at a taxi company, to settle bills in rubles. But she kept paying in the Ukrainian currency, hryvnia.
“It just didn’t work,” she said of Russian propaganda, beamed into homes through televisions and plastered on billboards for the nine months of Russia’s occupation of Kherson. On Sunday, she was walking in a park, waving a small Ukrainian flag.
One roadside billboard proclaimed in bold text, “We are together with Russia!” But a teenager who offered only his first name, Oleksandr, had shimmied up the supporting pole on Sunday and was tearing the sign to pieces. Asked how he felt, he said, “free.”
The Ukrainian army has reclaimed hundreds of villages in towns in three major counteroffensives, north of Kyiv, in the northeastern Kharkiv region and now in the southern Kherson region.
But the city of Kherson stands out: it was the focus of a major Russian campaign to assimilate the citizenry and stamp out of the Ukrainian identity. Judging by his assertions that Ukrainians and Russians are one nation, it was a goal President Vladimir V. Putin had harbored for all of Ukraine, had his military been more successful.
After Russian forces captured Kherson in the early days of the war, Ukrainian national songs were banned in the city. Speaking Ukrainian could lead to arrest. Schools adopted a Russian curriculum, and young students were to be told that they were Russians, not Ukrainians.
In the first hours and days after the city’s recapture by the Ukrainian army, signs have emerged suggesting that the Russian attempt was a largely futile effort, at least among those who remained in the city.
Many pro-Russian residents had evacuated as Ukraine’s army advance on the city, and the Kremlin-installed authorities had encouraged residents to leave. Many local government officials had collaborated with the Russians.
Serhiy Bloshko, a construction worker, had lived at the homes of friends through the nine-month occupation, fearful he’d be arrested for joining anti-occupation protests in March that broke out soon after the Russian army arrived. Soldiers indeed went to his home, he said. Not finding him, they made off with his television and refrigerator, he said.
“They repressed the pro-Ukrainian population,” he said while waiting in a line for water on Sunday afternoon. Friends had been detained and vanished, he said. Of the cultural assimilation effort, he said, “what happened here was ethnic cleansing.”
The entry into his city of the two armies, one in February and the other last week, was telling, he said.
“When our soldiers drove in, their machine guns were pointed up, into the air,” Mr. Bloshko said. “When the Russians drove in, their guns were pointed at the people. That explains everything. And they said they were our liberators.”

Russia’s Foreign Ministry denies a report that Lavrov was hospitalized in Bali.

Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei V. Lavrov, on Monday denied that he had been hospitalized following reports that he had experienced a health problem ahead of the high-profile Group of 20 summit of global leaders in Indonesia.
The Associated Press, citing multiple Indonesian government and medical officials, had reported that Mr. Lavrov “had been taken to the hospital after suffering a health problem following his arrival” on the island. Bali’s governor, I Wayan Koster, said that Mr. Lavrov had visited a hospital only for a “check” and that he was “healthy.”
A spokeswoman for the Russian Foreign Ministry, Maria Zakharova, said on the Telegram messaging app that the reports by news outlets of any health problem were “fake.” She did not specify whether Mr. Lavrov had seen a doctor in the hospital in Indonesia.
Ms. Zakharova also posted a video statement showing Mr. Lavrov sitting at a table, flipping though papers. The New York Times could not immediately verify when and where the video was recorded.
The Russian state news agency Tass reported that Mr. Lavrov told its reporter that he was preparing for the G20 summit.
“I’m at the hotel. I’m reading materials for tomorrow’s summit,” Mr. Lavrov said, according to Tass.
Mr. Lavrov is representing Russia at the G20 meeting in place of President Vladimir V. Putin, who decided not to attend. Europe and the United States are considering imposing more sanctions and further isolating Russia because of its invasion of Ukraine.

Criticism of Russia’s military from the country’s war hawks hits a new high.

Maxim Shemetov/Reuters
Criticism by Russia’s pro-war faction of the country’s military’s performance in Ukraine has reached its most strident level yet in the aftermath of the withdrawal from the southern city of Kherson. By Sunday, the drumbeat of denunciations broke the taboo against singling out President Vladimir V. Putin himself and Russia’s very system of government.
Aleksandr Dugin, the right-wing ideologue whose concept of the Kremlin exerting control over a mythical “Russian World” helped to inspire the war in the first place, wrote an online post stressing that the main job of an autocratic ruler is to protect the people and the lands under his control. “The authorities in Russia cannot surrender anything else,” Mr. Dugin wrote. “The limit has been reached.”
Other social media posts questioned the authenticity of a September referendum in Kherson when the population allegedly voted overwhelmingly to become part of Russia — in sharp contrast to the jubilant crowds that have greeted Ukrainian soldiers since they started entering the city on Friday.
Some analysts suggested that the flow of criticism indicated Mr. Putin had failed to distance himself from the repeated setbacks in the war, but that the volume had yet to constitute a real liability.
“Matters are definitely getting worse for Putin, but it is hard to know the extent because he has crossed so many lines and has still been able to keep control of his inner circle and those who matter,” said Maxim Trudolyubov, a political analyst and former newspaper editor now living in exile. “So far they have been successful in doing damage control.”

Residents of Kherson were cut off from the wider world under Russian occupation, and retreating Russian soldiers severed communication lines, emptied grocery stores and closed pharmacies.
On Sunday, Ukrainians in the city were relieved to be free from Russian control — and to have the opportunity to contact their loved ones on the outside.
Lubov Peshkova, 49, right, cried as she looked at her grandchildren while speaking with her daughter by video call. Ms. Peshkova’s daughter, Danya, lives in Denmark.
“Don’t cry, my sweetheart,” Ms. Peshkova said through tears. “Everything is OK.”
A large group of residents gathered nearby, a common occurrence wherever there is a Starlink satellite signal and internet connection. The Starlink internet service, which works with satellites orbiting in space to provide online access, has become a digital lifeline for both Ukrainian soldiers and civilians.
Ukrainian officials have said they are working to restore the damaged infrastructure.
“We are restoring communication, internet, television,” President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine said in his nightly address on Sunday. “We are doing everything to restore normal technical capabilities for electricity and water supply as soon as possible.”

Winter will be a major factor in the war in Ukraine, officials say.

Finbarr O'Reilly for The New York Times
WASHINGTON — Senior Biden administration officials say Russia’s military operations in Ukraine will remain stalled well into next year, as recent Ukrainian advances upset Moscow’s hopes to seize more territory in areas that President Vladimir V. Putin has tried to portray as historically part of Russia.
While the officials say that Moscow is likely to continue to attack Ukrainian troops, bases, infrastructure and the electrical grid, the coming winter is expected to bring a slowdown in military advances on both sides.
A winter pause could last as long as six months. Rain and soft ground in late November will slow the movements of both militaries. Then, as temperatures fall and the ground freezes, it will be easier for tanks and trucks to move. But the possibility of heavy snows and even colder weather could make it difficult for the poorly equipped Russian army to mount any new offensive.
“You’re already seeing the sloppy weather in Ukraine slow things down a little bit,” Colin H. Kahl, the under secretary of defense for policy, told reporters this past week. “It’s getting really muddy, which makes it hard to do large-scale offensives.”
With a weather-enforced pause in major military movements, the war will enter a new phase.

A historic visit as Kherson represents not just the biggest win of Ukr in the 9-month war given it's the 1st major urban center to be freed, but the biggest loss for Rus since its withdrawal from the outer parts of Kyiv. It certainly set the stage to liberate the other 3 oblasts.

Yellen Encourages Vaccinations in China as Covid Restrictions Slow Growth
With China’s strict pandemic policies stalling the economy at home and globally, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said American mRNA vaccines are at the ready.

BALI, Indonesia — Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen said on Monday that she hopes China is able to roll out a more effective vaccination campaign to combat the coronavirus. Thus far, Beijing has largely contained its spread with strict lockdowns and travel restrictions that have slowed its economy and weighed on global economic growth.
Speaking on the sidelines of the Group of 20 gathering, ahead of a meeting between President Biden and China’s top leader, Xi Jinping, Ms. Yellen said the United States was prepared to help China in its efforts to stop the spread of the virus.
“I believe that we have offered China American mRNA vaccines, and I believe that they have not been interested in taking us up on that,” Ms. Yellen told reporters, referring to the vaccine technology that was first developed in the West and has been adopted in many countries.
Ms. Yellen added: “To the extent that it might be helpful to them, certainly we want to see them be able to deal effectively with the pandemic, both for their own sake and the sake of the entire world. So we certainly stand ready to be of assistance.”
A Treasury official said that Ms. Yellen was not suggesting that the United States would donate vaccines to China, but rather was noting Beijing’s refusal to import vaccines produced by U.S. drug companies.
China has focused on developing homegrown vaccines but has yet to roll out one with the mRNA technology used in the inoculations that have proved most effective. An mRNA vaccine that China developed was approved for use in Indonesia in September.
Chancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany said in Beijing this month that he had been assured that China would accelerate the approval process for Covid-19 vaccines made by the German company BioNTech and that, in turn, he would push for Chinese vaccines to be granted regulatory approval by the European Union.
China has maintained a zero-tolerance approach to Covid, and Ms. Yellen said that Beijing’s pandemic policies were among the reasons that the Chinese economy is slowing. Last week, China softened some of its Covid restrictions, which pleased investors, but a rise in infections has raised questions about whether measures will be tightened again.
The Treasury secretary will be participating in Mr. Biden’s meeting with Mr. Xi later on Monday, and she is expected to meet with Yi Gang, the governor of the People’s Bank of China, later this week. She told The New York Times on Saturday that she hopes the meetings will help “stabilize” the relationship between the United States and China and improve communication between the world’s two largest economies.
“We’ve been very clear that we have national security concerns and would like to address those,” Ms. Yellen said on Monday. Those concerns, she said, include the dependence of American supply chains on China for minerals that are used in batteries and solar panels.

Here’s the latest in the race for the House and other contests.
Republicans are on the precipice of claiming control of the House of Representatives — one seat shy of the 218 seats needed to take power back from the Democrats.
The Associated Press called three races for Republicans late Monday, including the re-elections of Representative Michelle Steel and Representative Ken Calvert, both of California. In New York, Republicans also maintained control of the seat of the retiring Representative John Katko, a moderate who had held a Syracuse-based district that had voted for Democrats in the last two presidential elections. Brandon Williams, a Republican Navy veteran, defeated Francis Conole, the Democrat, in that contest.
The results left Republicans with 217 seats. Control of the House could be determined as early as Tuesday. of the Republican path needed to win.

Brandon Williams, a conservative Republican and an avid supporter of former President Donald J. Trump, has defended an open Republican seat, defeating a centrist Democrat, Francis Conole, according to The Associated Press.
Mr. Williams will replace Representative John Katko, a moderate Republican, in a contest that was considered one of Democrats’ best chances at an upset this cycle. The loss puts Republicans one step closer to control of the House.
In 2020, the Syracuse-based district went for Joseph R. Biden Jr. by nine percentage points; four years earlier, voters gave Hillary Clinton a decisive edge. But Mr. Williams overcame that, in part thanks to a well-funded and enthusiastic Republican campaign apparatus.

Representative Ken Calvert, a Republican, won an unexpectedly tough re-election race to keep his seat in the California desert, according to The Associated Press, holding off one of the toughest challenges of his 30 years in Congress.
Mr. Calvert, a conservative who rarely strays from the Republican Party line, faced stiffer competition than usual after newly drawn boundaries for the 41st Congressional District pushed him into an area that leaned more to the left, adding Palm Springs, where a large bloc of L.G.B.T.Q. voters who opposed Mr. Calvert gave Democrats hope of wresting his seat.
They criticized his voting record opposing L.G.B.T.Q. rights, which earned him a , as well as homophobic fliers he circulated two decades ago during a campaign against a gay Democratic opponent who had not come out yet.

Republicans have closed within striking distance of flipping the House after a night of strong returns in Arizona and California. They’re now just four seats from the 218 needed for a majority, and they have a lead of at least three points in four races that might put them over the top: The Third, 27th, 41st and 45 Districts in California.

Biggs is not expected to muster the support needed to beat Mr. McCarthy. But the move was a sign of deep discontent with McCarthy among the party’s right flank that could weaken his bid for the top leadership position. “We have a new paradigm here, and I think the country wants a different direction from the Houses.”

Lake claimed the ad was doing the opposite of its intended effect, lifting her campaign donations and website traffic. Tonight, just before The Associated Press called Lake’s defeat, Cheney responded: “You’re welcome, @KariLake.”

PHOENIX — Katie Hobbs, who as Arizona’s secretary of state stood up to efforts by allies of former President Donald J. Trump to overturn the 2020 election, has clinched a victory in the state’s race for governor, according to The Associated Press.
Ms. Hobbs, a Democrat, narrowly defeated Kari Lake, a right-wing former newscaster who was talked about as a future leader in a Trump-dominated Republican Party, in a bitter and closely watched race that became a final test of whether candidates molded in Mr. Trump’s image could win in battlegrounds. Ms. Lake, one of the most prominent purveyors of Mr. Trump’s lies about his 2020 election, followed several other election-denying candidates in defeat.
In a statement on her win, Ms. Hobbs reached out to voters who did not support her. “I will work just as hard for you — because even in this moment of division, I believe there is so much more that connects us.”

Control of the House of Representatives will be decided in the coming days or maybe weeks — sorry — by the outcomes of around 15 races. More than half of them are in California, and the rest are in a smattering of other states.
These contests have little in common, other than the fact that they are either very close or in districts that have been slow to count ballots. Some, like California’s 22nd Congressional District, were always expected to go down to the wire; in others, like Colorado’s Third District, a Republican incumbent who was widely believed to be safe has run into unexpectedly fierce competition. A few races might not even be that close, but there are too many uncounted ballots to know yet.
Based on what has been counted so far, where the remaining ballots come from and how they were cast — by mail or in person, for instance — , with more room for error, than Democrats do. But a path for Democrats does still exist.

The American Civil Liberties Union of Nevada filed a complaint on Monday with the Nevada Supreme Court seeking to stop a rural county from continuing its hand count of ballots, citing concerns that the process will be used to fuel misinformation about election security.
The group, which is suing Nye County, argued that hand counts “set a dangerous precedent for future elections by encouraging local officials to make up and implement their own vote-counting processes that violate voters’ constitutional right to an accurate election.”
Voter protection advocates from the A.C.L.U. and the Brennan Center, which also participated in the lawsuit and provided legal representation, are worried that the hand count, which was being conducted alongside the official count being done by machine, might produce faulty numbers that would provide fodder for conspiracy theorists.

Senate Democrats said Monday that they planned to hold a vote this week on legislation to provide federal protections for same-sex marriage, expressing fresh hopes that they could find the 10 Republican votes necessary to move it through the 50-50 Senate.
Leaders placed the measure on hold in September because of dimming hopes that they could draw enough Republican support to ensure its passage before the midterm elections. But fresh off a victory on Sunday that sealed their control of the Senate for the next Congress, Democrats were quick to resuscitate the bill as one of their first major agenda items, setting a test vote for Wednesday.
“I hope— for the sake of tens of millions of Americans— that at least 10 Republicans will vote with us to protect marriage equality into law soon,” Senator Chuck Schumer, the majority leader, said on Monday. “The rights and dignity of millions of Americans depends on it.”

ATLANTA — A state holiday that once honored the Confederate general Robert E. Lee could take away a day of early voting in some Georgia counties in the Senate runoff between Senator Raphael Warnock and Herschel Walker.
The holiday’s timing became an issue after Republicans passed a state voting law last year that cut in half the runoff election calendar in Georgia. The law also gave voters less time to request absentee ballots, enacted stricter identification requirements and substantially reduced the number of available ballot drop boxes.
Civil rights advocates and Democrats intensely criticized the law when it passed and now argue that its impact on the runoff’s voting rules and procedures will marginalize Georgians in many counties.

WASHINGTON — Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the minority leader, scrounged on Monday for the support he would need to become speaker if Republicans gain control of the House, facing resistance from a newly emboldened right flank as his party grappled with its historically weak performance in the midterm elections.
With the Senate in Democratic hands and control of the House still not secured, Mr. McCarthy’s troubles reflected disarray in his demoralized party and a fraught path ahead as former President Donald J. Trump prepared to announce a second run for the presidency.
Returning to Capitol Hill for a postelection session, Republicans began the week — which they had expected would be a triumphant victory lap — limping toward the finish of an election cycle that Mr. McCarthy had confidently predicted would be a G.O.P. bonanza. They were bitterly divided over who should lead what was .

A surprisingly nuanced verdict in the midterm elections has delivered at least one important conclusion about the state of the national mood: In battleground states and swing districts across the country, voters voiced their support for moderation.
That happened in Nevada’s Senate race, where Catherine Cortez Masto, an unassuming incumbent Democrat occupying one of the party’s most endangered seats, overcame voters’ economic fears and won re-election, highlighting her Republican opponent’s embrace of former President Donald J. Trump’s lies about the 2020 election and his denigration of abortion rights.
It happened in Pennsylvania, where the Democrat Josh Shapiro, facing the far-right Republican candidate Doug Mastriano, won the governor’s office in the biggest landslide for a non-incumbent in the state since 1946.

Midterm election results that defied expectations, leaving Democrats in control of the Senate and the House still up for grabs, have scrambled the agenda in Congress for the remainder of the year, leaving lawmakers toiling to determine how much can be accomplished in a brief year-end session that opens on Monday.
Senator Catherine Cortez Masto’s victory in Nevada on Saturday guaranteed that Democrats would retain control of the Senate next year, easing pressure to use the next several weeks to fill judicial vacancies for President Biden. And regardless of which party wins control of the House, Congress must enact legislation to keep the government funded past a mid-December deadline and to set defense policy for the coming year.
But the prospect of a Republican takeover of the House could fuel greater urgency among Democrats to act quickly in a so-called lame-duck session to raise the statutory debt limit, thus avoiding a partisan showdown next year that could roil financial markets and put the full faith and credit of the United States at risk.

That happened in Nevada’s Senate race, where Catherine Cortez Masto, an unassuming incumbent Democrat occupying one of the party’s most endangered seats, overcame voters’ economic fears and won re-election, highlighting her Republican opponent’s embrace of Donald J. Trump’s lies about the 2020 election and his denigration of abortion rights.
It happened in Pennsylvania, where Josh Shapiro, facing the far-right Doug Mastriano, won the governor’s office in the biggest landslide for a non-incumbent in the state since 1946.
And it happened on Sunday, when a liberal Democrat in Oregon who beat a veteran centrist House Democrat in the primary, Representative Kurt Schrader, lost the seat for her party to the G.O.P., a stinging blow to the Democrats’ chances of holding their majority.
In contests up and down the ballot, Republicans betting on a red wave instead received a sweeping rebuke from Americans who, for all the qualms polls show they have about Democratic governance, made clear they believe that the G.O.P. has become unacceptably extreme.
On a smaller scale, a similar dynamic could be discerned on the left: After Democratic primary voters chose more progressive nominees over moderates in a handful of House races including in Oregon, Texas and California, those left-leaning candidates were defeated or are at risk of losing seats that could have helped preserve a narrow Democratic majority.
But the 2022 midterm was the third straight federal election in which the march of many Republican candidates into a morass of conspiracy theories and far-right policy positions had grave electoral consequences for the G.O.P.
“The message on Tuesday was the average person is done voting for extremism,” said Representative Elissa Slotkin, a Democrat who ran for re-election in a Republican-leaning district in central Michigan on an explicitly centrist message, with the backing of a Republican, Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming. “They’re done with voting for people who just want to blow up the system.”
Republicans not only collapsed in governor’s races from Pennsylvania to Minnesota, but also lost House races they had targeted in those states, reflecting the political dangers of top-of-the-ticket candidates perceived as extreme or unserious, party strategists said.
And while Republicans may still capture the House, their efforts to win back the districts that powered the 2018 Democratic takeover of the chamber fell short in many races, while Democrats flipped a Senate seat in Pennsylvania.
Understand the Outcomes of the 2022 Midterm Elections
Card 1 of 7
What we know. It seemed as if the conditions were ripe for a red wave in the 2022 midterms, but in the end Republicans generated no more than a red ripple, leading to an improbable, still-undecided election. Here’s what the results tell us so far:
Biden beat the odds. President Biden had the best midterms of any president in 20 years, avoiding the losses his predecessors endured and maintaining the Democrats’ narrow hold on the Senate, which provides him with a critical guardrail against Republicans should they win the House.
G.O.P. faces a reckoning. A thin Republican majority in the House appears likely, but a poor midterms showing has the party wrestling with what went wrong: Was it bad candidates, bad messaging or the electoral anchor that appeared to be dragging the G.O.P. down, Donald J. Trump?
Trump under fire. Mr. Trump has faced unusual public attacks from within the G.O.P. after a string of losses by his handpicked candidates. There are also signs of an effort to inch the party away from the former president ahead of his expected announcement of a third White House bid.
Abortion mattered. In the first major election since the fall of Roe v. Wade, abortion rights broke through, as Democrats seized on the issue to hold off a red wave. In all five states where abortion-related questions were on the ballot, voters chose to protect access or reject further limits on it.
Voters rejected election deniers. Every 2020 election denier who sought to become the top election official in a critical battleground state lost at the polls this year. Voters roundly rejected extreme partisans who promised to restrict voting and overhaul the electoral process.
Ticket-splitters made a comeback. While ticket-splitting has declined substantially in recent elections, some voters seemed more inclined to support candidates of different parties this year, emphasizing candidate quality over partisan identity.
“Many Republicans know democracy’s at risk and that these extreme candidates are the reason,” said Gov. Roy Cooper of North Carolina, the chairman of the Democratic Governors Association.
Democrats had their share of missed opportunities, including in cases where their primary voters had elevated candidates from the liberal wing of their party instead of from the center.
In a competitive district outside Portland, Ore., Democratic primary voters in May turned out Mr. Schrader, a seven-term moderate incumbent, in favor of a considerably more liberal candidate, Jamie McLeod-Skinner. On Sunday, The Associated Press called the race for the Republican, Lori Chavez-DeRemer.
“We’re more divided than ever,” Mr. Schrader said in an interview on Sunday evening. “People are reverting to their tribal allegiances that are getting further right and further left. It’s not healthy for the country.”
In Texas’ Rio Grande Valley, along the border with Mexico, Democrats far exceeded expectations. But there, too, ideology played its part. Representative Henry Cuellar, a veteran conservative Democrat, beat back a spirited primary challenge from his left, then trounced his Republican opponent by 13 percentage points. In the district next door, Michelle Vallejo, an ardent progressive, beat a more moderate candidate in the Democratic primary by roughly 30 votes, then lost to a Republican, Monica De La Cruz, on Tuesday by 8.5 points.
And in northern Los Angeles County, the Democratic veterans’ group VoteVets, hoping to finally defeat Representative Mike Garcia, a Republican, in a strongly Democratic district, thought it had a dream candidate in John Quaye Quartey, the son of a Ghanaian immigrant who went to the Naval Academy to play football and had a 20-year career as a naval intelligence officer and military diplomat. Instead, Democratic Party leaders and primary voters fell in behind the more liberal Christy Smith, who had already lost to Mr. Garcia twice. She trails Mr. Garcia again.
“It’s super clear: Voters want mainstream and they do not want extreme,” said Matt Bennett, the co-founder of Third Way, a centrist Democratic organization. “Across the board, they went with the candidate who, fairly or unfairly, was seen as the champion of moderation.”
Underscoring that message, Adam Frisch, an independent-turned-Democrat from Aspen, Colo., squeaked by a much more liberal Democrat, Sol Sandoval, by 290 votes to challenge Representative Lauren Boebert, one of the most flamboyant torchbearers of Trumpism. Mr. Frisch is now within range of pulling off the biggest upset of the campaign after running as a pro-business, pro-energy production, “pro-normal party” moderate.
“The pro-normal party had legs all across the country,” Mr. Frisch said in an interview on Sunday. “People really want their representatives to play between the 30-yard lines,” not on the extremes.
Certainly, plenty of candidates with ties to the left or right prevailed. In Florida, Gov. Ron DeSantis flipped Miami-Dade County, which had not voted for a Republican candidate for governor in two decades, while Gov. Brian Kemp easily won re-election in Georgia. Neither man is closely tied to Mr. Trump — Mr. DeSantis is often mentioned as the leading alternative for the Republican presidential nomination — but both are staunch conservatives. And John Fetterman, the Pennsylvania Democrat who beat Mehmet Oz for a Senate seat, staked out a number of middle-of-the-road positions during the campaign, but as a 2016 supporter of Senator Bernie Sanders, he has long had credibility on the left.
For months before the 2022 midterm elections, Sarah Longwell, an anti-Trump Republican strategist, would ask her focus groups how they felt the nation was doing. Terribly, they’d say, citing the lingering pandemic, crime and the worst inflation rate in 40 years.
“Then I’d say, ‘Who are you going to vote for, Mark Kelly or Blake Masters?’” she said, referring to the Democratic and Republican Senate candidates in Arizona. “And they’d say, ‘Oh, Blake Masters is insane.’”
The issue, she said, was extremism, a catchall word that encompassed the Republican drive to ban abortions, violence in American politics, the denial of election results and what felt to some voters — in Arizona and elsewhere — like a drift away from fundamental rights and democracy itself. “I just think they didn’t like these candidates,” she said.
Mr. Masters lost to Mr. Kelly on Friday.
Representative Peter Meijer, a Michigan Republican who voted to impeach Mr. Trump and was ousted by a Trump-backed candidate in the primary — who then lost on Tuesday — pointed to concerns around Republican rhetoric, including the bizarre claim, given credence by some Republican candidates, that children were going beyond gender and identifying as cats who needed litter boxes in classrooms.

“Parents want their kids to be in school, they want their children to do well. In that, Republicans had a winning message,” Mr. Meijer said. “But when that Republican message then continues to veer into urban legends of litter boxes for children who identify as ‘furries,’ people start to doubt whether or not that person lives in the real world.”
Republicans remain bullish on their chances of retaking the House, even if by a narrower margin than many had predicted.
“House Republicans are pleased with the inroads we made in New York, the tough seats we held in California and the fact that we went from holding one seat in Iowa to holding all four seats in just two cycles,” Mike Berg, a spokesman for the House Republican campaign arm, said in a statement, as California results continued to be counted.
But in most battlegrounds, the vaunted red wave failed to materialize.
In Nevada, Democrats pounded the Republican Senate candidate Adam Laxalt for saying the Roe v. Wade decision that protected federal abortion rights was “a joke.”
“Abortion certainly was a factor in Nevada, but so was the economy,” said Representative Dina Titus, a Democrat who won a tough re-election battle in her Las Vegas-area district. “We talked a lot in all our races about the things that we had done over the last two years to bring this economy back.”
In Pennsylvania, the losses of Mr. Trump’s endorsed candidates for Senate and governor, Dr. Oz and Mr. Mastriano, seemed to ripple down.

“The lack of quality candidates at the top of the ticket, both Mastriano and Oz, severely hurt down-ballot candidates,” said Matt Brouillette, the head of Commonwealth Partners Chamber of Entrepreneurs, a conservative group whose political arm attacked Mr. Shapiro for part of the race.
Mr. Shapiro, who ran as a relative moderate with the backing of law enforcement groups, won by 14 percentage points in a state Mr. Biden won by one in 2020. Mr. Fetterman, who faced a Republican spending onslaught and defeated Dr. Oz more narrowly, also outperformed Mr. Biden.
“I wonder when all the Trump backers get tired of losing,” Mr. Brouillette added.
Representatives for Dr. Oz and Mr. Mastriano did not respond to requests for comment.
In Michigan, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer outpaced her 2018 margin, even though 2022 was a far more difficult political environment for Democrats. She said Michigan needed a “problem solver, not a culture warrior,” as she ran against Tudor Dixon, a Trump-endorsed Republican who embraced cultural battles.
In North Carolina, Wiley Nickel, a Democrat, beat an ardent Trump backer, Bo Hines, by presenting himself as a local, low-key problem-solver to voters who had grown tired of circus acts.
Republicans, he said, told him, “‘We’re voting for you, Wiley, because we know you, we know you will protect democracy, and sending someone to Washington who’s going to try to overturn the next election is just too far.’”

Ms. Slotkin of Michigan was facing voters in a newly drawn district that leaned more Republican than before, and she saw a political environment supercharged by a referendum on abortion rights. Her Republican opponent, State Senator Tom Barrett, tried to temper his views on abortion and tamped down questions he had earlier raised over the 2020 election.
But Ms. Slotkin tarred him with what she characterized as the extremism of the Republicans running for governor, secretary of state and attorney general.
“He was smart enough to know that extreme views wouldn’t fly in a swing district like ours, but he had a record,” she said in an interview.
Jason Cabel Roe, a Republican strategist who consulted for Mr. Barrett, acknowledged Republican problems with independent voters broadly.
“The Dobbs decision, you take the Jan. 6 stuff, you take the election denialism and wrap it all together, it’s not a good look for us,” he said, adding that he has long believed “we won’t win because we’re the prettier of the two parties, we’re going to win because we are the less ugly of the two parties. And I guess we were, for independent voters, the uglier of the two.”

Cranberry Lemon Bars

Cranberries that are quick-cooked into jam add a striking magenta color and complex tartness to these two-toned lemon bars. A thin layer of the classic lemon filling coats the cranberry mix like icing, and lemon zest boiled with the berries echoes the citrus taste of the lemony top. (Its pectin also thickens the jam.) To achieve a sturdy crust that isn’t tough, melted butter is stirred into a flour blend and simply patted into the pan. That vanilla cookie base, generously salted to balance the tangy sweetness on top, comes out crisp and holds up well even as the bars keep in the refrigerator for up to five days.

PREPARATION
Step 1
Start preparing the cranberry layer: Combine the cranberries, sugar and 3 tablespoons water in a medium saucepan. Zest 2 of the lemons directly into the saucepan; reserve the lemons. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally. Continue boiling, stirring occasionally, until the berries burst and the mixture is jammy, 7 to 9 minutes. Remove from the heat and reserve.
Step 2
Make the crust: Heat oven to 350 degrees. Line the bottom and sides of a 9-by-13-inch baking pan with one large sheet of heavy aluminum foil, making sure there are no gaps or holes, then generously coat with cooking spray.
Step 3
Whisk the flour, sugar and salt in a medium bowl. Whisk the vanilla into the butter, then pour over the flour mixture. Stir until the dough comes together in a mass. Press into an even layer in the prepared pan. Bake until golden brown around the edges and dry and golden on top, 17 to 20 minutes.
Step 4
While the crust bakes, begin preparing the lemon layer: Squeeze the juice from the 2 reserved zested lemons. You should have ½ cup. Squeeze the juice from another lemon, if needed.
Step 5
Whisk the sugar, flour and salt in a medium bowl. Add the eggs and whisk gently just until incorporated. Add the lemon juice and stir gently with the whisk just until smooth.
Step 6
Let the crust cool for 5 minutes, then spread the cranberry mixture evenly over the crust. Carefully and slowly pour the lemon mixture on top to create two distinct layers.
Step 7
Return the pan to the oven and bake until the filling is set, 18 to 22 minutes. Cool completely in the pan on a wire rack, then refrigerate until cold and firm, at least 2 hours. Using the foil, slide the bars out of the pan and onto a cutting board. Cut into 24 squares, wiping your knife between cuts for clean slices. If desired, sift confectioners’ sugar over the tops just before serving.

After the berries had begun to pop, I used an immersion blender to purée the cranberry sauce and cooked in on simmer for approximately 30 minutes until it was very think and jammy. Spread the cranberry sauce over the baked crust an allowed it to cool for 15-20 mins before pouring the lemon custard on top. This resulted in attractive, distinct layers of fruit when the bars were sliced.

Can the sugar be reduced in the cranberry filling? Usually when I make whole cranberry sauce, I use much less sugar and it gels nicely when chilled. Still spreadable.
