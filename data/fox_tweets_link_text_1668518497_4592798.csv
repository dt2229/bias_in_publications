He was listed as questionable coming into the game and missed two practices.Tannehill was active for the game, but it was unclear whether he was going to start.

 Facebook Twitter Instagram RSS Email Texas Published November 13, 2022 12:14pm EST Gov. Abbott's drubbing of Beto O'Rourke dashes Dem hopes of flipping Texas blue O'Rourke underperformed his 2018 Senate numbers across the state in 2022 
 By
 Michael Lee | Fox News Facebook Twitter Flipboard Comments Print Email close Video Greg Abbott on Latino shift to GOP: They aren't singular voters Texas Gov. Greg Abbott joined 'The Ingraham Angle' to weigh in on the importance of the Latino vote and why they are shifting towards the Republican Party. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott cruised to a re-election victory in Tuesday's midterms, dealing another blow to Democratic aspirations of taking control of the longtime Republican stronghold.Abbott defeated Democratic challenger Beto O'Rourke by 11 percentage points in Tuesday's election, according to The Associated Press's unofficial results, only about two points less than the incumbent governor won by in 2018.The result comes as many Democrats have eyed Texas in recent years, hoping to flip a state that has been dominated by Republicans for decades. Democrats have pointed to the states changing demographics as a reason for optimism, noting the growing percentage of Hispanic voters and urban areas that have seen an influx of new residents from around the country.O'Rourke has twice been tasked with turning Texas blue in statewide elections, first running against incumbent Sen. Ted Cruz in the 2018 midterm elections. O'Rourke came close to making the dream a reality, losing to Cruz narrowly, albeit in a year with a favorable climate for Democrats.HERE'S HOW MUCH CAMPAIGN CASH BETO O'ROURKE HAS BURNED LOSING RACES UP AND DOWN THE BALLOT 
 Beto O'Rourke and Gov. Greg Abbott
 (Getty Images)But the optimism brought on by that narrow 2018 decision quickly fizzled last week, with O'Rourke underperforming his Senate bid in virtually every region of the state.O'Rourke ran up large victories in the state's southwest border counties in 2018, taking 72% of the vote in Maverick County, 71% in Dimmitt, 71% in Webb, 77% in Starr, and 69% in Hidalgo. The numbers were much better than his performance against Abbott in 2022, with O'Rourke only winning those counties with 58%, 61%, 61%, 58%, and 59% respectively. Abbott was even able to flip Zapata County, which O'Rourke won with 63% of the vote in 2018, with 53% of voters there choosing the incumbent governor.

 (Yasin Ozturk/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images)Smaller declines were also prevalent for O'Rourke in the state's urban Democratic strongholds. The Democratic candidate captured 60% of the vote in San Antonio's Bexar County in 2018, 57% and 74% in Austin's Hays and Travis Counties, 56% and 58% in Houston's Fort Bend and Harris Counties, and 66% in Dallas County. But in 2022, O'Rourke was only able to win 57%, 55%, 73%, 52%, 54% and 63% respectively. Even worse for O'Rourke, turnout in the state's urban areas was down significantly from 2018, denying the Democratic candidate the crucial opportunity to run up large margins of raw votes. In Houston's Harris County, turnout was down nearly 10%, while turnout in Dallas County declined about 15%, signaling a potential lack of enthusiasm for the Democratic candidate.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.Seattle Seahawks star DK Metcalf was hit with an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty for apparently pointing at an official as he looked for a pass interference call in the third quarter of the game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in Munich, Germany, Sunday, Nov. 13, 2022.Geno Smith was trying to find Metcalf to set up a red zone play down 14 points in the second half. But Metcalf was defended and failed to come up with the catch. As he looked for a flag on the Buccaneers’ defensive back, Metcalf went back to the huddle and pointed at one of the officials.CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM

 (Kirby Lee-USA Today Sports) It’s unclear what was said, but it couldn’t have been good. The official threw the penalty flag, and it made things more difficult for Seahawks kicker Jason Myers to make a field goal.Luckily, Myers nailed the 55-yarder to cut the deficit to 10 points with about 12:05 to play in the quarter. At that point, Metcalf was leading Seattle with four catches for 45 yards on six targets, but the Seahawks hadn’t found the end zone.NFL WEEK 10 PREVIEW: BUCS TAKE ON SEAHAWKS IN GERMANY; MIKE MCCARTHY RETURNS TO LAMBEAU

 Fox News Staff | Fox News Facebook Twitter Flipboard Comments Print Email close Video Dan Bongino: Things haven't gotten bad enough to wake people up Fox News host Dan Bongino breaks down why things need to get worse before voters elect Republicans to clean up Democrats' crises after the GOP's midterm results on 'Unfiltered.'Fox News host Dan Bongino reacts to the Republicans Party's Election Day results on ""Unfiltered with Dan Bongino,"" saying things will have to worsen before any improvement comes.DAN BONGINO: You know the old adage: History doesn't repeat itself, but it rhymes. You've heard it a million times — it's because it's true. Things are just not bad enough yet for a lot of people to wake up from the Kool-Aid slumber. It's just that simple. That's why Republicans had a decent day this week. I'm not buying the apocalyptic, Chicken Little nonsense, but it could have been a better day — I accept that — than we were hoping for. REPUBLICANS SPLIT ON TRUMP'S EFFECT ON LACKLUSTER MIDTERMS AS CONTROL OF CONGRESS HANGS IN BALANCEWe were hoping for the best. We got an OK day. Yeah, inflation is at record highs, the border is wide open, the fentanyl crisis is wiping out kids across the country. Crime is surging in liberal cities and the economy is in the gutter. Big government is trying to silence your voice, but apparently, all of this bad stuff just ain't bad enough. Unfortunately, folks, bad stuff in these crises are going to get worse before some voters realize that it's the left's fault. I have lived through this before. The only question is: How much worse is it going to get? 
 House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy of Calif., speaks at an event early Wednesday morning, Nov. 9, 2022, in Washington. 
 ((AP Photo/Alex Brandon))2022 MIDTERM ELECTION RESULTS…Folks, it's time for Republicans to deliver, deliver like DeSantis and deliver like Giuliani did. The stump speeches are over, talking time's over, cutesy time's done. The one-liners don't cut it anymore. This isn't a time for focus groups. It's time for action. We're giving Republicans another chance now to stop the insanity of the left, but also to reform — reform our government. We need it. If we've ever need it, we need it now. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPIf conservatives in Congress don't reform this, none of that stuff matters. It's time to put the money where your mouths are right now. It's time for you to deliver what we, the people, want and voted for. This article was written by Fox News staff.

 Fox News Staff | Fox News Facebook Twitter Flipboard Comments Print Email close Video Brian Kilmeade: How will no changes pan out for Americans? 'One Nation' host Brian Kilmeade weighs in on President Biden's agenda following the 2022 midterm elections in Saturday's opening monologue.Fox News host Brian Kilmeade issued concern over President Biden's lack of having plans to make changes to his administrative agenda following the 2022 midterm elections on Saturday's ""One Nation.""BRIAN KILMEADE: I want to talk about change or lack thereof. The midterm elections are really important. It's an important time for the United States traditionally — you know, the first opportunity for the American people to look at their chief executive and let them know what they think of his policies, win or lose. The midterms could be the most beneficial for the president overall. They give a clear picture as to what voters want — a formula for re-election, perhaps, a chance to change before it's too late. That's why I find it extremely noteworthy and scary that the president of the United States, who narrowly avoided a red wave, granted, but not a shift in power, has no plans for change. BIDEN VOWS ‘NOTHING’ DIFFERENT IN NEXT TWO YEARS DESPITE MAJORITY SAYING US HEADED IN ‘WRONG DIRECTION’  
 President Joe Biden speaks at the UNFCCC COP27 climate conference on November 11, 2022 in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt. (Photo by Sean Gallup/Getty Images) 
 (Sean Gallup/Getty Images)…That's right — no change. Biden has no plans to bring down inflation, to spend less, to drill more, to rein in on violent crime or fix this country's broken borders. He's caught up in the lack of a red wave, but his popularity continues to fade. Only 25% of the country thinks we are heading in the right direction… So how will no changes for the American people pan out for the Biden administration overall come 2024? CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP This article was written by Fox News staff.

 Facebook Twitter Instagram RSS Email Midterm Elections Published November 13, 2022 10:11am EST Governors opposed to draconian lockdowns increased margins of victory in 2022 Governors who resisted lockdowns increased their average margin of victory 14.4 percentage points 
 By
 Michael Lee | Fox News Facebook Twitter Flipboard Comments Print Email close Video How Gov. Ron DeSantis turned Florida red A swing state no more, and new talk of 2024. Governors who were fast to oppose pandemic lockdowns and reopen their states were able to win re-election easily in the 2022 midterms, increasing their margin of victory over their 2018 performances.Govs. Ron DeSantis of Florida, Kristi Noem of South Dakota, Kim Reynolds of Iowa, Jared Polis of Colorado and Brian Kemp of Georgia all cruised to re-election in Tuesday's midterms, winning by an average of 18.1 percentage points. The margins of victory for the anti-lockdown governors stood in stark contrast to their narrower victories in 2018 when the same five candidates won by an average margin of 3.7 percentage points.DeSantis provided perhaps the most stunning turnaround in 2022, winning re-election by 19.4 percentage points. The popular Republican barely won his first bid for governor in 2018, winning by just 0.4 percentage points.The Florida governor was famously opposed to strict lockdown measures for much of the COVID-19 pandemic. Though he ordered a stay-at-home order in the early days of the pandemic on April 2, 2020, DeSantis lifted the order just over a month later on May 4.LEARNING LOSS FROM COVID LOCKDOWNS CAUSED 'UNMITIGATED DISASTER' PARTICULARLY IN STUDENT BEHAVIOR: EXPERTS 
 Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis
 (James Gilbert/Getty Images)Florida schools also shut down in-person instruction in March 2020, though all the state's public schools were re-opened to in-person instruction by the end of the school year. Public schools were then required to reopen for in-person instruction at the beginning of the following school year, with DeSantis resisting calls to close them down through various waves of COVID-19 infections in the state.Last month, the Republican touted the results of his push to reopen schools.""In Florida our 4th grade students rank #3 in Reading and #4 in Math, achieving top 4 in both English and Math for the first time in state history, while lockdown California and New York aren’t even in the top 30,"" DeSantis said in a statement last month.In South Dakota, Noem also cruised to an easy victory last week, winning re-election by 26.8 percentage points. The race was much different than her 2018 victory, which saw the Republican win by just 3.4 percentage points.BLUE STATE COVID LEARNING LOSS WIDENED RACIAL ACHIEVEMENT GAPS RELATIVE TO RED STATES: STUDY 
 South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem
 (AP Photo/John Raoux)Noem became a leader of the anti-lockdown movement early in the pandemic. The South Dakota governor never issued a stay-at-home order. Though Noem ordered schools to close in March 2020 and extended that order through the end of the school year in May, the state reopened its schools to in-person instruction by the start of the next school year. Like DeSantis, Noem resisted calls to close schools again during waves of positive cases in the state.Noem publicly defended her approach throughout the pandemic, going so far as to criticize other Republicans governors who issued what she called ""useless"" lockdowns.""We’ve got Republican governors across this country pretending they didn’t shut down their states; that they didn’t close their regions; that they didn’t mandate masks, that they didn’t need to issue shelter in places,"" Noem said last year. ""South Dakota did not do any of those… we didn’t mandate. We trusted our people and told them that personal responsibility was the best answer,""In Iowa, Reynolds took a similar approach and did not issue a stay-at-home order early in the pandemic. The Republican governor did order schools to close across the state in April 2020, an order that was extended through the end of the school year. She began pushing for schools to reopen at the beginning of the next school year and signed legislation requiring schools open to in-person instruction in January 2021. 
 Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds
 (AP Photo/Charlie Neibergall, File)REMOTE LEARNING DURING CORONAVIRUS CAUSED STRESS, ANXIETY IN STUDENTS, SURVEY FINDSThe governor's approach to the pandemic proved popular, with Reynolds winning re-election by 18.6 percentage points. The victory was 15.8 percentage points better than her 2018 performance when she won by a narrow 2.8 percentage points.In Georgia, Kemp won his rematch with Democratic candidate Stacey Abrams by 7.6 percentage points. The margin was far more comfortable than his 2018 victory over the same opponent, which he won by just 1.4 percentage points.Kemp did issue a stay-at-home order in response to the pandemic on April 2, 2020, but lifted it by the end of the month. Kemp ordered schools in the state to close in March 2020, an order that was extended through the end of the school year. Kemp then began a push to reopen schools in the state, with half of the schools in Georgia opening by the start of the next school year and most of the state's schools being opened to in-person instruction at the conclusion of the same year. 
 Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp
 (Joe Raedle/Getty Images)Kemp also took on school masking requirements, signing a bill in March of this year that allowed parents to exempt their children from wearing masks in districts with mandates.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP""This will ensure that parents have the final say when it comes to the health and well-being of their child,"" Kemp said at the time. ""It is a common sense measure that puts parents in charge — not the government.""In Colorado, Polis issued one of the briefest stay-at-home orders of the country's Democratic governors in 2020, shutting down the state on March 26 but reopening it a month later. Polis also took a less strict approach than his Democratic peers to school closings, shutting down the state's schools for the remainder of the school year in April but allowing districts to make their own choice on in-person instruction for the start of the next school year. 
 Colorado Gov. Jared Polis
 (Andy Cross/The Denver Post via Getty Images)The governor's performance during the pandemic was rewarded by Colorado voters, who re-elected Polis by 18.1 percentage points. The performance was 7.5 percentage points better than his 2018 run for governor when Polis won by 10.6 percentage points.""I don't think this is about stay-at-homes or lockdowns anymore,"" Polis said in November 2020 amid pressure to issue new lockdown orders as COVID-19 cases surged in Colorado.

 By
 Shiv Sudhakar | Fox News Facebook Twitter Flipboard Comments Print Email close Video What is multiple sclerosis? Multiple sclerosis: symptoms and treatments Actress Christina Applegate apparently overlooked the early symptoms of multiple sclerosis (MS) before she was diagnosed last summer while on the set of the third and final season of ""Dead To Me,"" which will drop on Netflix Nov. 17. ""I got diagnosed while we were working,"" the Emmy winner recently told Variety during an interview.""I had to call everybody and be like, ‘I have multiple sclerosis, guys.’""CHRISTINA APPLEGATE REVEALS ROLE ON ‘DEAD TO ME’ MAY BE LAST DUE TO MS DIAGNOSIS She added, ""And then it was about kind of learning — all of us learning — what I was going to be capable of doing.""The 50-year-old gained fame as the ditzy daughter in the raunchy TV comedy ""Married … With Children,"" but continued to show her versatility in acting with shows like ""Friends"" to popular movies like ""Anchorman."" 
 Christina Applegate attends Netflix's ""Dead To Me"" season 1 premiere at The Broad Stage on May 2, 2019, in Santa Monica, California. 
 (Presley Ann/Getty Images)For her work, she is being honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on Nov. 14.She is opening up about her early signs and symptoms of MS.What is MS?Multiple sclerosis is a neurological disease of the brain and spinal cord, which together make up the central nervous system that controls everything we do, according to the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. Although it’s unclear what causes the disease, something triggers the immune system to attack the nervous system, the group also says.CHRISTINA APPLEGATE SAYS ‘IMPORTANT CEREMONY’ WILL BE HER FIRST TIME OUT SINCE MS DIAGNOSISThat attack on the nervous system causes damage to the protective outer covering of the nerve fibers, known as myelin, as well as the nerve fiber themselves. 
 This image provided by U.S. Department of Health and Human Services shows an illustration of the outer coating of the Epstein-Barr virus, one of the world’s most common viruses. New research has shown stronger evidence that the Epstein-Barr infection could set some people on the path to later developing multiple sclerosis.  
 (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services via AP)Nerves send electrical signals that help us feel sensations and move muscles in the body.MS disrupts the transmission of these nerve signals between the brain, spinal cord and the rest of the body, per the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. Each patient’s experience with MS is different. ""This interruption of communication signals causes unpredictable symptoms such as numbness, tingling, mood changes, memory problems, pain, fatigue, blindness and/or paralysis,"" the society noted on its website.However, each patient’s experience with MS is different.Signs and symptoms""Multiple sclerosis should be suspected when a younger person develops neurologic symptoms,"" said Dr. Jai S. Perumal, assistant professor of neurology at the Weill Cornell Medical College in New York City. She relates it to ""the way one suspects stroke when an older person"" develops neurological symptoms.Most people with MS experience early symptoms as young adults, typically between the ages of 20 and 40, according to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. 
 Most patients with MS — in addition to experiencing issues with their vision — also experience muscle weakness in their arms or legs and difficulty with balance that can become so severe they have trouble walking or standing. 
 (iStock)One common early symptom includes difficulty with vision, such as blurry vision or even blindness in one eye, the same source added. Most patients also experience muscle weakness in their arms or legs and difficulty with balance that can become so severe they have trouble walking or standing. ""MS can present with isolated eye vision loss, numbness, tingling in your face [and] double vision, usually lasting for days and not hours or minutes,"" said Dr. Michael G. Ho, assistant clinical professor of neurology at UCLA in California.‘KISSING DISEASE’ AMONG TEENAGERS MAY TRIGGER MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS: REPORTApplegate said she was ""sleeping all the time"" after her diagnosis and was using a wheelchair to get around on set because it was difficult to walk, according to Variety.Symptoms are subtle, often missed But these symptoms are nonspecific and subtle, so they can be initially dismissed by patients. ""Approximately half of all people with MS experience cognitive impairments such as difficulties with concentration, attention, memory and poor judgment, but such symptoms are usually mild and are frequently overlooked,"" according to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke’s website.""Sometimes when the symptoms are mild and people fully recover, they might decide not to see a doctor."" Applegate remembers having balance issues while filming a dance sequence on the first season of ""Dead To Me"" before being officially diagnosed, according to The New York Times.""I wish I had paid attention,"" she told the publication. ""But who was I to know?""She later noticed her tennis game began to suffer, but she didn’t connect it to a medical issue, the same report noted. 
 Christina Applegate attends the 25th Annual Critics' Choice Awards at Barker Hangar on Jan. 12, 2020, in Santa Monica, California. 
 (Jeff Kravitz/FilmMagic)But Applegate’s experience can be a common one for other MS patients.""Sometimes when the symptoms are mild and people fully recover, they might decide not to see a doctor because they attributed it to any number of causes, including ‘pinched nerve,’ stress, etc.,"" Perumal told Fox News Digital.Some cases, however, may lead to partial or complete paralysis, the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke noted on its website.Most patients experience temporary numbness, prickling or ""pins and needles"" sensations.CHRISTINA APPLEGATE MS DIAGNOSIS: WHAT ARE THE WARNING SIGNS?Applegate told the Times she began having numbness and tingling in her extremities that worsened over several years before she was finally diagnosed last year.Other hallmark symptoms include pain, difficulty speaking, tremors or dizziness.A diagnosis of MS""A diagnosis of MS is made based MRI findings,"" Perumal added. ""A spinal tap is necessary only if the MRI is inconclusive.""An MS patient may only have symptoms temporarily — and then those symptoms partly or completely resolve over time. But then they can ""relapse.""

 Cara Dutton is married to Jacob Dutton, the uncle to John Dutton, who owns the family ranch in ""Yellowstone.""
 (James Minchin III/Paramount+)Speaking to Vanity Fair about their characters, Mirren reveals that she and Ford are childless in the show, but very much in love.""They’ve been married a long time. They haven’t had children, so they haven’t had the sense of children holding them together,"" Mirren explained.""An incredible partnership where you can be honest with each other, and your love and support of each other is total, but at the same time you are no longer blinded by love or by lust,"" is how she would describe the Dutton's relationship. ""You’re much more clear-eyed about your relationship, but the relationship becomes all the stronger for that very reason.""Ford echoed her sentiments, saying his and Mirren's characters are ""totally wrapped up in each other."" 
 Harrison Ford will star as Jacob Dutton, the brother to James and Claire Dutton.

It is a tough life, and it’s full of not just physical challenges but moral ones as well,"" Harrison said.In developing her character, Mirren noted that she sees Cara as having emigrated to Montana from Ireland. ""One of the things I very strongly wanted was that she would speak with an Irish accent, not with an American accent. It’s always slightly annoyed me with Westerns that you have all these people speaking with modern American accents when in fact so many of them were fairly recent immigrants,"" she said. 
 Helen Mirren says her character is an Irish immigrant.
 (James Minchin III/Paramount+)CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTERMirren expanded, saying ""The big Irish immigration to America, because of the potato famine, was in the late 19th century. That absolutely chronologically works for Cara. She’s now in her late 60s, we imagine. So she would’ve come, I think, as a young woman from Ireland. I think that’s one of the extraordinary elements of America. The people who arrived, and are still arriving, are people with enormous resilience and enormous courage and independence.""Ford's character for his part is the brother to James and Claire Dutton. 
 Harrison Ford calls his character the ""silverback"" of the family.

 By
 Marcus Brotherton | Fox News Facebook Twitter Flipboard Comments Print Email close Video WWII veterans met 'Band of Brothers' actors at D-Day's 75th anniversary in 2019 WWII veterans and 'Band of Brothers' actors unite at Utah Beach.NEWYou can now listen to Fox News articles!
 This past July 3, 2022, a soft-spoken him him him Mississippi farmer named Bradford Freeman, age 97, quietly passed into eternity. This Veterans Day weekend, it’s worth remembering this American hero — and all he stood for.  Significantly, Freeman was the last surviving member of Easy Company, 506th PIR, 101st Airborne — the legendary World War II paratroopers known as the Band of Brothers.  Our culture will be poorer without them. In an age where it’s become commonplace to be obnoxious and divisive, the Band of Brothers set the standard for noble living. During World War II, they battled oppression with courage and honor. In post-war America, they modeled service to our country with excellence, dignity and unity.  MEET THE AMERICAN WHO INSPIRED THE NATION IN TWO WORLD WARS: CHRISTIAN SOLDIER SGT. ALVIN YORKI spent more than six years interviewing the Band of Brothers and writing about them. I met many of them in person, along with their spouses, children and grandchildren, at reunions and in their homes.   
 Bradford Freeman passed away in July, the last member of Easy Company.
 (PHOTO: Courtesy Joe Muccia)They were the real deal. The Band of Brothers formed at Camp Toccoa, Georgia, under the tough and controversial Captain Herbert Sobel. After training stateside, the men rode the troop ship, Samaria, to Aldbourne, England, for further battle preparation.  They parachuted into Normandy on D-Day and later jumped into Holland for Operation Market Garden.  They fought their way through Belgium, France and Germany, survived overwhelming odds, liberated concentration camps, and drank a victory toast in April 1945 at Hitler’s hideout in the Alps.   VideoAlong the way, they encountered horrors and victories and welded themselves into a family. They helped swing the tide of World War II, and ultimately the course of history.  The first significant chronicle of their story was the 1992 book by historian Stephen Ambrose, ""Band of Brothers."" In 2001, Tom Hanks and Stephen Spielberg turned Ambrose’s book into a ten-part HBO miniseries by the same name. The series won six Emmys and numerous other awards, and still runs frequently on various networks around the world.  After the war, and particularly after the series soared, many of the men became household names. Their qualities became measures of greatness.  Major Dick Winters was known for his impeccable leadership. He modeled grace under fire, solid character, and unswerving integrity.

He prosecuted Sirhan Sirhan for the murder of Bobby Kennedy.  Shifty Powers, a backwoods machinist from the small coal-mining town of Clinchco, Virginia, proved that every person, no matter how unassuming, can lead an extraordinary life.  When describing his former enemies, Powers famously said, ""That man and I might have been good friends.

 By
 Christine Rousselle | Fox News Facebook Twitter Flipboard Comments Print Email close Video The rosary is a weapon of prayer: Tom Shillue Greg Gutfeld and guests discus the Atlantic article saying how rosary beads have been ‘woven into absolutist gun culture’ on ‘Gutfeld!’Scores of Catholics and other practicing Christians pray the rosary all year long — and many bestow gifts of rosaries on family and friends for Christmas and other special occasions.What is the rosary, exactly — and how do the faithful use its beads?""The rosary is a combination of vocal prayer (the Our Fathers and Hail Marys) and of mental prayer — namely, reflection on important events in the life of Christ and His Mother,"" according to the website for the Rosary Center & Confraternity, a ministry of the Dominicans of the Province of the Holy Name of Jesus, in Portland, Oregon. CAMPOS-DUFFY WARNS CHRISTIANITY UNDER ATTACK AFTER THE ATLANTIC CALLS THE ROSARY AN ‘EXTREMIST SYMBOL’The founder of the Dominican Order, St. Dominic, helped to popularize the rosary in the 13th century, the website also notes.History of the rosary""St. Dominic was distressed at his lack of success in his preaching in countering heresy, and in his desperation turned to the Mother of God for help,"" the Rosary Center notes. MARY, MOTHER OF JESUS, WALKED THE PATH OF ALL STRUGGLING MOTHERS TODAYThis heresy ""wrongly taught that all material things, including the human body itself, were fundamentally evil,"" according to Catholic.org. 
 Rosary beads help a person keep place in the prayer, says the Rosary Center.
 (Dan Kitwood/Getty Images)""She appeared to him (according to the tradition) and told him to use her Psalter in conjunction with his preaching of the mysteries of our salvation, as an instrument in combating the great heresy of his day.""Since then, the rosary and rosary beads have been associated with the Dominican Order — and modern-day Dominican friars and sisters wear a set of rosary beads as part of their habits. The meditative aspects of the rosary help immerse a person in prayer. A set of rosary beads today includes 50 smaller beads divided into groups of 10 by a larger bead, along with a pendant consisting of a cross and five additional smaller beads, explains the website. KIDS NEED PRAYERS! THESE FAITHFUL DEVOTIONS MAY HELP BLESS OUR CHILDREN""When one refers to the rosary"" — meaning the prayer itself, which is sometimes capitalized — ""it is usually understood to mean five decades, or one fourth of the entire rosary,"" the site says. The full rosary prayer involves 20 decades, each meditating on a different supernatural mystery associated with Jesus Christ's life, death, resurrection and earthly ministry.

 (The Associated Press/Gregorio Borgia)Each decade of the rosary involves saying 10 Hail Mary prayers while meditating on one mystery, says the Rosary Center website.Due to the length of the prayer, the faithful may opt to use rosary beads in order to track their place. A Hail Mary is prayed on each of the smaller beads, and an Our Father (also known as ""The Lord's Prayer"") is prayed on the larger.  The five ""Joyful Mysteries"" about Jesus' birth and early life are traditionally prayed on Mondays and Saturdays, while the five ""Sorrowful Mysteries"" concerning the crucifixion of Jesus are traditionally prayed on Tuesdays and Fridays.SURFER BETHANY HAMILTON PUSHES PAST FEAR, TAKES ON NEW ADVENTUREThe five ""Glorious Mysteries"" regarding the resurrection of Christ are traditionally said on Wednesdays and Sundays — and the five ""Luminous Mysteries"" are prayed on Thursdays, according to the website.Recent additions to the rosaryInitially, the rosary prayer contained only 15 mysteries – the Joyful, Sorrowful and Glorious, Fr. Christopher M. Zelonis, pastor of Saints Peter and Paul Parish in Lehighton, Pennsylvania, told Fox News Digital.Praying the 15 original mysteries involved reciting 150 Hail Mary prayers, a number that corresponds to the number of psalms in the Book of Psalms.   ""St. John Paul II’s letter ‘Rosarium Virginis Mariae’ in 2000 added the Mysteries of Light ('Luminous') to the 15 traditional mysteries,"" he said. 
 ""When one refers to the rosary"" — meaning the prayer — ""it is usually understood to mean five decades, or one fourth of the entire rosary,"" says the Rosary Center in Portland, Oregon.

Zelonis said he is fond of using a scriptural rosary, which contains a passage to meditate on while praying. These can be found both printed and online, he said. The meditative aspects of the rosary help immerse a person in prayer, said Zelonis. This is in comparison to the ""pre-fab prayers"" that are also part of church tradition.  
 The rosary, said one Rhode Island worshiper, is ""a wonderful meditation, a way to focus, to draw closer to Jesus."" 
 (Associated Press)Pre-written prayers ""are best supplemented by our own meditation, by which God can lend some depth to our understanding and love of Jesus and Mary,"" he said.""We can put ourselves in the biblical scene or envision it as if watching a film."" Another addition to the traditional rosary prayer is the inclusion of the optional ""Fatima prayer"" after each decade. The ""Fatima prayer"" originates from a reported 1917 apparition of the Virgin Mary in Fatima, Portugal, according to the Rosary Center website.  Historical connectionsOctober is known as the month of the rosary thanks in part to St. Pius V, a 16th-century pope, said Father William G. Most in his book, ""Mary in Our Life."" AMERICANS RECITE BIBLE'S NEW TESTAMENT IN HISTORIC EVENT: ‘THE GREAT RECITAL’""St. Pius V attributed the great defeat of the Turkish fleet on the first Sunday of October 1571, to the fact that at the same time the rosary confraternities at Rome and elsewhere were holding their processions,"" said Most. ""Calling in some help from Mary seems like a perfectly logical move."" Afterward, St. Pius V ordered a commemoration of the rosary to mark that day, and a feast day was later added to the church's calendar. Today, October 7 is known as the ""Feast of Our Lady of the Rosary"" and is marked by prayers and public processions.

 Facebook Twitter Instagram RSS Email OPINION Published November 13, 2022 8:00am EST What is Putin thinking? Where the Russia-Ukraine war stands nine months after invasion Putin is prepared for the long-haul in his war against Ukraine 
 By
 Rebekah Koffler | Fox News Facebook Twitter Flipboard Comments Print Email close Video Rebekah Koffler: Russian withdrawal from Kherson is probably a ruse to lure Ukrainian forces into a trap Former U.S. intel officer Rebekah Koffler reacts to the Russian government's failure to inform the Biden White House of Brittney Griner’s transfer to a penal colony last week on 'Fox News Live.'NEWYou can now listen to Fox News articles!
 Washington will soon debate sending billions more to Ukraine to assist its war effort. Lawmakers may want to first conduct a reality check on where Russia stands in this nine-month war and on Putin’s decision calculus. This suggests that U.S. funding will not produce quick results, may not produce any results or may also produce very bad results for America and Ukraine.This is how, when wishful thinking is set aside, things actually look:The BattlefieldMultiple areas across Ukraine are still under Russian assault, even as Ukrainian forces are gaining momentum with an effective counter-offensive, pushing to reclaim territories captured by Russia. On Friday, special units of Ukraine’s armed forces entered the strategic city of Kherson in southern Ukraine, following the retreat of the Russian troops as directed by the Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu. As Ukraine’s president Zelenskyy was championing another victory, the Kremlin warned that Kherson’s status didn’t change, despite the retreat, claiming that the city was still ‘part of Russia.’The Russians are unlikely to permanently abandon Kherson or any of the three regions that Moscow recently ""annexed."" The Russian ground forces who assumed defensive positions on the left bank of the Dniepr River, will probably not engage in a mano-a-mano battle with Ukrainians, having lost so many men and so much military hardware. The withdrawal is a potential ruse to lure Ukrainian troops into a radioactive chamber. Russian Spetsnaz operatives reportedly left a nasty message on a door of one of the buildings. Addressed to Ukrainians, the message warned that this was ""the territory of the Russian Empire,"" that Putin was ""our and your Czar"" and that the Russian troops went ""on vacation."" 
 Vladimir Putin and his Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu stand together during a Navy Day Parade in Saint Petersburg, Russia in July.
 (Photo by Contributor/Getty Images)PUTIN’S CYBER ARMAGEDDON DOCTRINE SEEKS TO EXPAND RUSSIA'S OFFENSE BEYOND BATTLEFIELDFor weeks, Moscow has been accusing Kyiv of planning to use a ""dirty bomb,"" also called a radiological dispersal device (RDD), an improvised nuclear device containing dynamite laced with radioactive powder. Unlike traditional nuclear bombs, RDDs have low military value but produce panic and terror in the opposing force and population. They cause severe burns, irradiation sickness, and they contaminate food and water. Driving Ukrainians out of the region by contamination would be consistent with Russia’s most recent military doctrine, which envisions use of radiological, chemical and biological warfare for ""defensive"" purposes. The Russians have a special military branch, Radiological, Chemical and Biological Defense Forces (RKhBZ), that are trained in decontamination and clean up.A New Strategy of Indirect ActionRussia has all but exhausted its conventional combat power, having fired around 4,000 missiles and, according to Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley, have lost some 100,000 personnel to death or injury. Morale is low. Special units are sent to the front lines to shoot retreating soldiers and deserters. Multiple Russian commanders have failed to secure victory.However, despite Washington’s expectations, Putin will not abandon the fight. His regime views the stakes as existential for him and for Russia. Moscow wants Ukraine to remain part of its strategic security perimeter, on which it relied for centuries. Putin will continue to enforce his version of the Monroe Doctrine to keep NATO troops and influence out of a country that has a 1400-mile border with Russia. 
 President Biden and his Russia counterpart Vladimir Putin have not spoken in months. 
 (Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images | Photo by Mikhail Svetlov/Getty Images)FIVE REASONS WHY BIDEN MUST MOVE TO DE-ESCALATE THE RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR NOWUnder the new ""asymmetric"" strategy, Moscow is targeting critical infrastructure to leave Ukrainians without water, electricity and heat as winter approaches. Missile and drone strikes on Kyiv’s electrical grid have left half a million homes without power. Local authorities are mulling evacuation plans should the city become unlivable.Forty percent of the country’s energy infrastructure has been crippled, and multiple industries have incurred devastating cyber strikes. Loss of power will result in lack of water, causing sewage problems that will spread disease. In late October, Ukraine’s intelligence services uncovered Russia’s plot to blow up the Nova Kakhovka hydroelectric dam to trigger a massive flood in southern Ukraine. Couple that with a dirty bomb in Kherson, and a large swath of the country will become an environmental disaster. The main target in this phase of war is the population, its psychological state and its will to fight.Putin’s Health and Regime StabilityEndless rumors abound about Putin’s deteriorating physical and mental condition – anything from thyroid to pancreatic cancer, to Parkinson’s, a mysterious mental illness caused by COVID-related isolation, and more. It is impossible, even for U.S. intelligence, to assess Putin’s health with high accuracy. Putin takes extreme measures – including having his security personnel collect his excrement and urine when he travels - to safeguard information about his health. There is no credible evidence Putin has a chronic condition like cancer. Instead, Putin appears ""entirely too healthy,"" as CIA Director William Burns recently assessed.

Putin was lucid, forceful, confident and looked healthy. There is no credible evidence suggesting the imminent collapse of Putin’s regime, his ouster or forced retirement into a sanatorium.What the future holdsPutin is preparing for the long haul and even an all-out war, anticipating NATO intervention. Moscow has mobilized additional 318,000 men and mandated basic military training in high school. It has expanded military cooperation with Iran and North Korea to replenish its depleting weapons supply. Russia is standing up bomb shelters, training police in wartime protocols and conducting emergency evacuation drills.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP 
 Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine is now into its ninth month with no end in sight
 (Contributor/Getty Images)The Biden administration’s solution to the Russia-Ukraine problem has been to hit Russia with more sanctions, deprive another Russian oligarch of his yacht or palace and send billions in aid to Ukraine. This is naïve and simplistic. The question of control over the post-Soviet space has been festering since the collapse of the USSR in 1991, and the balance of power in Eurasia has been contested for centuries. So victory is not around the corner, nor will it be defined by President Biden. That the Washington establishment is dragging America into yet another geopolitical experiment as Ukrainians are being slaughtered and their country ruined is irresponsible and dangerous. We are dealing with a nuclear power that is predisposed for the worst-case scenario thinking, and it will invoke the worst case before it accepts defeat in Ukraine.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM REBEKAH KOFFLER Rebekah Koffler is the president of Doctrine & Strategy Consulting, a former DIA intelligence officer, and the author of  ""Putin’s Playbook: Russia’s Secret Plan to Defeat America.""

 Emma Thompson said she was blindsided by ex-husband Kenneth Branagh's affair with Helena Bonham Carter.
 (Gareth Cattermole/Getty Images for BFI)She continued, ""What I learned was how easy it is to be blinded by your own desire to deceive yourself.""EMMA THOMPSON IS OVER DOING ‘UNBALANCED’ SEX SCENES IN MOVIESThe ""Cruella"" star told the outlet that her emotional state was like that of shattered dishes. ""I was half alive,"" she explained. ""Any sense of being a lovable or worthy person had gone completely."" In addition to being married, the former couple worked together on film projects, with Branagh casting Thompson in movies that he was directing. They starred in several movies together including ""Henry V"" (1989), ""Dead Again"" (1991), ""Peter's Friends"" (1992)  and ""Much Ado About Nothing"" (1993). 
 Branagh and Thompson were married from 1989 to 1995.
 (Ron Galella/Ron Galella Collection via Getty Images)Branagh's affair with Bonham Carter began in 1994 when he was directing and starring opposite the ""Dark Shadows"" actress in ""Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein.""By 1995, Branagh and Thompson's marriage was falling apart, but they had not yet announced their plans to separate. At the time, Thompson was filming the period piece ""Sense and Sensibility,"" based on Jane Austen's 1811 novel of the same name. She told the New Yorker that it was her ""Sense and Sensibility"" co-star Greg Wise ""who picked up the pieces and put them back together."" 
 Bonham Carter and Branagh dated for five years before splitting in 1999.
 (Ron Galella/Ron Galella Collection via Getty Images)Thompson and Wise have now been together for 27 years and married for 19 years. ""I’ve learned more from my second marriage just by being married,"" she said. ""As my mother says, ‘the first 20 years are the hardest.’ ""The two are parents to daughter Gaia, 22, and son, Tindyebwa, 34. In 1993, Thompson met Tindyebwa, a Rwandan refugee and former child soldier.

She added that the affair was ""all blood under the bridge.""""You can't hold on to anything like that,"" she told the outlet. ""It's pointless. I haven't got the energy for it. Helena and I made our peace years and years ago.""She also joked about why Branagh may have been attracted to both her and Bonham Carter. ""Being slightly mad and a bit fashion-challenged.

 By
 Erica Renee Davis | | This article was produced in partnership with FOX Bet | Facebook Twitter Flipboard Comments Print Email 
 FOX Bet Super 6 is a free-to-play contest where you pick the winners of all six marquee games with their margins of victory for a chance to win $100,000 in the NFL Sunday Challenge. Last week's big news was that we blinked and realized we were halfway through the NFL season. Time flies when you're having football.This week's big news? Well, there's a huge Week 10 clash between the Cowboys and Packers in America's Game of the Week on FOX. All eyes will be on these iconic franchises when they take the field Sunday afternoon. We'd expect nothing less from a matchup featuring a quarterback on the mend in Dak and a quarterback at his wit's end in Rodgers.While we're thrilled about tuning into that game, there are five other games that everyone needs to watch for a chance at Terry Bradshaw's $100,000. You read that right, Terry is giving away 100 grand in Week 10 of the NFL season in the FOX Bet Super 6 NFL Sunday Challenge. FOX Bet Super 6 is a free-to-play contest where you pick the winners of all six marquee games with their margins of victory for a chance to win $100,000 in our NFL Sunday Challenge. Just download the FOX Bet Super 6 app on your phone or mobile device, make your picks and submit your selections before Sunday’s games kick off. You could be prying $100,000 out of Terry's hands if you win.And since you don't have to work Friday in honor of Veterans Day, if you win 100 grand on Sunday, you can call off Monday, too. How's that for an extra long weekend?The only way to win Terry's money is to play. Download the FOX Bet Super 6 app on your mobile device right now and get ready to play NFL Sunday Challenge. It's easy, fun, and, most importantly, it's free!And if you need help before you make your picks, read our predictions below.Let's play!Lions at Bears (1 p.m. ET Sunday, FOX)The Lions finally got that elusive second win and against the Packers, no less. However, the Bears didn't look too shabby in Week 9 either. Chicago quarterback Justin Fields had himself a game, rushing for 178 yards — a regular-season record for a QB. Despite Justin's heroics, the Bears didn't upset Miami. Which squad gets the win in Week 10?Based on the odds at FOX Bet, 3-point favorite Chicago is due for a W. That sounds Bear-y good to us.Chicago's run game will help them get past the Lions. As noted above, Fields is a huge part of that. But it's not all ""See Justin Run;"" it's a total team effort. In Week 9, the Bears became the only team other than the 1976 Steelers to post 225 rushing yards or more in four straight games since the beginning of the Super Bowl era.It's also worth noting that since 2018 when the Bears are home favorites, they are 14-4 straight up (SU).Remember, though, that the Lions are 4-4 against the spread (ATS) this year. This means they've kept contests close even when the odds were against them. But their overall record is just 2-6. That's why we're backing the Bears in a tight one.Prediction:Bears by 1 to 2 pointsJaguars at Chiefs (1 p.m. ET Sunday, CBS)Patrick Mahomes in action is pure poetry. He has passed for 2,605 yards and 21 touchdowns, and both rank first in the league. His chemistry with top target tight end Travis Kelce on the field makes you wonder if they're besties off the field. And according to Instagram, yes.The tough Tennessee Titans gave the Chiefs all they could handle during Monday Night Football, so it took overtime for KC to get the 20-17 win. The Chiefs should anticipate an easier road against the Jags this week.Since 1997, the Jaguars are 6-7 ATS and 6-7 SU against Kansas City. Since 2013, they are 5-15 ATS and 4-16 when facing AFC West opponents.On KC's side, Patrick Mahomes is 27-6 SU as a starter when he's a home favorite in his career. And the squad has won five straight games against the Jaguars since 2010. Lastly, in November, the Chiefs are kings, going 10-0 in their last 10 matchups in the month.Kansas City, baby!Prediction: Chiefs by 11 to 13 pointsVikings at Bills (1 p.m. ET Sunday, FOX)If you're a long-time listener, you already know we back Kirk Cousins and his Vikings faster than you can say Twin City. And this weekend, with the health status of Bills QB Josh Allen in question, we're backing the Vikes again.The Vikings' 24.1 points per game is eighth-best in the NFL. Kirk Cousins is just one passing yard shy of 2,000 through the air this season, and his 13 touchdowns are tied for ninth. Wide receiver Justin Jefferson's 115 yards in Week 9 marked his 19th game racking up 100 yards or more.When we look at the Bills, if it weren't for Allen's questionable status, we would have given them a more serious look. They've gone 13-3 in their last 16 non-conference games, and they lead the league in total offense and scoring defense.But if Allen doesn't suit up, Case Keenum will get the call. Keenum, by the way, is 29-35 over his career as a starting quarterback.Prediction:Vikings by 6 pointsBrowns at Dolphins (1 p.m. ET Sunday, CBS)There's so much to love about this game because it features two of the league's most dynamic offensive players — Nick Chubb and Tyreek Hill.Cleveland's Chubb leads the NFL with 10 rushing touchdowns. Miami's Hill leads the league in both receiving yards and touchdowns. Electric is what comes to mind when we think about these two offensive forces. When it comes to the odds, FOX Bet gives the Dolphins a 3.5-point edge. But we're backing the Browns.Here's why.Cleveland's Myles Garrett is a sack machine. He has racked up 7.5 sacks this year, so Cleveland gets the edge defensively. And the Browns are coming off a bye. Never underestimate the power of a team coming off a rest week.What can brown do for you? They can cover and beat the Dolphins in Miami.Prediction:Browns by 4 to 5 pointsSaints at Steelers (1 p.m. ET Sunday, FOX)This is a battle between two bad teams. The 3-6 Saints are coming off a 27-13 Monday Night Football loss to the Ravens. The uncharacteristically awful Steelers at 2-6 are coming off a two-game losing streak. And even though the Black & Gold have one less win than N.O., we like Pittsburgh in the matchup.The Saints have the worst turnover differential in the NFL, and their 28th-ranked scoring defense is also near the bottom.To be fair, Pittsburgh is also having a miserable year. But the Steelers are 12-7 SU as a home underdog under Mike Tomlin, and they're 11-4 SU under Tomlin following a bye.We'll say it again — never underestimate a team's ability to come back stronger after a bye week, especially when you're talking about the Pittsburgh Steelers.Prediction:Steelers by 3 pointsCowboys at Packers (4:25 p.m. ET Sunday, FOX)This is a big one. America's Game of the Week. Both these iconic franchises will be on their A-games.However, the result will be the Cowboys by three touchdowns. OK, we're only partially kidding.Have you seen how bad the Packers have looked all season? Even Skip Bayless' BFF Lil Wayne took to Twitter to express his disdain for Aaron ""Everyone Else's Fault"" Rodgers. Dallas has been on a roll. The Cowboys are 6-2, they lead the NFL with 33 sacks, and they're 7-2 in their last nine games after a bye. And it hasn't mattered if it's Cooper Rush or two-time Pro Bowler Dak Prescott starting. Doesn't matter if it's Zeke eating or Tony Pollard carrying the rock. The Cowboys are on fire.On the other hand, the Packers probably want to set fire to their season.Green Bay is 3-6, and the team is on a five-game losing streak. FIVE! We don't mean to sound dramatic here, but this is a big deal. It's the first time the Pack has been on a five-game losing streak since 2008.America's Game of the Week will be the biggest stage in the league this weekend. And Dallas has the edge in this game on offense, defense and on the strength of the momentum they're riding right into this contest. Prediction:Cowboys by 11 to 13 pointsNow, it's your turn to jump in and win some money!After you download the app and submit your selections for the upcoming contest, be sure to share your picks with us by tagging @FOXSuper6 and @EricaReneeD and use the #EricaSuper6 hashtag across all social media platforms.Let's win big in Week 10!

 Facebook Twitter Instagram RSS Email OPINION Published November 13, 2022 7:00am EST Biden and Xi's high stakes meeting – 3 tasks the president must deliver on in Bali President Xi Jinping is looking for a victory lap. President Biden needs to remind the G20 members that the US is still the world's only superpower 
 By
 Rebecca Grant | Fox News Facebook Twitter Flipboard Comments Print Email close Video China deterrence 'our most urgent national security challenge': Rep. Mike Gallagher Rep. Mike Gallagher, R-Wis., says he hopes Biden will press Chinese President Xi Jinping publicly about his willingness to start a war in Asia and urges the U.S. to project ‘strength’ not ‘weakness.’NEWYou can now listen to Fox News articles!
 America is engaged in a monumental struggle global struggle with China. While the White House is already downplaying expectations for the sideline meeting between President Joe Biden and China’s Xi Jinping, the fact is this struggle is at a pivotal phase.The Bali meeting between Biden and Xi on the sidelines of the G20 will be short.  Expect Biden to do most of the talking; previous Zoom calls have lasted up to three hours, when Biden got in lecture mode.  It’s a G20 meeting, so get ready for gooey talk about energy transitions and global economic recovery. But don’t expect any major trade concessions or diplomatic ""deliverables,"" says the White House. They know Xi is not there to negotiate. China’s penetration of American universities, cyber theft of technology, and takeover of the United Nations is humming along, so China’s incentive to talk is minimal right now.  VideoXi Jinping wants to show up in Bali, Indonesia and take a victory lap after cementing his total political control of China last month. The G20 and guests are his best customers, after all. BIDEN, CHINA'S XI TO HOLD FIRST IN-PERSON MEETING MONDAY IN INDONESIAHowever, the G20 (minus Russia) is also pretty much the core of the international system. These are the countries China wants to dominate, as Xi tries to push the U.S. out of the world leadership role.  The attendees also include America’s best allies and friends. 
 FILE PHOTO: Chinese President Xi Jinping shakes hands with U.S. Vice President Joe Biden (L) inside the Great Hall of the People in Beijing December 4, 2013. 
 (REUTERS/Lintao Zhang/Pool//File Photo)In Indonesia, the big task for Biden is to remind the G20 nations that despite Xi Jinping’s ruthless ambitions, the U.S. is still the sole superpower in the world today. Specifically, Biden should take Xi to task for his support of Russia’s war in Ukraine, the massive nuclear build-up, and of course the threats against Taiwan. PUTIN TO SKIP INDONESIA G20 SUMMIT DUE TO ASSASSINATION FEAR: REPORTTo start, Biden can and should rally the many supporters of Ukraine and call out Xi Jinping’s for backing Russia’s war. He will never admit it but watching the success of Ukraine against Russia has startled Xi. China’s military has impressive equipment but basically zero combat experience.  Using American weapons and tactics, Ukraine is pulverizing Russia’s big military.  VideoChina picked a loser by backing Putin and Xi has got to be having doubts about all those Russian weapons in China’s arsenal, and exactly what bad tactics Chinese troops learned from joint drills with Russia.  Biden gains a lot from the reflected glow of Ukraine’s success.WHITE HOUSE DODGES ON WHETHER BIDEN WILL BRING UP COVID-19 ORIGINS IN XI JINPING MEETINGAnd he’ll need it for the second task: delivering a message on nuclear deterrence. Xi has China on course to build hundreds of new nuclear weapons. New missile fields, the orbiting nuclear weapons, more road-mobile missiles with multiple warheads: China is racing to overtake the U.S. arsenal. TAIWAN SCRAMBLES JETS, MISSILE SYSTEMS AFTER DETECTING 11 CHINESE AIRCRAFT, VESSELS NEAR ISLANDChina refuses to discuss arms control and appears to view the nuclear triad as a tool of coercion, not stability.   
 FILE – Chinese President Xi Jinping attends a commendation ceremony for role models of the Beijing Winter Olympics and Paralympics at the Great Hall of the People on April 8 in Beijing. 
 (AP Photo/Ng Han Guan)In the decade ahead, the U.S. will be hard-pressed to buy enough new B-21 bombers, nuclear missiles and Columbia-class submarines to deter China.  Biden needs to drop the Obama-era no nukes verbiage and tell Xi the U.S. will deter China’s nuclear ambitions. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTERFinally, Biden must stand up for Taiwan. ""I’m going to have that conversation with him,"" Biden declared Nov. 9.  We’ll see. Vague red lines won’t help. Biden must make clear to Xi that America will arm and protect Taiwan. Biden has come out with sharp messages implying the United States will help defend Taiwan if China invades. Sure, the White House walks it back, but the law gives Biden wide latitude to order U.S. military action.  VideoThe White House can’t let State Department eagerness to restore dialogue derail deterrence. Every strong word from Biden is effective. China’s already angry because the White House plans to debrief Taiwan on the results of the Biden-Xi meeting. I like that. As Taiwan policy shows, Biden can actually get a lot of help from the rising generation of House and Senate Republicans, who rightly see China as a threat like no other. ""I’m very, very concerned.  China is watching this weak commander in chief Joe Biden,"" Rep. Elise Stefanik, R- N.Y., said Oct. 4. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPHouse Republicans like Stefanik will investigate medical research dollars to China, bump up defense investment in Taiwan, and keep restoring U.S. military strength. It’s going to take both parties to face down China.Xi Jinping is bent on world domination, but Biden and the likely new GOP House still have opportunities to set limits on how far Xi can go. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM DR.

 Ryan Gaydos | Fox News Facebook Twitter Flipboard Comments Print Email close Video Dallas Cowboys and Green Bay Packers prepare for showdown in NFL week 10 FOX Sports lead NFL analyst Greg Olsen previews the Dallas Cowboys-Green Bay Packers matchup and weighs in on whether the Cowboys will try to sign free agent Odell Beckham Jr.NFL Week 10 will be an important one with matchups that will have playoff implications and plenty of storylines. The Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Seattle Seahawks, San Francisco 49ers and San Diego Chargers need wins to keep pace in the playoff chase or to separate themselves from challengers.The Jacksonville Jaguars, who have a date with the Kansas City Chiefs, have appeared to be outperforming expectations with a plus-21 point differential, but they have only three wins to show for it. The Chiefs have been rolling but cannot fall into a trap game against a tough AFC South opponent. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COMThe Buffalo Bills and Minnesota Vikings will have tough tests against one another. But things could change based on the playing status of Josh Allen. The Dallas Cowboys return from a bye to face off against the Green Bay Packers in what will be Mike McCarthy’s first game against his ex-team.Sunday wraps with the San Francisco 49ers hosting the Los Angeles Chargers.--Buccaneers (4-5) vs. Seahawks (6-3) – 9:30 a.m. ET, NFL Network 
 Seattle Seahawks quarterback Geno Smith wears an FC Bayern Munich scarf as he answers questions during a news conference after a practice session in Munich, Germany, Thursday, Nov. 10, 2022.
 (AP Photo/Matthias Schrader)The Buccaneers and Seahawks will have a historic matchup in Munich, Germany. It will be the first regular season game in the country at Allianz Arena, the home of Bundesliga’s FC Bayern Munich.Tom Brady will look to somehow stymie the hot Seahawks squad led by Geno Smith. Brady enters the international matchup 3-0 abroad but has a lot of work to do to get past Seattle. The Bucs got a bit of divisional cushion, courtesy of the Atlanta Falcons’ loss to the Carolina Panthers Thursday night.The Seahawks enter the game with one of the top offenses in the NFL. The team is fourth in points scored and 11th in yards gained. Smith is leading the NFL with seven games of two or more touchdown passes and will look for his fourth straight game with at least two touchdown passes and a passer rating of 100 or more.Bills (6-2) vs. Vikings (7-1) – 1 p.m. ET, FOX 
 Minnesota Vikings quarterback Kirk Cousins (8) throws during the first half of a game against the Washington Commanders, Sunday, Nov. 6, 2022, in Landover, Md. 
 (AP Photo/Julio Cortez)The Minnesota Vikings came back to beat the Washington Commanders in Week 9 while the Buffalo Bills fell to the New York Jets and Josh Allen got hurt. Allen didn’t practice for three days this week, which may be a sign he won’t start against a tough Vikings team. In that case, Case Keenum would start.The game features two of the best wide receivers in football in Justin Jefferson and Stefon Diggs of the Buffalo Bills. Since 2020, when Jefferson entered the league, Jefferson is first in receiving yards with 3,883 and fifth in receptions with 255 while Diggs is second in receptions with 290 and fourth in receiving yards with 3,617.Both teams are among the top contenders in their conferences and a win help either team reinforce that status.NFL POWER RANKINGS: EAGLES MAINTAIN UNDEFEATED RECORD, SEAHAWKS INCH CLOSER TO THE TOPChiefs (6-2) vs. Jaguars (3-6) – 1 p.m. ET, CBS 
 Jacksonville Jaguars quarterback Trevor Lawrence passes against the Las Vegas Raiders in the first half of a game Sunday, Nov. 6, 2022, in Jacksonville, Fla. 
 (AP Photo/John Raoux)The Chiefs are looking to build momentum after a big win in primetime against the Tennessee Titans last week. Patrick Mahomes changed the game in Kansas City’s direction with his running, and the team did enough to force overtime and get the victory. After putting up 400 yards last game, Mahomes is looking to join Dak Prescott and Ryan Fitzpatrick as the only quarterbacks with three straight games of 400 yards passing.But even with the firepower of Mahomes, Travis Kelce and Chris Jones on the defensive line, the team faces a bit of a trap game against the Jaguars, who are looking for a signature 2022 win.Jacksonville is 3-6 but may be the best 3-6 team in the NFL. The team has a plus-21 point differential and is 18th in points scored and eighth in yards gained. The team is 11th in points allowed and 16th in yards allowed. From Week 4 to Week 8, Jacksonville lost four games by fewer than 10 points. The team also lost by only six points to the Washington Commanders in Week 1.It wouldn’t be a surprise if this game is closer than what most fans expect.Packers (3-6) vs. Cowboys (6-2) – 4:25 p.m. ET, FOX 
 Green Bay Packers head coach Mike McCarthy talks to quarterback Aaron Rodgers (12) during the first half of the NFC Championship game against the Seattle Seahawks in Seattle Jan. 18, 2015. 
 (AP Photo/David J. Phillip, File)Dallas Cowboys coach Mike McCarthy choked up this week when he was asked about playing the Green Bay Packers at Lambeau Field for the first time since he took over the job.""It’s here. Just like anything, you have to get ready to go win,"" McCarthy said, via Yahoo Sports. ""Obviously, I have great memories about Green Bay, and I spent a lot of time there. But I’m four years removed from working there. ... I really want to win the game. Is that enough?""The Cowboys have a great defense and will give McCarthy an edge over Matt LaFleur and Aaron Rodgers on Sunday considering the Packers’ offense has failed to do much of anything this season. Micah Parsons, Trevon Diggs and Demarcus Lawrence will be looking to have a field day.Rodgers said he hoped McCarthy would receive more cheers than jeers when he returned.""Really positive, I think,"" Rodgers said, via The Athletic. ""I hope that the fans show a lot of gratitude and appreciation for his 13 seasons and a championship and a lot of great memories over the years. He’s got a street named for him. That’s pretty special. But I hope that the fans give him the reception he deserves.""Rodgers has been trying to spin the Packers in a positive direction over the last week. But with his own young wide receivers reportedly disgruntled over the way the season’s gone, it might be the start of a very tough next couple of weeks for the quarterback great.49ers (4-4) vs. Chargers (5-3) – 8:20 p.m. ET. NBC 
 Los Angeles Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert warms up before a game against the Atlanta Falcons, Sunday, Nov. 6, 2022, in Atlanta. 
 (AP Photo/Butch Dill)A West Coast battle will end Sunday’s slate of games.The 49ers are coming off a bye, and that could only be helpful in their race to keep up with the Seahawks. Christian McCaffrey will have an increased knowledge of the offense, which will only have a negative effect for opposing defenses. In Week 8, McCaffrey became the fourth player since 1970 with a passing touchdown, rushing touchdown and a reception touchdown.The Chargers will have to do better than just 20 points like they had in last week’s win over the Atlanta Falcons. Justin Herbert will need to play up to his standards against one of the toughest teams in the NFL.This should be a good dessert for NFL fans.--CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPHere’s the rest of Sunday1 pm ET: Bears (3-6) vs. Lions (2-6)1 pm ET: Dolphins (6-3) vs. Browns (3-5)1 pm ET: Giants (6-2) vs. Texans (1-6-1)1 pm ET: Steelers (2-6) vs. Saints (3-6)4:05 pm ET: Raiders (2-6) vs. Colts (3-5-1)4:25 pm ET: Rams (3-5) vs. Cardinals (3-6) Ryan Gaydos is the sports editor for Fox News Digital.

 By
 Audrey Conklin | Fox News Facebook Twitter Flipboard Comments Print Email close Video Cutting edge DNA technology could help solve JonBenet Ramsey’s haunting murder case Fox News host Laura Ingle delivers an exclusive interview with JonBenet Ramsey’s father, John Ramsey, who hopes the recent advances in DNA technology will help find his daughter’s killer.JonBenet Ramsey's father John has some hope that his deceased six-year-old daughter's 1996 murder case could take a turn after the Boulder Police Department on Wednesday announced a new path to finding her killer — but he doesn't think it will be enough.BPD said it will consult the Colorado Cold Case Review Team in sometime in 2023 — 26 years after Ramsey found his daughter murdered in the basement of their family home on Dec. 26, 1996.John Ramsey, 78, said the police department's decision to partner with the state cold case team was ""the only encouraging thing"" he had read in BPD's statement.""Sadly, it sounded like more of the same…"" Ramsey told Fox News Digital, ""and that's not what we need. It's a good effort by their PR department, but that's not what we need to be done.""JONBENET RAMSEY CASE: BOULDER POLICE CONSULTING COLD CASE REVIEW TEAM NEARLY 26 YEARS AFTER 6-YEAR-OLD'S DEATH 
 JonBenet Ramsey was murdered in her family's Boulder, Colorado, home on Dec. 26, 1996.
 (Ramsey family handout)JonBenet's mother reported the six-year-old missing to police on the morning of Dec. 26, 1996, after finding a lengthy ransom note demanding $118,000 in exchange for JonBenet. John Ramsey found her body later that same day. Her killer has yet to be identified.Ramsey does think that his recent efforts to shed new light in the case in recent years may have helped inspire BPD's decision to consult the cold case team, but he's waiting for something more, and is willing to pursue potential legal action if significant developments in the case are not made soon.JONBENET RAMSEY CASE: FATHER REMEMBERS ‘DADDY’S GIRL' ON WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN HER 32ND BIRTHDAY""They would love for this case just to go away and put in a file cabinet that never gets opened. We're not gonna let that happen,"" Ramsey said. 
 JonBenet's mother reported the six-year-old missing to police on the morning of Dec. 26, 1996, before her father, John Ramsey, found her dead later that day in their basement.
 (John Ramsey)BPD says it has investigated leads from more than 21,000 tips, letters and emails and traveled to 19 states to speak with more than 1,000 people about the case.""This crime has left a hole in the hearts of many, and we will never stop investigating until we find JonBenet’s killer,"" Boulder Police Chief Maris Herold said in a Wednesday statement. ""That includes following up on every lead and working with our policing partners and DNA experts around the country to solve this tragic case. This investigation has always been and will continue to be a priority for the Boulder Police Department.""JONBENET RAMSEY COLD CASE: DNA EXPERT EXPLAINS HOW MYSTERY MIGHT BE SOLVED IN SHORT ORDERIn the spring of 2022, Ramsey helped release a petition that has since garnered more than 28,000 signatures calling on Colorado Gov. Jared Polis to allow an independent agency to take over the investigation from BPD. 
 JonBenet Ramsey would have turned 32 on Saturday, Aug. 6, 2022.
 (Ramsey family)The father of five has expressed discontent with BPD's handling of the case over the past 26 years and believes that independent research teams who have offered their assistance in the case can bring his daughter's killer to light. To do so, the city of Boulder and BPD must hand over the case evidence in their custody so items can be re-tested for DNA to potentially build a profile of the suspect(s).If they are able to build a more complete DNA profile of the suspect(s), that information can then be compared to millions of DNA profiles uploaded to public databases showing people’s unique genetic codes.JONBENET RAMSEY CASE: FATHER TO PURSUE LEGAL ACTION IF COLORADO IGNORES REQUEST FOR INDEPENDENT DNA TESTING""There are … two or three cutting-edge labs that have had great success,"" Ramsey explained. ""And they're they're private. They're not within the government. The government, by their own admission, the FBI told us this six or eight months ago: 'We don't have the latest technology that is only available in these outside labs,' and that's where we need to go. So, we want that to be done."" 
 Boulder police on Wednesday announced that they would be collaborating with the Colorado Cold Case Review Team in 2023 in its search for answers in the 1996 JonBenet Ramsey murder case.
 (Discovery+)Ramsey said he had sent his own DNA sample to Ancestry DNA, which sells DNA test kits for $25, so that his genetic code is available in its database. The company says on its website that it has ""surpassed 4 million customers in our DNA database"" and is ""proud to remain the largest consumer genetic testing company.""The 78-year-old father and grandfather said the process of trying to get answers over the past two and a half decades can get tiresome, but he is still motivated to keep going.JONBENET RAMSEY MURDER: FAMILY ‘ENCOURAGED’ BY RENEWED INTEREST IN CASE, DNA TESTING POSSIBILITIES""It gets weary to keep beating the same drum,"" he said.CrimeCon 2022 — a convention for true-crime enthusiasts, scientists, journalists and victims of crime alike to come together and discuss their similar or different experiences — re-energized Ramsey. He spoke at the convention to a room of several hundred people who remained silent as he told his side of the story after 25 years. 
 JonBenet Ramsey was mysteriously murdered in her family's Boulder, Colorado, home in December 1996.
 (Ramsey family collection/ Discovery+)CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP""I was just overwhelmed by the interest and supportive people that were behind us and that we can leverage,"" he said.On the one hand, Ramsey is hopeful that BPD seems willing to get help from the state cold case team to find new leads in his daughter's murder case. On the other hand, he said he doesn't know anything about the cold case team or who works for it, so he is unsure whether the 2023 partnership will reveal anything promising. Ramsey is also waiting to hear back from the Colorado governor to discuss next steps. Audrey Conklin is a digital reporter for Fox News Digital and FOX Business.

Applegate explained that she hasn't watched the final season and doesn't think she will because it would ""too hard"" for her. However, she was determined to finish the show despite how difficult it was for her.""I couldn’t have done it without this need to tell our story,"" she said.

But I was like, ""No, no, no, no, no, no: We have to finish this story."" She continued ""It’s too important to our hearts; too important to our souls.

""It takes time to kind of figure out this disease, and figure out what’s bringing on symptoms. I’m just a newbie to all of this. So I’m trying to figure it out — and I’m also in mourning for the person that I was.""""I have to find a place that’s as loving as my set was, where they won’t think I’m a diva by saying, 'Hey, I can only work five hours.'""She told Variety that she has ruled out ever taking on another lead role again given how challenging it was to complete filming on ""Dead to Me.""""I’m pretty convinced that this was it, you know? But who knows — I’m probably gonna get real bored of being in my room,"" Applegate said.Though she may leave acting behind her, the Los Angeles native said that she is interested in pursuing other work in entertainment business. 
 Applegate is set to receive a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on Nov. 14.
 (Adriana M. Barraza / WENN)""I’d like to develop stuff, I’d like to produce stuff,"" she said. ""I’ve got a lot of ideas in my mind, and I just need to get them executed.""Earlier this month, Applegate told the New York Times that she had gained 40 pounds since her diagnosis and could no longer walk without using a cane.CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER""This is the first time anyone's going to see me the way I am. I put on 40 pounds; I can't walk without a cane.

I’m sure that people are going to be, like, ‘I can’t get past it.’""Applegate is set to receive a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on Nov. 14. The ceremony, which was originally set to take place in 2020, will be her first public appearance since being diagnosed with MS. In 2019, she announced on Twitter that she was receiving the honor, which she said was ""a childhood dream.""""Now my life is a different story,"" she told Variety. ""People are going to see me for the first time as a disabled person, and it’s very difficult.

 Facebook Twitter Instagram RSS Email Veterans Published November 12, 2022 5:32pm EST Actor Gary Sinise and quadruple amputee veteran Travis Mills team up to help other wounded service members Gary Sinise met Travis Mills at Walter Reed when he was recovering from an IED blast in Afghanistan 
 By
 Paul Best | Fox News Facebook Twitter Flipboard Comments Print Email close Video Actor Gary Sinise and veteran Travis Mills discuss donation for wellness retreat that caters to wounded service members The Gary Sinise Foundation is donating $1.5 million to an organization run by retired U.S. Army Staff Sgt. Travis Mills. The funds will be used for a wellness retreat in Maine where wounded veterans can go to participate in adaptive activities.U.S. Army Staff Sergeant Travis Mills was supposed to have the day off on April 10, 2012, about six weeks into his third deployment in Afghanistan. But late that afternoon, a civilian informant tipped them off about improvised explosive devices (IEDs) near Maiwand, a village roughly 40 miles west of Kandahar, Afghanistan's second-largest city. Mills set out with his team around 4:30 p.m. to sweep the area. If they located an IED, they'd mark it and have an Explosive Ordnance Disposal team come later to get rid of it. Just 400 yards away, as a minesweeper on his team scanned the ground, Mills dropped his backpack on an IED, igniting an explosion that would rip off both of his legs above the knee, his right arm below the shoulder, and his left arm below the elbow.  
 U.S. Army Staff Sergeant Travis Mills during one of his three deployments to Afghanistan. 
 (Travis Mills Foundation)Mills survived the blast, becoming one of five quadruple amputees from the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. After undergoing emergency medical care halfway across the world, Mills was flown back to the United States to start the healing process at Walter Reed Military Medical Center. ""I was visited in the hospital by a lot of awesome people, but I happened to have Gary Sinise come in and meet me and say, 'Hey, you know, I'm Gary Sinise.' And I'm like, ‘No, I know exactly who you are, sir,’"" Mills told Fox News Digital. VETERANS DAY AND ITS HISTORY: 6 KEY FACTS TO KNOWThat meeting in 2012 with Gary Sinise – an actor best known for his portrayal in ""Forrest Gump"" of Lt. Dan, a soldier who loses both legs in Vietnam and initially resents Gump for saving him but later learns to live a full life with his injuries – sparked a decade long friendship and partnership. ""He's an inspirational, wonderful guy,"" Sinise told Fox News Digital. ""I love him to pieces, and he's done amazing things with his challenging situation. He's just taken that and spun it on its head.""  
 Travis Mills meeting Gary Sinise for the first time in May 2012 after returning home to recover at Walter Reed Military Medical Center. 
 (Gary Sinise Foundation)This month, the Gary Sinise Foundation is donating $1.5 million to the Travis Mills Foundation, funds that will go toward bringing veterans and their families to a new health and wellness center recently opened by Mills in Rome, Maine. The center caters to ""recalibrated veterans,"" a term coined by Mills to refer to former soldiers who are learning to live a full life despite their physical injuries. ON VETERANS DAY, THIS VIETNAM VET WANTS OTHERS TO KNOW: ‘YOU ARE NOT ALONE’Mills gives a lot of the credit to Sinise, who built him a smart home through his foundation's RISE (Restoring Independence Supporting Empowerment) program in 2014. ""I just thought, the Gary Sinise foundation is building these amazing homes for these service members that deserve it and need it. It's not just that they deserve it because they're injured, but they actually need it to live independently,"" Mills said.  
 The Gary Sinise Foundation built a smart home for Travis Mills in 2014 in Maine. 
 (Gary Sinise Foundation)""And I thought, I could do something and bring those service members back together, and show them to not live life on the sidelines and to be active in their society and active with their family.""WREATHS ACROSS AMERICA HONORS FALLEN MILITARY AT HOLIDAY TIME: ‘DEEP APPRECIATION FOR THOSE WHO SERVE’Mills first started the retreats at their Maine home in 2017 and will continue bringing dozens of wounded veterans and their families out to the new wellness center, where they can learn adaptive activities like kayaking, fishing, and archery. ""We try to give them not only the best week they've had all year at our facility, we also want them to take these skills home with them and continue on,"" Mills said.  
 Travis Mills has dozens of veterans and their families out to a new wellness center where they can learn activities they never thought were possible after their injuries.
 (Travis Mills Foundation)Mills is able to help these veterans learn to adapt with a team of physical therapists, but also through his own experience going from a college football player to a quadruple amputee. ""I went from that to having no arms, no legs and then having two children now that I can't play catch in the backyard, can't play soccer with, but I can go kayaking, I can go fishing, I can go snowboarding, believe it or not,"" Mills said. ""Life is truly all about perspective. For me, I was fortunate to make it through my injuries… This is just me. It's my new normal. And I realize the price I could have paid, and I think having perspective has gotten me where I am today, because some really great friends of mine didn't make it home, didn't make it home to their daughters, their sons, their spouses, and their loved ones."" 
 Travis Mills and his family with Gary Sinise during a visit. 
 (Gary Sinise Foundation)For Sinise, his dedication to service members goes back decades, initially supporting veterans groups in the Chicago area in the 1980s after the Vietnam War. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPDepicting Lt. Dan in ""Forrest Gump"" magnified his relationship with service members in the 1990s, and the 9/11 attacks prompted him to form the ""Lt. Dan Band"" in 2003, which he toured military bases with worldwide as Americans were sent overseas. ""So many of the people like [Travis] that I've met, they've just motivated me to keep coming back and doing a little bit more,"" Sinise said. ""I feel like I'm just a conduit for many, many grateful Americans out there who want to do something supportive for the men and women who serve our country.""

Democrats need to win one more Senate race to keep its current majority, and the GOP needs to flip two seats to get to 51 seats 
 By
 Thomas Phippen | Fox News Facebook Twitter Flipboard Comments Print Email close Video Laxalt's lead against Sen. Cortez Masto narrows as vote counting continues Fox News chief correspondent Jonathan Hunt gives the latest details on the Nevada Senate race between Adam Laxalt and Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto on 'Special Report with Bret Baier.'Nevada's Senate race narrowed again after Friday's batch of reported ballots, shrinking GOP nominee Adam Laxalt's lead to less than a thousand votes with thousands of votes still to be counted.The stakes of the Nevada race could determine whether Republicans win back control of the Senate, since Democrats need to win one more seat to maintain their narrow 50-50 majority. With Democratic Sen. Mike Kelly winning re-election in Arizona, only two seats are left in play — Georgia and Nevada.The GOP needs to flip both Democrat-held seats in order to get a narrow 51-senator majority in the Senate. Georgia's is heading to a Dec. 6 runoff election between Sen. Raphael Warnock and Republican nominee Herschel Walker. Warnock received less than the required 50% of the vote in the Nov. 8 election, winning 49.42% of the vote to Walker's 48.52%. Libertarian candidate Chase Oliver won 2% of the vote.While there's no automatic recount law in Nevada, the losing candidate could demand a recount after all the votes are tallied. CATHERINE CORTEZ MASTO INCHES CLOSER TO OVERTAKING ADAM LAXALT

This has narrowed our victory window,"" he said,But it's unclear what precincts are still sending in ballots. Laxalt said the race will come down to ballots dropped off on Election Day in Clark County.""If they are GOP precincts or slightly DEM leaning then we can still win. If they continue to trend heavy DEM then she will overtake us. Thanks for all the prayers from millions of Nevadans and Americans who hope we can still take back the Senate and start taking our country back,"" Laxalt added.GET THE LATEST 2020 MIDTERM ELECTION RESULTS FROM FOX NEWSFox News Digital reached out to Cortez Masto's campaign to ask if the senator would request a recount in the event of a narrow loss, but did not receive a response.

In their time together in Minnesota, Diggs had 163 catches for 2,151 yards and 15 touchdowns. And then Diggs wanted out. He was eventually traded to the Buffalo Bills, giving the Vikings the 22nd pick of the 2020 NFL Draft. That pick became Justin Jefferson, who was fourth in the NFL in receiving yards in his rookie season and has 20 touchdown catches in his first 2 ½ years in the league.

Being able to get Justin made it sting a little less, if you will, with the way Justin’s played. But, make no mistake about it, Stefon is an elite receiver. He’s shown that here, he’s shown that there, and he’s doing it again this year.

 Ryan Morik | Fox News Facebook Twitter Flipboard Comments Print Email close Video Dallas Cowboys and Green Bay Packers prepare for showdown in NFL week 10 FOX Sports lead NFL analyst Greg Olsen previews the Dallas Cowboys and Green Bay Packers matchup and weighs in on whether the Cowboys will try to sign free agent Odell Beckham Jr.The NFL Players Association wrote a letter calling for the ""immediate replacement and ban"" of slit-film turf fields throughout the league.The league uses three types of turf: slit-firm, dual fiber, and monofilament, but it's the slit-firm surface that has proven players to miss more time due to injuries, which happen at an increased rate on it as well.""Advocating for safer working conditions is a core job of our union, and there are few greater examples of this than raising the standards of the fields we practice and play on,"" NFLPA President JC Tretter wrote on Saturday.

 (Al Pereira/Getty Images) ""Week after week, we have heard players sound off on the need to improve our fields, too often after a player suffers an injury. This week, we have seen the NFL PR machine go into overdrive to spin a more favorable narrative to what the union and players know is a problem.""If the NFL is serious about their claims that they make data-based decisions and that they care about player safety, then we have some actionable items for them.""Six stadiums (and seven teams) use slit-firm turf. Tretter wrote that the NFL has acknowledged that slit-film fields are more detrimental to players' health than other surfaces. However, Tretter says that ""the NFL has not only refused to mandate this change immediately, but they have also refused to commit to mandating a change away from slit film in the future at all.""""The injuries on slit film are completely avoidable -- both the NFL and NFLPA experts agree on the data -- and yet the NFL will not protect players from a subpar surface,"" Tretter said.Tretter also called for the raising of field standards and testing the safety and performance of all surfaces.

The current field inspections do not account for performance and safety, so we should stop saying that these fields are safe to play on based on the fact they passed said inspection,"" Tretter wrote, adding that the inspection standards are over 13 years old.The Kelce brothers, Travis and Jason, recently echoed the NFLPA's sentiments.""Take care of your players, man. It is so ridiculous, my feeling of my body after a game on turf than the feeling of my body after a game on grass,"" the Kansas City Chiefs tight end said on his podcast this week. ""I can only imagine if the game I just played against Tennessee was on turf. Like, I barely walked out of that thing and I know it's magnified by 10 whenever I play on turf. Every single step in the fourth quarter you feel in the knees and in the joints and in the ankles – at least this is just for me. I hate playing on turf. I think it's silly.""The tight end added that he keeps track of which games he plays on turf before the season even starts, so he can ""mentally prepare.""

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., with his latest column arguing that the political spectrum is trending away from populism on both sides of the aisle, including that of the liberal lawmaker.  Ocasio-Cortez laid into Brooks on Twitter after he offered a pejorative description of her progressive brainchild, the Green New Deal, suggesting that her brand of left-wing populism is on the outs, along with former President Donald Trump’s MAGA movement.She slammed him for knocking the legislation and for portraying her as a political figure comparable to Trump.

 However, Trump wasn’t the only one who represents ""performative populism"" in Brooks' assessment. AOC does as well. He wrote, ""The left had its own smaller version of performative populism. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez became a major political figure thanks to her important contributions to Instagram.""Dismissive of her legislative work, Brooks added, ""The Green New Deal was not a legislative package but a cotton candy media concoction.""He also slammed other far-left ideas embraced by her and other Democrats, writing, ""Slogans like ‘Abolish ICE’ and ‘Defund the police’ were not practical policies, just cool catchphrases to put on posters.""CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPThe New York congresswoman appeared insulted at this depiction of her politics.

She then balked at the notion that she’s as far left as Trump is far right, declaring, ""He wants me to be Trump, but I’m not."" Gabriel Hays is an associate editor for Fox News Digital.

 Facebook Twitter Instagram RSS Email Midterm Elections Published November 12, 2022 9:53pm EST Democrats to maintain control of the United States Senate The new Congress will officially be sworn into office in January 
 By
 Andrew Mark Miller , Kyle Morris | Fox News Facebook Twitter Flipboard Comments Print Email close Video GOP performance in midterms was a ‘let-down’: Sen. Shelley Moore Capito Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., weighs in on the conversation surrounding control of CongressDemocrats will have continued control of the Senate, the Fox News Decision Desk can project. Democrats will maintain power in the Senate thanks to Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto being declared the winner in Nevada on Saturday night in her race against Republican challenger Adam Laxalt. Democrats now hold 50 seats compared to the 49 seats held by Republicans with one seat yet to be decided in Georgia where a runoff election will be held between Republican Herschel Walker and Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock on December 6th.Even if Walker were to win in Georgia, Democrats would still have control with Vice President Kamala Harris's tie-breaking vote. MIDTERM ELECTIONS 2022: LIVE UPDATES 
 The U.S. Capitol Building is seen on September 27, 2022 in Washington, DC.
 (Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)""Voters across the country have delivered a resounding endorsement of Democrats’ Senate majority,"" Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee Chair Sen. Gary Peters said in a statement. ""These historic results in race after race speak for themselves, and they reflect the strength of our candidates, the popularity of Senate Democrats' message to the American people, and a rejection of the extremism espoused by the GOP.  Now our work continues in Georgia to ensure Herschel Walker is defeated and Rev. Warnock is re-elected.""Prior to Tuesday's nationwide midterm elections, Democrats held a razor-thin majority in the upper chamber of Congress with 50 seats in their party's control. Because Vice President Kamala Harris has the ability to cast tie-breaking votes, Democrats only needed 50 seats to keep control.Prior to 2021, the last time Democrats controlled the Senate was from January 2013 to January 2015 during the 113th Congress.In this year's midterm elections, Republicans were forced to defend 21 seats, while Democrats had to defend just 14. Three of the four closest Senate races this cycle featured a Democrat incumbent.Throughout their campaigns, Republican candidates focused their messaging around issues that they believed voters care most about, including rising crime, out of control inflation, and the southern border crisis.EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THE SENATE MIDTERMS, CANDIDATES, AND IMPORTANT RACES

The party also focused on voting rights and election deniers, with President Joe Biden declaring just before the elections that ""MAGA Republicans"" who promoted former President Trump’s ""Big Lie"" about the 2020 election and engaged in voter intimidation are a ""threat"" to democracy.The Senate consists of 100 lawmakers serving six-year terms; every election year about one-third of Senate seats are up for grabs.

 Gladys Hughes is honored in October 2022 in Nashville by The Charlie Daniels Journey Home Project. ""When someone says to me, ‘Thank you for your service,’ I want to shout out to them, ‘Thank you for caring!’"" Hughes told Fox News Digital. She served in the U.S. Coast Guard women's reserve, otherwise known as the SPARs.

""They acknowledged that filling U.S. shore jobs with women would allow more men to serve elsewhere and hasten the war effort.""ON VETERANS DAY, NEW YORK TEEN HONORS WWII VETERAN WITH MEMORIAL AND PERSONALIZED CREATIONSThe ""SPARs were the answer. These women were under military direction, and they were subject to assignment according to the needs of the service.""The site also explains, ""The jobs they were filling could not have been done by civilians working for the Armed Forces because they were not as mobile and did not fall under military law and discipline.""In Nashville, Hughes was among those honored during an event at the City Winery in October.  Recently, on Oct. 26 in Nashville, Hughes was among those honored during an event at the City Winery, the fourth annual Charlie Daniels Patriot Awards.The Charlie Daniels Journey Home Project (TCDJHP) — which Hughes has assisted — raised more than half a million dollars for American veterans, according to media materials shared with Fox News Digital.The evening featured live performances by entertainer Chris Young, the War Hippies (combat warriors Scooter Brown and Donnie Reis) — as well as a surprise appearance by Lee Greenwood, who performed his iconic hit, ""God Bless the USA.""

""It was a wonderful evening of patriotism, support and caring.""Gladys Hughes was one of two special guests — both World War II veterans — also honored at the dinner.Hughes felt the ""call of duty"" at a young age — and left college as a junior to enlist in the U.S. Coast Guard during WWII, serving as a HA1C medic. The organization said that ""she appreciates beauty at every stage and in every avenue of life, winning 2nd runner-up in the 2012 Ms. Veteran America competition, which works to promote issues of homeless female veterans.""TUNNEL TO TOWERS EMBARKS ON BOLD NEW EFFORT FOR AMERICA'S HOMELESS VETERANSShe was crowned Ms. Mississippi Senior America in 2003 and emphasized the importance of children's theater, TCDJHP also said, a field for which she's passionate.Hughes told Fox News Digital, ""I have never forgotten that l was in the military. Perhaps I was born patriotic. To this day I am proud to be an American and to have served in the U.S. Coast Guard SPARs.""She added, ""While in the service I learned a great deal. I learned not only a lot about myself, but also about our country and my responsibility to it.""""To this day I am proud to be an American and to have served in the U.S. Coast Guard SPARs."" Said she ""fulfilled"" a career interest ""as I worked in the sick bay. I met many people whose friendships have remained through the years. I learned discipline and the necessity of it. I learned respect.""VIRGINIA NAVY VETERAN SAYS ALL VETERANS DESERVE RESPECT, NOT JUST THOSE WHO SAW BATTLEHughes said that in the service, ""it was instilled in me that I was there ‘to free a man to fight.’ Fighting for our country was what had to be done after Pearl Harbor.""Of our veterans and of the Veterans Day holiday every year, Hughes said, ""Veterans Day is one way to honor and pay respect to all who have served."" She added, ""I was so proud to be part of the Charlie Daniels Patriot Awards event. To know and understand the mission of The Journey Home Project is very important to me.""CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTERShe noted that ""events and organizations like this are necessary to assist our military brothers and sisters who are hurting and/or are in need.""She said, ""The one question we should ask ourselves is, ‘What can I do to help?’""Hughes was an award-winning speech and drama teacher in Louisiana when she retired at 65 — and became involved with Final Salute Inc.

 Gabriel Hays | Fox News Facebook Twitter Flipboard Comments Print Email close Video MSNBC panel unpacks ‘alarmingly’ close midterms, calls Texas and Florida ‘laboratories of autocracy’ On MSNBC Saturday, host Ali Velshi and his guests expressed relief that Democrats weren’t crushed in the midterms but claimed Republican-controlled states are ""laboratories of autocracy."" On MSNBC Saturday morning, host Ali Velshi and his guests, NYU history professor Ruth Ben-Ghiat and author Joanne Freeman, expressed relief that Democrats weren’t crushed in the midterms but claimed that Republicans are continuing to grow in authoritarianism.During the segment, Ben-Ghiat claimed that Republican success in Texas and Florida proved those states are ""laboratories of autocracy,"" and mentioned her fear of Gov. Ron DeSantis, R-Fla., whom she called a ""smoother extremist"" than former President Donald Trump, someone she referred to as a ""vindictive authoritarian.""Freeman used her historical knowledge of Civil War-era American politics to note that threats to democracy happen when people who feel entitled to electoral wins, lose. MEDIA DEFENDING SLOW VOTE COUNT IN NEVADA, ARIZONA, GREW FRUSTRATED WITH STALLED TALLY IN 2020 IOWA CAUCUSES 
 MSNBC ""Velshi"" panel discusses the close midterm elections.
 (Screenshot/MSNBC)Velshi began the segment by mentioning his relief that the midterms weren’t a red wave for Republicans, though he asked Professor Ben-Ghiat if America was out of the woods from the threats to democracy allegedly posed by the GOP.He said, ""I feel a slightly lower level of anxiety than I did on Monday. But Ruth, one of the things you warned me about, because you talk about so much history about autocracy, and anti-democracy stuff that, I don’t know, is this just a blip on your radar? Should we be thinking we are out of any woods whatsoever?""The professor denied that democracy is out of harm’s way entirely, due to the gains Republicans made in red states. She replied, ""No, and of course the victory for, you know Greg Abbott and Ron DeSantis, and the Texas GOP, these places are going to double down their efforts and become even more laboratories of autocracy to scale up.""Though she provided a silver lining, stating, ""One of my mantra’s, I don’t usually say it on the show cause we are talking about, you know, threats that await us, is never underestimate the American people. Cause one of the big takeaways is that we can have confidence in our election system and confidence in our own ability to organize and to affect change.""Ben-Ghiat praised the Democratic wins in elections that she said came ""under very difficult circumstances."" She added, ""That is something to honor and to celebrate.""Velshi asked Freeman how she felt about the election, to which she claimed, ""On the one hand, it’s a relief, it could’ve been much worse, it was a victory in some ways for the democratic process. On the other hand, it is also true that that was a very close election and that matters.""KARI LAKE SLAMS CHAOTIC ARIZONA ELECTION TABULATION AS SHE CLOSES GAP ON HOBBS

 (Fox News Photo/Joshua Comins)She added that the closeness was ""alarming"" and a sign that ""this is not a moment to let down our guard."" Freeman mentioned ""fraught elections"" from American history and the behavior of those who felt ""entitled"" to win. ""What do the people do who expected to win, who felt entitled to win? What is it that they do when they don’t get what they feel entitled to, and, they are already prone to not necessarily being cozy with the democratic system?"" She added, ""So, I personally, as a historian looking back to the election of 1800, or the election of 1860, I am looking ahead and I’ve got my eyes open.""Pivoting on that point, Velshi referred to ""candidates who deny elections, candidates who, like Kari Lake in Arizona, who is already calling everyone a cheater and a loser,"" and asked Ben-Ghiat to speak about them.

And we saw that with Trump who couldn’t stand to lose and so, you know, organized a violent coup attempt, which half the country seems to be forgetting about right now.""She then laid into DeSantis, saying, ""also, the anointment of Ron DeSantis is very worrying to me because he is a smoother and more disciplined extremist.""  Gabriel Hays is an associate editor for Fox News Digital.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.The Houston Astros have locked up a key cog in their bullpen.The team and reliever Rafael Montero agreed to a three-year, $34.5 million deal just a week after the reliever helped the Astros win their second World Series title, according to multiple reports.Montero had by far the best season of his career, pitching to a 2.37 ERA out of the pen. In his 10 appearances in the postseason, the first of his career, he allowed just two earned runs in 9.1 innings (1.93 ERA). CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM

 (Elsa/Getty Images)Montero's turnaround was one of the biggest surprises in the majors this year. Before being traded to Houston last year, he had a career ERA of 5.29 with three separate teams: the New York Mets, Texas Rangers and Seattle Mariners.Despite his struggles throughout his career, Houston took a flier on him and his then-7.27 ERA that year, and he immediately became a dominant force in an already stout bullpen.Montero was traded along with Kendall Graveman at last year's trade deadline, a move that upset Mariners players because Graveman had been so good for them. Now that Montero is turning his career around, Seattle has another reason to hate the trade.

That was just a preview of what was to come in 2022.The signing comes just a day after the Astros and general manager James Click parted ways despite winning it all just a week ago.Montero was part of the Astros' combined no-hitter in Game 4 of the World Series along with Cristian Javier, Bryan Abre and Ryan Pressly.Montero owned a 2.48 ERA in 2018 with the Rangers, but every other season he pitched his ERA was over 4.00, and he had two seasons with an ERA over 6.00.

 Caitlin McFall | Fox News Facebook Twitter Flipboard Comments Print Email close Video GOP performance in midterms was a ‘let-down’: Sen. Shelley Moore Capito Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., weighs in on the conversation surrounding control of Congress as Nevada and Georgia Senate races remain undecided.The race for the prized Nevada Senate seat has come down to the wire as Republican candidate Adam Laxalt looks to hold on to his waning lead Saturday.""Here is where we are — we are up only 862 votes,"" he said in a Saturday tweet. ""The race will come down to 20-30K Election Day Clark drop off ballots.""Laxalt, who is facing off against incumbent Democrat Sen. Cortez Masto, said the narrow margins were down to mail-in ballots dropped off in Clark County, home to Las Vegas residents, and which were still being tallied.  
 Nevada Republican Senate nominee Adam Laxalt speaks at a Republican midterm election night party at Red Rock Casino on November 8, 2022, in Las Vegas, Nevada. 
 (Mario Tama/Getty Images)DEMOCRATS ONE WIN AWAY FROM KEEPING SENATELaxalt acknowledged the tight race and said the mail-in ballots were coming in with higher margins favoring Democrats than his campaign had originally anticipated. ""If they are GOP precincts or slightly DEM leaning then we can still win,"" he added. ""If they continue to trend heavy DEM then she will overtake us. ""Thanks for all the prayers from millions of Nevadans and Americans who hope we can still take back the Senate and start taking our country back,"" he told his supporters. Republicans have seen tighter races than they were expecting up and down ballots across the U.S., including in Nevada where Laxalt was favored to win ahead of the Tuesday election and where he took an immediate substantial lead over Cortez Masto.

 Facebook Twitter Instagram RSS Email CRIME Published November 12, 2022 1:47pm EST JonBenet's father reacts to Boulder police update in daughter's unsolved 1996 murder case: 'More of the same' Boulder police will consult the state's cold case team in 2023 — 26 years after JonBenet's 1996 murder 
 By
 Audrey Conklin | Fox News Facebook Twitter Flipboard Comments Print Email close Video Cutting edge DNA technology could help solve JonBenet Ramsey’s haunting murder case Fox News host Laura Ingle delivers an exclusive interview with JonBenet Ramsey’s father, John Ramsey, who hopes the recent advances in DNA technology will help find his daughter’s killer.JonBenet Ramsey's father John has some hope that his deceased six-year-old daughter's 1996 murder case could take a turn after the Boulder Police Department on Wednesday announced a new path to finding her killer — but he doesn't think it will be enough.BPD said it will consult the Colorado Cold Case Review Team in sometime in 2023 — 26 years after Ramsey found his daughter murdered in the basement of their family home on Dec. 26, 1996.John Ramsey, 78, said the police department's decision to partner with the state cold case team was ""the only encouraging thing"" he had read in BPD's statement.""Sadly, it sounded like more of the same…"" Ramsey told Fox News Digital, ""and that's not what we need. It's a good effort by their PR department, but that's not what we need to be done.""JONBENET RAMSEY CASE: BOULDER POLICE CONSULTING COLD CASE REVIEW TEAM NEARLY 26 YEARS AFTER 6-YEAR-OLD'S DEATH 
 JonBenet Ramsey was murdered in her family's Boulder, Colorado, home on Dec. 26, 1996.
 (Ramsey family handout)JonBenet's mother reported the six-year-old missing to police on the morning of Dec. 26, 1996, after finding a lengthy ransom note demanding $118,000 in exchange for JonBenet. John Ramsey found her body later that same day. Her killer has yet to be identified.Ramsey does think that his recent efforts to shed new light in the case in recent years may have helped inspire BPD's decision to consult the cold case team, but he's waiting for something more, and is willing to pursue potential legal action if significant developments in the case are not made soon.JONBENET RAMSEY CASE: FATHER REMEMBERS ‘DADDY’S GIRL' ON WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN HER 32ND BIRTHDAY""They would love for this case just to go away and put in a file cabinet that never gets opened. We're not gonna let that happen,"" Ramsey said. 
 JonBenet's mother reported the six-year-old missing to police on the morning of Dec. 26, 1996, before her father, John Ramsey, found her dead later that day in their basement.
 (John Ramsey)BPD says it has investigated leads from more than 21,000 tips, letters and emails and traveled to 19 states to speak with more than 1,000 people about the case.""This crime has left a hole in the hearts of many, and we will never stop investigating until we find JonBenet’s killer,"" Boulder Police Chief Maris Herold said in a Wednesday statement. ""That includes following up on every lead and working with our policing partners and DNA experts around the country to solve this tragic case. This investigation has always been and will continue to be a priority for the Boulder Police Department.""JONBENET RAMSEY COLD CASE: DNA EXPERT EXPLAINS HOW MYSTERY MIGHT BE SOLVED IN SHORT ORDERIn the spring of 2022, Ramsey helped release a petition that has since garnered more than 28,000 signatures calling on Colorado Gov. Jared Polis to allow an independent agency to take over the investigation from BPD. 
 JonBenet Ramsey would have turned 32 on Saturday, Aug. 6, 2022.
 (Ramsey family)The father of five has expressed discontent with BPD's handling of the case over the past 26 years and believes that independent research teams who have offered their assistance in the case can bring his daughter's killer to light. To do so, the city of Boulder and BPD must hand over the case evidence in their custody so items can be re-tested for DNA to potentially build a profile of the suspect(s).If they are able to build a more complete DNA profile of the suspect(s), that information can then be compared to millions of DNA profiles uploaded to public databases showing people’s unique genetic codes.JONBENET RAMSEY CASE: FATHER TO PURSUE LEGAL ACTION IF COLORADO IGNORES REQUEST FOR INDEPENDENT DNA TESTING""There are … two or three cutting-edge labs that have had great success,"" Ramsey explained. ""And they're they're private. They're not within the government. The government, by their own admission, the FBI told us this six or eight months ago: 'We don't have the latest technology that is only available in these outside labs,' and that's where we need to go. So, we want that to be done."" 
 Boulder police on Wednesday announced that they would be collaborating with the Colorado Cold Case Review Team in 2023 in its search for answers in the 1996 JonBenet Ramsey murder case.
 (Discovery+)Ramsey said he had sent his own DNA sample to Ancestry DNA, which sells DNA test kits for $25, so that his genetic code is available in its database. The company says on its website that it has ""surpassed 4 million customers in our DNA database"" and is ""proud to remain the largest consumer genetic testing company.""The 78-year-old father and grandfather said the process of trying to get answers over the past two and a half decades can get tiresome, but he is still motivated to keep going.JONBENET RAMSEY MURDER: FAMILY ‘ENCOURAGED’ BY RENEWED INTEREST IN CASE, DNA TESTING POSSIBILITIES""It gets weary to keep beating the same drum,"" he said.CrimeCon 2022 — a convention for true-crime enthusiasts, scientists, journalists and victims of crime alike to come together and discuss their similar or different experiences — re-energized Ramsey. He spoke at the convention to a room of several hundred people who remained silent as he told his side of the story after 25 years. 
 JonBenet Ramsey was mysteriously murdered in her family's Boulder, Colorado, home in December 1996.
 (Ramsey family collection/ Discovery+)CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP""I was just overwhelmed by the interest and supportive people that were behind us and that we can leverage,"" he said.On the one hand, Ramsey is hopeful that BPD seems willing to get help from the state cold case team to find new leads in his daughter's murder case. On the other hand, he said he doesn't know anything about the cold case team or who works for it, so he is unsure whether the 2023 partnership will reveal anything promising. Ramsey is also waiting to hear back from the Colorado governor to discuss next steps. Audrey Conklin is a digital reporter for Fox News Digital and FOX Business.

 ((Photo by AAron Ontiveroz/The Denver Post via Getty Images))""Practically speaking, when parents are relying on secular medical or psychological advice that stresses parental affirmation of the child’s desired identity as the only way to support the child, then the situation will prove unworkable,"" the archdiocese's document continues. ""Even if the parents and child express willingness to comply with relevant school rules in the short term, the situation is not workable because the family and the school are working from irreconcilable premises and moving towards incompatible goals.""Sally Odenheimer, a former Catholic who left the faith over differences of belief on LGBT issues, told the Denver Post, ""I felt if I was staying in the church, that meant I was supporting their ideology, but in order for things to change, I have to be involved."" ""People are leaving in droves. I came back because they are not going to win. There are more of us who do not agree with them, and we will not let them do this,"" she continued.One critic of the archdiocese, Tricia Williams, told the Denver Post that the church was ""hurting people"" and ""separating them from God"" by following the policies.PRIEST DEFIANT AFTER BISHOP REBUKES HIM FOR CONDEMNING 'LUNATIC' TRANSGENDERISM IN HOMILYIn 2019, the same year as the Archdiocese of Denver's document was released, the Vatican released a document titled ""Male and Female He Created Them."" The document explained the church's teaching that gender theory ""speaks of a gradual process of denaturalization, that is a move away from nature and towards an absolute option for the decision of the feelings of the human subject.""Pope Francis has been an outspoken critic of gender ideology, quoting his predecessor Benedict XVI in calling it ""the epoch of sin against God the Creator.""

He's intelligent! God created man and woman, God created the world this way, this way, this way, and we are doing the opposite,"" the pontiff told the bishops.

 Facebook Twitter Instagram RSS Email Midterm Elections Published November 12, 2022 1:05pm EST Democrats one win away from keeping Senate Nevada Republican Senate candidate Adam Laxalt says Nevada Senate race will come down to 20-30K Election Day Clark drop-off ballots 
 By
 Chris Pandolfo | Fox News Facebook Twitter Flipboard Comments Print Email close Video Senate control could come down to GA race Georgia Senate candidate Herschel Walker and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz discusses his continued fight for Georgia in runoff election with Raphael Warnok on ‘Jesse Watters Primetime.’With Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly's re-election victory over Republican Blake Masters, Democrats are now just one seat away from maintaining control of the Senate in what was predicted by many to be a GOP wave election year, but one that never materialized.  Tuesday's election results were a bitter disappointment for Republicans, as Democratic senators in Arizona and New Hampshire were able to fend off challengers endorsed by former President Donald Trump, while Sen. Raphael Warnock, D-Ga., and Republican Herschel Walker are headed into a runoff election on Dec. 6 after neither could win a 50% majority of the vote. Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet was handily re-elected in Colorado, as was Sen. Patty Murray (D) in Washington state. Each party currently holds 49 seats, and Democrats need just one more victory to hold onto their majority with Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris breaking ties. All eyes now turn to Nevada, where the Senate race remains too close to call, but Republican Adam Laxalt's early lead is shrinking radpidly. Updating his supporters on Saturday morning, Laxalt shared that he is only leading incumbent Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto by 862 votes.2022 MIDTERM ELECTION RESULTS 
 The Nevada U.S. Senate race between Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto and Republican Adam Laxalt is still undecided.
 (Associated Press)""Multiple days in a row, the mostly mail-in ballots counted continue to break in higher [Democratic] margins than we calculated. This has narrowed our victory window,"" Laxalt tweeted. ""The race will come down to 20-30K Election Day Clark drop off ballots."" ""If they are GOP precincts or slightly DEM leaning then we can still win,"" he added, optimistically. ""If they continue to trend heavy DEM then she will overtake us. Thanks for all the prayers from millions of Nevadans and Americans who hope we can still take back the Senate and start taking our country back."" If Cortez Masto is re-elected, control of the U.S. Senate will remain in Democratic hands. But if Laxalt prevails, the matter will be decided in four weeks in Georgia. Outside political groups have already ramped up spending there, with the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) making a six-figure ad purchase to attack Warnock as a ""great actor"" who ""votes with Joe Biden 96% of the time."" Republicans hope to avoid a repeat of the 2020 runoff elections in Georgia. Warnock, who is the minister at Atlanta’s famed Ebenezer Baptist Church, where Martin Luther King Jr. once preached, narrowly edged Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler in Georgia’s twin Jan. 5, 2021, Senate runoff elections. His victory, coupled with now-Democratic Sen. Jon Ossoff’s razor-thin win over GOP Sen. David Perdue, gave the Democrats the Senate majority. REPUBLICANS SPLIT ON TRUMP'S EFFECT ON LACKLUSTER MIDTERMS AS CONTROL OF CONGRESS HANGS IN BALANCE

 (AP Photo/Brynn Anderson | AP Photo/John Bazemore)The GOP's precarious predicament has led to finger-pointing over whom to blame for their losses. In an environment where President Biden has underwater approval ratings and historically high inflation is top of mind for voters, the widespread expectation was for Republicans to gain a large House majority and win back the Senate. The reality is that any House majority will be a slim one, and the Senate is still up in the air.  Some conservatives have shoveled blame at Trump, observing that he endorsed candidates who supported his unproven claims about the 2020 election in GOP primaries, and those candidates went on to lose. Trump blames Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and his Senate Leadership Fund PAC, which in August withdrew $8 million of ad spending from the Senate race in Arizona and redirected funds to support Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, in her ranked-choice contest against fellow Trump-endorsed Republican Kelly Tshibaka. ELECTION DAY 2022 IS OVER; READY OR NOT, HERE COMES 2024 WHITE HOUSE RACE

 (SAUL LOEB, MANDEL NGAN/AFP via Getty Images)The former president also argues that GOP losses have been overstated. Earlier this week, he told Fox News the people he endorsed ""did very well,"" observing that 216 of his candidates went on to win their races, while only 19 lost. Trump mentioned that Sens. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, Marco Rubio, R-Fla., Ron Johnson, R-Wis., and candidates Eric Schmitt in Missouri, J.D. Vance in Ohio, and Ted Budd in North Carolina had each won their races. Still, with control of the Senate hanging in the balance, some of Trump's advisers have called on him to delay his plans to launch another White House bid until after the Georgia runoff. Fox News' Paul Steinhauser contributed to this report.  Chris Pandolfo is a writer for Fox News Digital.

""Ukraine must liberate all of its citizens from this barbarity.""U.K. Defense Secretary Ben Wallace echoed this sentiment and highlighted a concern noted by some defense experts who have warned Russia’s withdrawal from Kherson could be a ploy.""While the withdrawal is welcome, no one is going to underestimate the threat posed by the Russian Federation,"" he said in a Saturday statement. Wallace said Russia’s withdraw from the southern city just two months after its forces were forced out of Kharkiv marked ""another strategic failure for them.""""Now with [Kherson] also being surrendered, ordinary people of Russia must surely ask themselves ‘What was it all for?’,"" he questioned. ""The Russian Army has suffered a huge loss of life as a result of their illegal invasion and have only achieved international isolationism and humiliation. Ukraine will press on.""

 Kristallnacht chicken: KFC Germany apologizes for 'unacceptable' promotion tied to anniversary of massacre Kristallnacht was the night Nazi groups carried out organized massacres of Jewish people Facebook Twitter Comments Print Email By Peter Aitken FOXBusiness close video Charles Payne: National Chicken Council has very hardworking men and women FOX Business host Charles Payne thanks the National Chicken Council for keeping America fed on 'Making Money.' KFC Germany issued an apology after a ""semi-automated"" push notification system promoted ""tender cheese with crispy chicken"" as a way to remember the anniversary of a Jewish massacre.  ""It's memorial day for Kristallnacht! Treat yourself with more tender cheese on your crispy chicken. Now at KFCheese!"" the message said according to the BBC. The company apologized for an ""obviously wrong, insensitive and unacceptable message"" pushed out on the Nov. 9 anniversary of Kristallnacht, the ""night of broken glass"" when a Nazi paramilitary group carried out an organized massacre of Jewish people.  The name derived from the morning after when broken glass from the shattered storefronts of Jewish-owned businesses littered the streets. An estimated 91 Jewish people died and 267 synagogues were destroyed, with many businesses looted, according to the Holocaust Memorial Day Trust.  ADIDAS ENDS PARTNERSHIP WITH KANYE WEST OVER ANTISEMITIC COMMENTSKFC Germany claimed in a statement that the message had generated as part of a ""semi-automated content creation process linked to calendars that include national observances.""  The exterior of a Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurant is seen on Feb. 5, 2022, in Dusseldorf, Germany.  (Jeremy Moeller/Getty Images / Getty Images)""In this instance, our internal review process was not properly followed, resulting in a nonapproved notification being shared,"" the statement said.NIKE SUSPENDS RELATIONSHIP WITH KYRIE IRVING AMID ANTISEMITIC CONTROVERSYThe company issued an apology within an hour of the push notification, saying it ""sincerely"" apologized for the ""unplanned, insensitive and unacceptable message."" Daniel Sugarman, the director of public affairs at the Board of Deputies of British Jews, called the message ""absolutely hideous,"" while Dalia Grinfeld, associate director for European affairs at the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) tweeted ""Shame on you!"" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX BUSINESS APPGermany’s Interior Minister Nancy Faeser said in Parliament on the night of the anniversary that the memory would ""forever remain a night of shame for our country.""  Markets Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Personal Finance MortgagesStudent LoansCredit CardsPersonal LoansSavingsInsurance401kRetirementTax PlanningEconomy Government SpendingMoney & PolicySmall BusinessInflationMarkets StocksUS MarketsCryptocurrencyFutures & CommoditiesBondsFunds & ETFsBusiness LeadersIndustriesRetailPre-MarketsWatchlist Lifestyle EntertainmentRich & FamousTravelCarsAirplanesFood & DrinksArtsReal Estate PersonalCommercialLuxury PropertiesTech DigitalSocial MediaGadgetsBusiness TechHealthcare TechFuture TechAISpaceSports NFLNBAMLBNASCARBoxingSoccerGolfTennisOpinion Shows Mornings with MariaVarney & CoCavuto: Coast to CoastMaking Money with Charles PayneThe Claman CountdownBulls & BearsThe Evening EditKennedyStrange Inheritance with Jamie ColbyMaria Bartiromo's Wall StreetWSJ at Large with Gerry BakerBarron's RoundtableAbout Channel FinderJobsTerms of UseUpdated Privacy PolicyFAQMedia RelationsCorporate InformationClosed Captioning PolicyAccessibility StatementFox NewsFox NationFox Business GoApps & Products Facebook Twitter Fox Business New Terms of Use New Privacy Policy Do Not Sell my Personal Information Help Closed Captioning Policy

 Facebook Twitter Instagram RSS Email Health Published November 12, 2022 12:12pm EST In Boston, RSV cases in kids creating a 'capacity disaster' for one major hospital Rates of RSV are about 20 to 60% higher than a typical fall, say medical experts 
 By
 Christine Rousselle | Fox News Facebook Twitter Flipboard Comments Print Email close Video Doctors on high alert as RSV wreaks havoc on babies, small children Fox News medical contributor Dr. Marc Siegel discusses the possibility of a 'triple-demic' as COVID-19, influenza and RSV raise concerns ahead of the winter months.One of the nation's top hospitals announced on Thursday, Nov. 10, that it is at capacity and is reducing elective surgeries due to an unusually high number of patients with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).Another nearby hospital is having similar issues.Massachusetts General for Children, located in Boston, said that in the first 10 days of November there have been more than 1,000 reported cases of RSV. In the entire month of October, there were about 2,000 reported cases of RSV. EARLY, SURPRISING SURGE OF RSV IN KIDS HAS HOSPITALS, MEDICAL CENTERS CONCERNEDRSV is causing a ""capacity disaster,"" Brian Cummings, the medical director of the department of pediatrics at Massachusetts General for Children, said in a news conference on Thursday afternoon, as Boston 25 News reported.Cummings said that this year's RSV cases are about ""20% to 60% higher"" than those of a typical fall — and that winter, not fall, is usually the hardest-hit season for RSV.  
 Typical symptoms of RSV include stuffy nose, congestion, cough and fever. 
 (iStock)The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) notes that nearly every child has contracted RSV by the time they turn two years old, and most cases of it are mild. Typical symptoms of RSV include stuffy nose, congestion, cough and fever. Some children who contract RSV require hospitalization. ""Even if just 10% need hospitalization, it creates a lot of stress on health care facilities,"" said Cummings during the press conference on Thursday. ""We’ve had over 250 hospitalizations for RSV alone on top of other circulating viruses.""AMOXICILLIN PRESCRIBED FOR CHILDREN IS IN SHORT SUPPLY, FDA SAYSCummings said RSV is causing ""very severe respiratory illness in young children,"" which is creating breathing difficulties or exacerbating asthma. He added that there are no pediatric ICU beds currently available at the hospital and that there are ""seven patients that are outside the ICU that would normally be transferred into the ICU.""  
 A mom checks her sick daughter's throat. RSV ""can cause inflammation in the lungs. It can cause infection in the lungs like pneumonia.""
 (iStock)Dr. Janette Neshewiat, a Fox News medical contributor based in New York City, recently told Fox News Digital of RSV, ""This is a virus that can cause inflammation in the lungs. It can cause infection in the lungs like pneumonia.""""The younger you are when infected, the more likely you are to have a more acute presentation."" She added, ""And what we're seeing now is it's causing about 60,000 hospitalizations in children every year. For every three children [who] are hospitalized with COVID, we're seeing up to 30 hospitalized with RSV.""JUST 2 OMICRON SUBVARIANTS MAKE UP 44% OF ALL US COVID CASESThe number of children with respiratory illnesses has ""ballooned through the entire month of October,"" said Cummings — which has ""created enormous stress on pediatric health care.""  
 There are no pediatric ICU beds currently available at Massachusetts General Hospital for Children in Boston. 
 (REUTERS/Brian Snyder)As a result, some non-emergency surgeries are being delayed to free up doctors and hospital space for emergency treatment. Due to the coronavirus pandemic, many children who would have contracted RSV did not, as people were staying home and doing other mitigation efforts, said Cummings.FLU SYMPTOMS AND PREVENTION: EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT COMMON SIGNS, TREATMENT AND AVOIDING INFLUENZA""What’s happened in the last two years with COVID is that a lot of the pandemic mitigations have disrupted the normal viral transmission,"" he said. ""A lot of RSV was not being spread in the previous two years.""""If at any point it looks like your baby is not breathing well at all, just bring them right to an emergency room."" ""Now that it’s circulating a little more, typically there are many more people susceptible to infection. The younger you are when you get infected, the more likely you are to have a more acute presentation,"" Cummings said on Thursday.CDC WARNS DENTAL PATIENTS OF RARE BACTERIAL INFECTIONS VIA WATERLINESHe explained that ""the youngest patients are at the highest risk of needing hospitalization,"" particularly those under the age of one — and that these hospital stays are usually brief.  
 Most RSV cases can be treated at home with fluids, rest and fever control, but some cases do need to be treated at a hospital. 
 (iStock)Boston Children's Hospital is also experiencing similar capacity issues as Massachusetts General for Children. ""Boston Children’s has been at or overcapacity on average for nearly six weeks due to RSV, seasonal illnesses and the ongoing behavioral health crisis,"" the hospital said in a statement cited by Boston 25 News. GROUP HUG!

 By
 Chris Pandolfo | Fox News Facebook Twitter Flipboard Comments Print Email close Video Chris Pratt endorses billionaire over liberal Democrat in Los Angeles mayor race ‘Fox & Friends’ hosts Ainsley Earhardt, Steve Doocy and Brian Kilmeade discuss the Los Angeles mayoral race, where actor Chris Pratt endorsed billionaire Rick Caruso over liberal Democrat Karen Bass.Democratic Rep. Karen Bass has grabbed the lead over billionaire businessman Rick Caruso in the hotly contested Los Angeles mayoral race, but there are still hundreds of thousands of votes to be counted. The latest returns from the Los Angeles County Registrar's Office show Bass up by 4,384 votes, leading Caruso, a former Republican, with 289,782 votes (50.4%) to 285,398 votes (49.6%). But nearly 40% of the ballots remain uncounted, and the race remains too close to call. Voter turnout is estimated to be about 27%, according to the Registrar's Office. Los Angeles County election officials on Friday estimated there more than 800,000 ballots that need to be counted. Those include about 790,000 vote by mail ballots, 21,000 conditional voter registration ballots, and 300 provisional ballots. MIDTERM ELECTION RESULTS: THESE KEY RACES HAVE YET TO BE CALLED

""These ballots are not included in the estimate."" Though Bass, a progressive congresswoman, is favored to win in the traditionally far-left city, Caruso has attracted several celebrity endorsements after pledging to change how the city approaches crime and its homelessness crisis. Actor Chris Pratt, Kim Kardashian, Katy Perry, Elon Musk and others had endorsed Caruso in the months leading up to the election. TRUMP BLASTS MARICOPA COUNTY AFTER ARIZONA SEN.

 By
 Brian Flood , Nikolas Lanum | Fox News Facebook Twitter Flipboard Comments Print Email close Video Babylon Bee speaks out on support of man arrested over parody local police Facebook account Babylon Bee Editor in Chief Kyle Mann discusses the amicus brief sent to the Supreme Court on behalf of Ohio comedian Anthony Novak.Parody is essential to a free society and the First Amendment is pointless if Americans can’t mock government officials, according to satirical website The Babylon Bee. ""That’s a scary society if you can’t make fun of the government,"" Babylon Bee editor-in-chief Kyle Mann told Fox News Digital. The Babylon Bee recently filed an amicus brief to the Supreme Court to support Anthony Novak, a man who created a parody Facebook page in 2016 to mock his local police department in Parma, Ohio. Novak mocked local law enforcement with six parody posts, but he was jailed and prosecuted for a felony under Ohio law prohibiting the use of a computer to ""disrupt"" or ""interrupt"" police functions.Novak was acquitted and he eventually sued for the violation of his First and Fourth Amendment rights, but the Sixth Circuit found that there was probable cause to believe Novak’s protected speech was criminal and the officers were entitled to qualified immunity. BABYLON BEE'S KYLE MANN DEFENDS SATIRE OFFERING 'LIGHT, LAUGHTER' IN THE MIDST OF DARK TIMES 
 The Babylon Bee recently filed an amicus brief to the Supreme Court to support Anthony Novak, a man who created a parody Facebook page in 2016 to mock his local police department in Parma, Ohio.
 (Babylon )The Bee, a wildly popular satirical website, joined the liberal parody site, The Onion, and urged the Supreme Court to hear the case. ""What we're trying to do is get this heard by the Supreme Court so that a private citizen who is doing a parody of, you know, whoever it is, especially government entities and police and those in authority aren't in danger… those people wouldn't be in danger of being arrested for that,"" Mann said.Police officers allegedly claimed the spoof website was causing confusion within the community, and it was an emergency situation that needed to be shut down immediately, but Mann thinks they simply didn’t get the joke. ""I think it was probably fairly obvious that it was a parody page from some of the stuff that he posted. But at the same time… whether a parody is distinguishable from reality or not should not be a factor in whether or not it's protected by the First Amendment,"" Mann said. ""In fact, parody requires some kind of buy in from the audience in order to work as parody and satire.""The amicus brief, filed on Oct. 28, defends satire at all costs and declares The Onion may be ""staffed by socialist wackos"" but effectively defended parody to this Court in its own brief. ""Like Mr. Novak, The Bee is frequently the target of censorship and attacks from powerful people who don’t get—or at least don’t appreciate—its jokes. The Bee has faced the ire of a diverse group of establishment-media types—including The New York Times, The Washington Post, and CNN—and the wrath of the massive tech companies who functionally control the lion’s share of public debate in our society,"" Babylon Bee legal counsel Emmett E. Robinson wrote. BABYLON BEE CEO: LIBERALS DECIDE WHAT’S ALLOWED, BIG TECH ENFORCES THEIR RULES THROUGH TERMS OF SERVICE Video""Truth is stranger than fiction. And fiction is illegal. At least in the Sixth Circuit. That court’s decision—depriving Petitioner Anthony Novak of any opportunity to hold accountable those who searched his home, arrested him, and jailed him because the parody he wrote was too effective—should be reviewed by this Court on the merits. First, parody plays an invaluable role in a free society. When parody is imperiled, citizens are deprived of one of their most effective means of criticizing the government,"" the brief continued. ""Second, the Sixth Circuit’s ruling will allow the state to punish vast swaths of speech erstwhile protected by the First Amendment. The Bee and its writers could be held criminally liable for many, if not most, of the articles The Bee publishes.""The Bee’s amicus brief also stated that ""the prospect that an individual or entity charged with a speech crime might ultimately be vindicated at a criminal trial does little, if anything, to temper the speech-chilling effects of the decision below,"" and called the Sixth Circuit’s decision a ""qualified-immunity-on-steroids approach"" that will allow state actors to prosecute satirists at will. ""Knowledge that they may be searched, arrested, jailed, and prosecuted without recourse is enough to dissuade most would-be speakers, regardless of the potential for ultimate acquittal,"" the Bee’s brief stated. JOHN CLEESE SAYS WOKENESS HAS A ‘DISASTROUS’ IMPACT ON COMEDY VideoMann feels the case is part of the ""parcel of the attack on comedy that's going on in our nation,"" but it’s not quite the same as the political correctness discussion that has caused backlash to comics like Dave Chappelle. The Babylon Bee has its own set of critics and is regularly attacked by the left for violating their ever-changing rules of comedy. The case surrounding Novak doesn’t concern someone who’s being too sensitive or had their feelings hurt with a joke. It doesn’t even have to do with cancel culture, according to Mann, who thinks this could be even worse. ""It's actually the government coming after speech, so it's almost more chilling in some way,"" Mann said. ""It's the government cracking down and saying, ‘You can't do this. You can't make fun of this police department,’"" Mann said. ""So it is certainly an attack on comedy, and I do think it's kind of downstream from culture where we've arrived at a place in a society where people can't understand humor a lot anymore. They don't recognize humor. And for us, that's concerning as people whose entire careers and livelihoods depend on humor thriving in our culture."" The Bee also published a satirical brief on its website that claimed the Constitution was written before the internet, and jokes, weren’t even invented yet. GET THE FOX NEWS APP BY CLICKING HERE""So, you know, the First Amendment was not intended to cover jokes,"" Mann said. ""Obviously, we're satirically making the point that if you look at the purpose of the First Amendment, if it doesn't defend mocking government officials, then what's the purpose of it?"" Mann feels it’s critical that the Supreme Court rules the First Amendment protects humor. ""Especially humor that that makes fun of government officials. I mean, that's one of our great national pastimes is mocking the government,"" he said. ""Humor is one of the most powerful tools for communicating truth, it’s one of the most powerful tools for making a point.""A response brief is due November 28.  Brian Flood is a media reporter for Fox News Digital.

 Facebook Twitter Instagram RSS Email True Crime Published November 12, 2022 11:59am EST Baby Holly case: Genetic genealogist who helped ID murdered Texas couple explains how she cracked the case In June, Texas authorities discovered missing 'Baby Holly' alive and well as a 42-year-old woman 
 By
 Audrey Conklin | Fox News Facebook Twitter Flipboard Comments Print Email close Video 'What About Holly?' In this multi-part true crime podcast, host Cristina Corbin travels across the country to interview law enforcement and family members, uncover new leads and speak exclusively with a religious cult at the center of this double murder mystery.In 1980, a young couple moved from Florida to Texas with their infant daughter, Holly Marie, before they vanished.The last time family and friends of Harold ""Dean"" Clouse Jr., 21, and Tina Gail Linn Clouse, 17, had heard from the couple was October 1980, when Tina sent a letter to Dean's mother, Donna Casasanta, with photos of Holly standing upright and pushing her walker.On Jan. 12, 1981, a man walking in the woods with his German Shepherd came across the badly decomposed remains of two people along Wallisville Road, on the outskirts of Houston, some 265 miles from the Clouses' last known address in Lewisville. Investigators were unable to identify the two victims — a man who had been beaten to death and a woman who had been strangled.Nearly 40 years later, in October 2021, a team of genetic genealogists with Identifinders International, LLC, was able to identify the deceased as Dean and Tina Clouse.LISTEN TO 'WHAT ABOUT HOLLY?' PODCAST 
 The last time family and friends of Harold ""Dean"" Clouse Jr., 21, and Tina Gail Linn, 17, had heard from the couple was October 1980, when Tina sent a letter to Dean's mother, Donna Casasanta, with photos of Holly standing upright and pushing her walker.
 (Courtesy of the Clouse family)""I was exhilarated in the sense that, you know, I could return his identity to him and that … he has a name now. He has a story, a family,"" senior forensic genealogist Misty Gillis told Fox News Digital of the moment she was able to identify Dean Clouse's remains.She continued: ""It's really hard when you identify somebody, because although you're returning identity to them, and you're giving them back the sense of being a person … you start to think about your own life and your own family and things like that. I mean, he was a son. He was a father. He was a brother. And there's a ripple effect.""LISTEN TO MORE TRUE CRIME PODCASTS FROM FOX NEWSGillis began her career in genetic genealogy about three-and-a-half years ago, after she helped her grandfather discover the identity of his own father. She then decided to direct her passion and self-made expertise in genealogy research into a full-time career helping to identify human remains and cracking cold-case homicides and sexual assaults.Gillis initiated her research into the Clouse cold case in 2021 after she came across the then-unidentified couple's photo illustrations on The Doe Network — a nonprofit dedicated to shedding light on cold cases. She noticed that their deaths were connected, which she thought was unusual, because ""you might find same-sex remains if it's a dumping ground for a serial killer or something like that, but the fact that it was a man and a woman involved … I was very intrigued by it.""

 (Family History Detectives)""Were they brother and sister? Were they lovers? Were they friends? What's the story?"" Gillis recalled thinking at the time. ""What could have happened to them that they were both so young when they were found together?""Indentifinders International reached out to Harris County, which sent the remains to a lab that works with Indentifinders. The lab work creating a DNA profile for the couple's remains took about four months, and the genealogy research took about seven days before Gillis and fellow genetic genealogist Allison Peacock, founder of FHD Forensics, identified the couple as Dean Clouse and Tina Linn.LOW COUNTRY KILLINGS: PROSECUTORS DEMAND ALIBI FROM SOUTH CAROLINA SCION""Peacock and myself got on a three-way call and called [Dean's] sister and said, 'Is there any chance there's somebody missing in your family?' And she said, ‘Yes, my brother Dean.’ And we said, ‘Well, we regret to inform you, but we believe we’ve identified his remains, found in 1981 in Harris County, Texas.’ And that's when she dropped the ball and said, ‘What about his wife and kid?’""Gills had no idea Baby Holly was part of the Clouse family picture until that moment.  
 Nearly 40 years later, in October 2021, a team of genetic genealogists with Identifinders International, LLC, was able to identify the deceased as Dean and Tina Clouse.
 (Texas Attorney General's Office)At that point, Peacock contacted the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, which opened an investigation into the apparently missing child.In June, Texas authorities announced that they had found ""Baby Holly"" — an infant who vanished after her mother and father were mysteriously killed in 1980 — alive and well as a 42-year-old woman. WATCH ‘THE GIRL SCOUT MURDERS’ ON FOX NATIONThe story captured the nation's attention as it not only brought some answers to a nearly 40-year-old cold case but also shed light on the possibilities of independent genetic genealogy research. Donna Casasanta said at the time that her family had learned of Holly’s well-being on Dean’s birthday, calling the news ""a birthday present from heaven.""""I prayed for more than 40 years for answers, and the Lord has revealed some of it ... we have found Holly,"" she said. ""Thank you to all of the investigators for working so hard to find Holly. I prayed for them day after day and that they would find Holly and she would be alright."" 
 Harold ""Dean"" Clouse Jr., 21, and Tina Gail Linn, 17, had just moved from Florida to Texas in 1980 when they disappeared.
 (Clouse family)Texas First Assistant Attorney General Brent Webster revealed that baby Holly ""was left in a church in Arizona and was taken into their care."" None of the people who cared for Holly were considered suspects, he added. Webster described how a pair of women ""who identified themselves as members of a nomadic religious group"" brought Holly to the church.WATCH ‘THE GIRL SCOUT MURDERS’ ON FOX NATION""They indicated the beliefs of their religion included the separation of male and female members, practicing vegetarian habits and not using or wearing leather goods,"" he said. ""The women indicated they had given up a baby before at a laundromat.""The group is said to have traveled around the southwest region of the country, such as California, Arizona and possible Texas.

 By
 Peter Aitken | Fox News Facebook Twitter Flipboard Comments Print Email close Video Netanyahu: 'Power maintains peace,' saw 'eye to eye' with Trump Former Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sat down for an exclusive interview with Fox News Digital to discuss his upcoming election and views on security in the Middle East. Israeli Prime Minister-elect Benjamin Netanyahu worries that antisemitism has developed into a more subtle hatred that has allowed people to more easily normalize it. ""I would say that antisemitism today has taken on a pernicious new form, because it's not fashionable to say you're an antisemite,"" Netanyahu said during an interview with The Blaze. ""You say, ‘Well, I'm anti-Zionist’ - You don't even say, ‘I'm anti-Israel,’ you say, ‘I'm anti-Zionist.’""""Well, I'm not against the Jews, I just don't think they should have a state of their own,"" he clarified. ""It's like, I'm not anti-American, I just don't think you should be an American.""Netanyahu secured a third run as prime minister of Israel after his coalition secured a majority in November's election. His return to power comes at a time when antisemitism is on the rise across the world: Antisemitic incidents reported in the United States reached an ""all-time high"" in 2021, with an average of seven incidents per day, according to the Anti-Defamation League (ADL). CHARGES ANNOUNCED OVER THREATS TO NJ SYNAGOGUES, SUSPECT HAD HISTORY OF ANTI-JEWISH SENTIMENTIn 2019, a study found that 25% of Europeans hold antisemitic beliefs, which ADL CEO Jonathan Greenblatt called ""deeply concerning.""

""The Jews are accused by the communists of being capitalists, by the capitalists of being communists … It's as old as time."" 
 Kanye West posted on Instagram that his upcoming LA show has been canceled, just hours after his bombshell interview with Tucker Carlson on Fox News Channel.
 (Fox News)""But what has changed is that antisemitism. It ebbs and flows,"" he added. ""What has changed is the capacity of the Jewish people to defend themselves against antisemitism, and especially against violent antisemitism.""In his talk with Beck, Netanyahu went further and said that people ""blame the Jews categorically, which is absurd."" ""You wouldn't do that with any group. Antisemites are just anti-Jews ... It just happens to be a definition of the complete negation of the Jewish people, per se,"" he clarified. ""That's it."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPADL stats indicated last year’s antisemitism incident rate increased 34% over the previous year.

 Facebook Twitter Instagram RSS Email Media Published November 12, 2022 11:35am EST Media defending slow vote count in Nevada, Arizona, grew frustrated with stalled tally in 2020 Iowa caucuses Vote counting is still ongoing in major midterm election races in Arizona and Nevada 
 By
 Gabriel Hays | Fox News Facebook Twitter Flipboard Comments Print Email close Video The Ingraham Angle - Friday, November 11 Arizona, Nevada, Populist MovementAs mainstream media pundits have been defending the multi-day long vote counts for Arizona and Nevada’s midterm races, urging a frustrated electorate that this is ""normal,"" ""ordinary,"" and ""part of the process,"" press coverage of the 2020 Democratic Iowa caucuses showed hosts and pundits growing exasperated over the stalled vote tally.Media watchdog outlet NewsBusters compiled two video montages, one of the media’s reactions to 2022’s still ongoing vote count, and one of reactions to the delayed counting in the key 2020 Democratic presidential caucus state.Side by side, the videos reveal two contradictory media attitudes to similar prolonged vote tabulation processes. KARI LAKE SLAMS CHAOTIC ARIZONA ELECTION TABULATION AS SHE CLOSES GAP ON HOBBS 
 PHOENIX, ARIZONA - NOVEMBER 11: Election workers open mail-in ballots at the Maricopa County Tabulation and Election Center on November 11, 2022, in Phoenix, Arizona. Ballots continue to be counted in Maricopa County three days after voters went to the polls for the midterm election in Arizona. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) 
 (Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)The footage from 2022 show pundits such as MSNBC's Katy Tur, MSNBC contributor Michael Steele, and CNN’s John King, among others, urging viewers to stay calm and recognize that Arizona taking nearly four days now to count its votes for the governor and U.S. Senate race is part of the process.However, the video from 2020 reveals growing frustrations among many of the pundits from these mainstream networks that vote counting was being dragged out over multiple days to decide who won the major Democratic contest in Iowa.Watching these videos in succession reveals the hypocrisy of the media concerning the country’s vote counting process.In the 2022 video, Tur urged her viewers to understand that the count in Arizona and Nevada is ""gonna take time, and that is normal."" ABC reporter Terry Moran told ""Good Morning America"" viewers, ""This is normal. Ordinary Arizonans will continue the ordinary work of counting votes."" 
 The race between GOP candidate Kari Lake and Democrat Katie Hobbs is still undecided.
 MSNBC political analyst Michael Steele is shown telling MSNBC viewers, ""This is part of the process. This is normal. Don’t get upset."" CNN anchors and correspondents are then shown in quick succession saying the counting process ""takes time"" as if it were a talking point. CNN anchor John King told viewers, ""We need to be patient."" NBC late night host Seth Meyers says, ""We have to be patient,"" and CNN anchor Don Lemon claims, ""And they’re working really, really hard to get everything done in a timely fashion, and so patience, patience, patience."" TRUMP BLASTS MARICOPA COUNTY AFTER ARIZONA SEN. MARK KELLY DEFEATS BLAKE MASTERS: 'DO ELECTION OVER AGAIN!'However, in the compilation of 2020 reactions to extended Iowa vote counts, pundits from some of the same outlets were shown clearly lacking patience. That video opens with MSNBC anchor Hallie Jackson quipping, ""Breaking this morning, the Iowa Caucuses. They’re what’s breaking because the system is actually broken."" Then-CNN anchor Chris Cuomo calls the delayed results an ""epic failure by the Iowa state Democratic Party."" MSNBC host Stephanie Ruhle is shown emphatically saying, ""We still don’t know the numbers."" CBS’s Gayle King makes flippant remarks, saying, ""It seems the jokes are gonna start writing themselves."" The video then provides a quick succession of cuts with journalists from CNN, MSNBC and ABC claiming ""chaos"" with regard to the count. 
 The Nevada U.S. Senate race between Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto and Republican Adam Laxalt is still undecided.
 (Associated Press)CLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPCNN anchor Van Jones then calls the count ""a real debacle,"" and a then-""CBS This Morning"" anchor describes it as ""not a good look for Democrats.""NewsBusters senior research analyst Bill D’Agostino, who compiled both videos, captioned the latter, stating, ""FLASHBACK: Vote counting for the 2020 Democratic Iowa Caucus was so abysmally bad that even the media dunked on it. Keep in mind, this is the same media who are now wagging their fingers at you like kindergarten teachers, and lecturing you about patience in Arizona and Nevada.""

 Caitlin McFall | Fox News Facebook Twitter Flipboard Comments Print Email close Video Ukraine remains cautious despite Russian troops withdrawing from Kherson Senior foreign affairs correspondent Greg Palkot reports on the ongoing fighting in the war in Ukraine, following Russia withdrawing forces from the Kherson region.Russia is looking to add more sophisticated weaponry to its stocks and ordered ""several dozen"" Tsirkon hypersonic missiles this fall, state-owned news outlet TASS reported Friday.The order is reportedly set to be fulfilled by the end of 2023 and comes after the Kremlin order a ""batch of Tsirkons"" during the summer of 2021. The report comes just days after Tehran, which has aided Russia in its war in Ukraine, announced that it had developed its own hypersonic missile – prompting some to question of whether Moscow had assisted its Middle Eastern ally in developing the sophisticated weaponry, though U.S. defense officials have expressed skepticism over the authenticity of Tehran's claims.  
 FILE - In this file photo taken from a video distributed by Russian Defense Ministry Press Service, on Dec. 9, 2020, a ground-based intercontinental ballistic missile was launched from the Plesetsk facility in northwestern Russia. 
 (Russian Defense Ministry Press Service via AP, File)IRAN CLAIMS TO HAVE BUILT HYPERSONIC BALLISTIC MISSILEHypersonic missiles are not only capable of traveling over five times faster than the speed of sound, at a rate of 3,800 mph, they also can travel on complex trajectories, which makes them difficult to defend against, the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute reported.Russian armed forces have reportedly launched ""multiple"" hypersonic missiles in Ukraine since the war began, according to top U.S. defense officials, though it remains unclear how many of the missiles remain in Russia's stocks.The Kremlin has seen significant setbacks in its arms supplies and ability to hold its military lines in Ukraine, and Kyiv saw one of its greatest achievements Friday after Russian forces withdrew from the southern city of Kherson.While Ukraine and Western allies have championed Ukraine’s advancement, former DIA intelligence officer for Russian Doctrine & Strategy Rebekah Koffler cautioned that the withdrawal could be a trap. 
 Russia said it tested a hypersonic Zircon cruise missile in the Barents Sea, Saturday, May 28, 2022.

 Joe Morgan | Fox News Facebook Twitter Flipboard Comments Print Email close Video Fox News Flash top sports headlines for November 12 Fox News Flash top sports headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.In a 40-day period during the offseason, Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback Tom Brady retired and unretired, deciding that he wasn’t quite done with football as he returned for his 23rd NFL season. The return has not gone as planned.  
 Tom Brady #12 of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers passes the ball during the second quarter in the game against the Los Angeles Rams at Raymond James Stadium on November 6, 2022, in Tampa, Florida. 
 (Mike Ehrmann/Getty Images)The Bucs have struggled, going 4-5 to start the season with an offense ranked 25th in the NFL in points per game (18.0). Prior to last week’s last-second win over the Los Angeles Rams, Tampa Bay had lost three straight with Brady throwing for just two touchdowns in the three-game stretch.  NFL TO HONOR LATE JOHN MADDEN BY STARTING ANNUAL THANKSGIVING TRADITIONBut the struggles have not left a sour taste in Brady’s mouth on his decision to return to football after retiring in the offseason.  
 Tom Brady was not happy with his first half performance in his game against the New Orleans Saints, Sunday.
 (Chris Graythen)""Zero. No definitely not,"" Brady said Friday when asked whether he has any regrets about unretiring. ""I think I returned because I felt like I wanted to compete. And I spoke to the team about it, and they were excited to have me back. I don’t really regret those types of things. When I commit to it, I mean it, and I do my best and try to give everything I can to this particular opportunity."" Even at 4-5, the Bucs are still in first place in the weak NFC South with a matchup against the first-place Seattle Seahawks in Germany on Sunday CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM""I think the frustrating part is we just haven't played to the way we're capable of playing. And that's for a number of different reasons,"" Brady continued. ""This is a very important game for us – we have a bye week after this. It gives you a chance to kind of evaluate where you're at, and I'd much rather evaluate being 5-5 than 4-6. We've got to just win this game, and it'll take care of that.""

 Maureen Mackey | Fox News Facebook Twitter Flipboard Comments Print Email close Video 'Fox & Friends' encourages you to make camo your cause for Veterans Day 'Fox & Friends' anchors Ainsley Earhardt, Steve Doocy and Brian Kilmeade honor America's veterans by sharing how viewers can make camo their cause and support America's heroes.Veteran Gladys Hughes, age 99, has an enduring message for all as the nation celebrates Veterans Day this year and continues to remember all of our military veterans throughout the weekend and every day of the year.It's about veterans and their importance to this country. She told Fox News Digital via email, ""When someone says to me, ‘Thank you for your service,’ I want to shout out to them, ‘Thank you for caring!’""MEET THE AMERICAN WHO INSPIRED THE NATION IN TWO WORLD WARS: CHRISTIAN SOLDIER SGT. ALVIN YORK""The men and women who have served our country are responsible for the many freedoms that we have,"" said Hughes, who is today based in Carriere, Mississippi. ""In some way, since I was in the military, I know what these veterans have gone through.""  
 Gladys Hughes is honored in October 2022 in Nashville by The Charlie Daniels Journey Home Project. ""When someone says to me, ‘Thank you for your service,’ I want to shout out to them, ‘Thank you for caring!’"" Hughes told Fox News Digital. She served in the U.S. Coast Guard women's reserve, otherwise known as the SPARs.
 (Robyn McIsaac/The Charlie Daniels Journey Home Project)""No, not the war or the fighting — but the mental, physical and emotional strength they have to have to serve our country.""VETERANS DAY BY THE NUMBERS: 8 FACTS ABOUT THE FEDERAL HOLIDAYHughes — a longtime teacher, educator, debate coach, playwright and now writer — served in the Coast Guard Women's Reserve, also known as the SPARs.During World War II, the Coast Guard and the other services ""found themselves in great need of more men at sea and more troops on foreign soil,"" the Coast Guard explains on its website. ""The men and women who have served our country are responsible for the many freedoms that we have."" ""They acknowledged that filling U.S. shore jobs with women would allow more men to serve elsewhere and hasten the war effort.""ON VETERANS DAY, NEW YORK TEEN HONORS WWII VETERAN WITH MEMORIAL AND PERSONALIZED CREATIONSThe ""SPARs were the answer. These women were under military direction, and they were subject to assignment according to the needs of the service.""The site also explains, ""The jobs they were filling could not have been done by civilians working for the Armed Forces because they were not as mobile and did not fall under military law and discipline.""In Nashville, Hughes was among those honored during an event at the City Winery in October.  Recently, on Oct. 26 in Nashville, Hughes was among those honored during an event at the City Winery, the fourth annual Charlie Daniels Patriot Awards.The Charlie Daniels Journey Home Project (TCDJHP) — which Hughes has assisted — raised more than half a million dollars for American veterans, according to media materials shared with Fox News Digital.The evening featured live performances by entertainer Chris Young, the War Hippies (combat warriors Scooter Brown and Donnie Reis) — as well as a surprise appearance by Lee Greenwood, who performed his iconic hit, ""God Bless the USA.""

 (Robyn McIsaac/The Charlie Daniels Journey Home Project)The Charlie Daniels Patriot Awards this year were presented to actor and humanitarian Gary Sinise, Army combat veteran and TCDJHP Ambassador Joel Pruitt and Nashville businessman Lee Beaman.""Once again, those who are concerned about the welfare of our returning veterans came to make a difference,"" said TCDJHP co-founder and Daniels' longtime manager David Corlew. ""It was a wonderful evening of patriotism, support and caring.""Gladys Hughes was one of two special guests — both World War II veterans — also honored at the dinner.Hughes felt the ""call of duty"" at a young age — and left college as a junior to enlist in the U.S. Coast Guard during WWII, serving as a HA1C medic. The organization said that ""she appreciates beauty at every stage and in every avenue of life, winning 2nd runner-up in the 2012 Ms. Veteran America competition, which works to promote issues of homeless female veterans.""TUNNEL TO TOWERS EMBARKS ON BOLD NEW EFFORT FOR AMERICA'S HOMELESS VETERANSShe was crowned Ms. Mississippi Senior America in 2003 and emphasized the importance of children's theater, TCDJHP also said, a field for which she's passionate.Hughes told Fox News Digital, ""I have never forgotten that l was in the military. Perhaps I was born patriotic. To this day I am proud to be an American and to have served in the U.S. Coast Guard SPARs.""She added, ""While in the service I learned a great deal. I learned not only a lot about myself, but also about our country and my responsibility to it.""""To this day I am proud to be an American and to have served in the U.S. Coast Guard SPARs."" Said she ""fulfilled"" a career interest ""as I worked in the sick bay. I met many people whose friendships have remained through the years. I learned discipline and the necessity of it. I learned respect.""VIRGINIA NAVY VETERAN SAYS ALL VETERANS DESERVE RESPECT, NOT JUST THOSE WHO SAW BATTLEHughes said that in the service, ""it was instilled in me that I was there ‘to free a man to fight.’ Fighting for our country was what had to be done after Pearl Harbor.""Of our veterans and of the Veterans Day holiday every year, Hughes said, ""Veterans Day is one way to honor and pay respect to all who have served."" She added, ""I was so proud to be part of the Charlie Daniels Patriot Awards event. To know and understand the mission of The Journey Home Project is very important to me.""CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTERShe noted that ""events and organizations like this are necessary to assist our military brothers and sisters who are hurting and/or are in need.""She said, ""The one question we should ask ourselves is, ‘What can I do to help?’""Hughes was an award-winning speech and drama teacher in Louisiana when she retired at 65 — and became involved with Final Salute Inc.

Kids today don't see reverence for veterans. They're not being taught that. Instead, in our schools, we have LGBTQ, A, B, C, D, + month. I've lost track. Earth Day, of course, is public schools' highest of holy days. Al Gore, the high priest. Did your kids' school even hold a Veterans Day event today? Probably not. Of course, this all starts in the home and at church, but it should be reinforced in the school. Why do you think there's such a high turnout of young first-time voters for Democrats? Democrats like incoherent socialist John Fetterman. They've had teachers telling them America is racist, men can get pregnant and climate change is the biggest threat to the world ever. TOM COTTON CALLS OUT VOTE-COUNTING DELAYS IN ARIZONA, NEVADA: 'OUR NATION DESERVES BETTER'America's government school system is pumping out America hating-socialists who vote. Young people are being conditioned to see the world through the hard left's eyes. Don't ask any questions. Ignore crime, ignore the border — it's your fault. Let them cross. Free speech is for extremists. Don't pay off your loans that's for chumps. Don't like a word? Just change the meaning just a bit. You know, equality? Now it's equity. You don't like your gender? Get rid of it. Parents certainly stay out of that transition and now it takes a few weeks to count all the ballots.

Mark Finchem, who was endorsed by former President Donald Trump and has said he would not have certified President Biden's win in the state. Fontes, a former election official for Maricopa County, had called his opponent an election denier and ""January 6 insurrectionist"" because Finchem had attended the Jan. 6, 2021 Trump rally that preceded the riot at the U.S. Capitol.He campaigned on increasing transparency in the secretary of state's office and making voting easier for registered voters. The Associated Press called the race for Fontes Friday night.MIDTERM ELECTIONS 2022: LIVE UPDATES""I am honored to be presumptively elected Arizona's next Secretary of State. I will make it my mission to bring us closer together than we have been during these last few years,"" Fontes said in a statement.

 (Christian Petersen/Getty Images)""I promise to always honor and defend the ideal of fair and honest elections with the voters of Arizona and I will help reignite the flame of unity in our Republic,"" he said.  As secretary of state, Fontes will be in charge of overseeing elections and is responsible for certifying voting machines, election results, candidates and ballot measures. Additionally, the secretary of state is first in line to succeed the governor in the event of death resignation, or removal from office, functioning similarly to a lieutenant governor in other states. The race for governor in Arizona remains too close to call, with current Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs, a Democrat, leading her Republican opponent Kari Lake. Fox News called the statewide race for U.S. Senate Friday evening, projecting that incumbent Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., has won re-election against Republican challenger Blake Masters.Finchem and Masters were two of the most prominent Republicans to support Trump's unproven claims that the 2020 presidential election was fraudulent. Finchem had said there has been a ""decay of public confidence in our elections.""

 Facebook Twitter Instagram RSS Email OPINION Published November 12, 2022 7:00am EST Veteran suicides are a national crisis, but there are ways to help our heroes A fitness regimen is one tool to address the more than 6,000 veterans who die from suicide each year 
 By
 Eddie Gallagher , Jason Welch | Fox News Facebook Twitter Flipboard Comments Print Email close Video The cost of war: more than 30,000 veteran suicide deaths followed 9/11 Fox News chief national security correspondent Jennifer Griffin reports on the 30,177 veteran suicide The rate of suicidedeaths since back9/11 and the fallout from the US pulling out of Afghanistan.NEWYou can now listen to Fox News articles!
 This story discusses suicide. If you or someone you know is having thoughts of suicide, please contact the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline at 988 or 1-800-273-TALK (8255). This Veterans Day holiday brings with it an added focus on mental health. Sadly, many servicemen and women come back stateside to a lack of emotional and psychosocial support following their tours of service. However, one simple activity can help improve former soldiers' minds and psyches, even as it trains their bodies: Physical fitness. According to the most recent statistics, in 2020, a total of 6,146 veterans committed suicide — nearly 17 per day, and the 20th straight year with at least 6,000 veteran suicides. Veterans face a suicide rate more than 50% higher than those who have not served in the military, a mental burden that our nation's bravest men and women should not have to bear alone. The reasons for the epidemic of veteran suicides vary and explain the more significant problems plaguing many veterans' mental health. For example, in some branches, up to 31% of service members report symptoms of post-traumatic stress after combat and with most businesses not providing specific recruiting avenues for veterans or transition support, some former soldiers find it difficult to find jobs to pay their bills, and adapt to life in general, when returning to the private sector. VETERANS ARE ON THE FRONT LINES OF A US OPIOID CRISIS THAT CONTINUES TO WORSENFixing veterans' mental health difficulties will involve addressing these myriad and disparate causes. However, one simple step can help all veterans, regardless of their specific mental health needs: A physical fitness regimen.

The Mayo Clinic notes that exercise releases feel-good endorphins that improve well-being, while providing a positive outlet for individuals to focus on, instead of the worries that feed into mental anxiety. Just as important: Regular exercise helps enhance social interactions, whether as part of a sports team or just by being out and about in one's neighborhood. For returning soldiers, who can suffer from feelings of loneliness and isolation after leaving the military, camaraderie through organized exercise can provide critically important psychosocial bonds connecting veterans with others like them. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTERAs two individuals committed to helping military families, we recognize the way in which physical fitness can help to transform veterans' lives. Having seen his best friend lose his son in Afghanistan, Jason has cultivated veteran clients for his CrossFit business, knowing the link between physical fitness and mental wellness. Serving over 20 years in the special operations community as a SEAL brings with it a myriad number of stressors, and Eddie states that transition out is even more difficult. ""The reason I managed to do so well mentally and physically over eight combat deployments and be able to survive transition is all due to making fitness a priority in my life."" Of course, physical fitness alone will not solve all the problems faced by returning soldiers. Better access to mental health therapy, support from military and non-military organizations, and a sharper focus on the unique challenges veterans face will help alleviate the underlying causes of veterans' anxiety. But physical fitness brings with it many benefits and few drawbacks, making it a critical tool in the arsenal to improve mental health. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPTwo millennia ago, the Roman poet Juvenal coined the phrase mens sana in corpore sano — ""a healthy mind in a healthy body."" That phrase should guide our energies this Veterans Day, as we work to welcome our heroes home, and give them the support — both mental and physical — that they need to succeed in all their post-military endeavors.  Jason Welch is a fitness coach and owner of Crossfit Cadre in Hudson, Ohio.  Eddie Gallagher is the co-founder of the Pipe Hitter Foundation  (pipehitterfoundation.org) and a decorated combat veteran who served over 20 years in the United States Navy.

Mark Kelly fended off Republican challenger Blake Masters, Trump took to social media to blame McConnell over the loss. ""Mitch McConnell, the Republicans Broken Down Senate Leader, does nothing about this. He’s too busy spending vast amounts of money on bad Senator Lisa [Murkowski] of Alaska, when Kelly [Tshibaka] is FAR better.""

 Facebook Twitter Instagram RSS Email OPINION Published November 12, 2022 7:00am EST COP 27: Conference is underway and our liberal media has clamped down on any dissent from the climate cops Why do journalists covering the climate conference only entertain one point of view without any dissent? 
 By
 Tim Graham | Creators Syndicate Facebook Twitter Flipboard Comments Print Email close Video Biden stumbles over quote, draws laughs in COP27 speech President Biden stumbled while reading a quote during remarks at the COP27 UN climate summit Friday in Egypt.NEWYou can now listen to Fox News articles!
 The United Nations is one of the most sacred political cows in the liberal media. This is especially true when they convene the global elites on the perils of ""climate change."" The latest confab in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, began with the usual appeal to fear and panic from U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres, formerly known as the Socialist Party prime minister of Portugal.""Our planet is fast approaching tipping points that will make climate chaos irreversible,"" Guterres warned. ""We are on a highway to climate hell with our foot still on the accelerator."" If that AC/DC song echo wasn't strong enough, he added, ""It is either a climate solidarity pact, or a collective suicide pact.""Journalists consider anyone who questions this my-way-or-hell viewpoint as not only a ""denier"" of science but an enemy of the people. Their standard practice is to sound like U.N. publicists.COP27: DELEGATES WEIGH ‘CLIMATE COMPENSATION' FOR POOR NATIONS IMPACTED BY GLOBAL WARMINGNPR's comically titled newscast ""All Things Considered"" ran a U.N.-boosting story on Nov. 7 that they headlined ""U.N. climate conference opens with alarming warnings about the global climate."" There was no dissent allowed from the ""highway to climate hell"" talk.  
 Climate activists protest as President Biden delivers a speech at COP27 climate summit, in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, Nov. 11, 2022. 
 (REUTERS/Mohamed Abd El Ghany)Anchor Elissa Nadworny helpfully asked reporter Ruth Sherlock what the U.N. hoped to accomplish. Sherlock touted ""developing"" countries demanding ""loss and damage"" money, insisting ""wealthier countries that are responsible for most of the carbon dioxide emissions should pay reparations to emerging economies.""Conservatives are calling this the ""Sharm el-Sheikh-down.""The only dissenting note on NPR, naturally, was from the left of the U.N. establishment, from Greta Thunberg-style extremists who want to ban capitalism. Nadworny asked about Egypt hosting this conference, since they do not typically tolerate much dissent. COP27: THOUSANDS OF GLOBAL DIPLOMATS TO DESCEND UPON RITZY RESORT TOWN IN EGYPT TO SOLVE GLOBAL WARMINGNPR was proud to push the U.N. leader's warnings, but they didn't quote from this protester sign photographed in Egypt: ""Climate change denial deserves the death penalty."" Let's hope that's just one doomsday crank. But the authoritarians at the U.N. clearly need the doomsday sound because they want a climate crackdown more severe than the COVID shutdowns.  VideoIn 2021, the U.N. Environment Programme complained, ""Overall emissions reductions in 2020 likely reduced the annual increase of the atmospheric concentrations of long-lived greenhouse gases, but this effect was too small to be distinguished from natural variability."" Now they demand we reduce emissions by 45% by 2030. So imagine an ongoing crackdown worse than COVID shutdowns. You can't even debate the timing of their panic. The U.N. summit has a Climate Clock warning we only have six years and 253 days to avert certain doom. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTERDemocrats in the midterms slammed Republicans who question the climate doom as ""extremists."" The liberal media never questions whether the international climate consensus is extreme. They define that as the sensible governing center, with Greta Thunberg -- Time's 2019 Person of the Year -- goading for more. Authoritarian extremism is painted as idealism. Every democratic nation on Earth has to attempt to translate these demands into policy that doesn't cause a voter revolt. The result is a whole lot of verbal deference to globalist demands, followed by policies that ""fall short.""  VideoThe media yelled at Team Trump for pulling out of the Paris Agreement. What they wanted was an insincere endorsement of environmental extremism, and then a policy that was far less severe than what the U.N. wants.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPFor decades now, our so-called democracy-defending media has clamped down on any dissent from the climate cops. There can be no two sides -- or it's stacked as reason versus unreason, science versus quackdom and humanity versus inhumanity.When they complain the ""Biden agenda"" will be stopped, this is one crucial part of it. Democracy and climate are at odds.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM TIM GRAHAM Tim Graham is the Executive Editor of NewsBusters.org and co-author with Brent Bozell of ""Unmasked: Big Media’s War Against Trump.""

 FOX Bet Super 6 is a free-to-play contest. To get in the game for your chance at the $25,000 prize, download the FOX Bet Super 6 app, pick the winners and margins of victory of the six college football marquee matchups. Are there really only three more weeks left in the college football regular season? The season is flying faster than a Target sales associate replacing candy corn with mistletoe. Candy corn, by the way, deserves respect.Speaking of respect, the College Football Playoff (CFP) committee gave some to TCU in its latest rankings. The Horned Frogs finally moved up the board and are a part of the first four in. In a plot twist fit for an epic college football script, perennial favorites Alabama and Clemson both lost in Week 10. Now those two squads are on the outside looking in. While we're chuckling at the Tide and Tigers for losing their seat at the cool kids' table, we want you to know that you can sit with us because our table has money. And lots of it. But only if you play the game.We're talking about the FOX Bet Super 6 College Football Pick 6 challenge!FOX Bet Super 6 is a free-to-play contest. To get in the game for your chance at the $25,000 prize, download the FOX Bet Super 6 app, pick the winners and margins of victory of the six college football marquee matchups and submit your picks before the games kick off on Saturday.It's easy, it's free and people really do win! You could end your weekend $25,000 richer if you download the FOX Bet Super 6 app right now. But before you make your picks, read our predictions for the Week 11 marquee matchups.Shall we?Indiana at No. 2 Ohio State (Noon ET Saturday, FOX)One thing that we learned for certain last week is that it's never wise to underestimate the moxie of an underdog. In a contest where Northwestern — a team with one win all year — was a 38-point dog to the Buckeyes, the result was Ohio State 21, NU 7. And truthfully, the game felt closer than the final score. Can 40-point underdog Indiana keep it interesting this week against 9-0 Ohio State, too?That, friends, would be a resounding no. And that's not because the 3-6 Hoosiers are worse at football than the 1-8 Wildcats. It's because the Buckeyes have to play well enough moving forward to make us forget that dismal showing. That should be easy for them, especially because they own this series.Ohio State leads the series 76-12-5. As a matter of fact, the Hoosiers haven't defeated the Buckeyes since 1988. And when it comes to putting Week 10 behind them, QB C.J. Stroud's talent can easily bury that game. He has passed for 2,453 yards this year, and his 29 touchdowns rank second in college football.This Big Ten showdown at the Shoe will be all about the Buckeyes.Prediction:Ohio State by 21 to 26 pointsOklahoma at West Virginia (Noon ET Saturday, FS1)So far, so average for the Sooners in the post-Lincoln Riley era. OU is 5-4 under new head coach Brent Venables, and the team is sitting at seventh in the Big 12. We still like the Sooners over the Mountaineers this weekend.The Sooners get it done on both sides of the ball. Their 219.8 rushing yards per game lead the Big 12 and rank 12th in the country, and their 7.6 tackles for loss per game rank 10th in college football. Also, November has been good for Oklahoma. The squad has won 24 of its last 27 games in the month.On West Virginia's side, they've got journeyman quarterback JT Daniels. He's made more stops at colleges across the country than a career fair. JT's 2,042 passing yards rank 48th in the nation this season, and his eight interceptions are tied for 90th. So when the going gets tough this weekend, it's doubtful that Daniels will come to the rescue.Boomer!Prediction:Oklahoma by 7 to 8 pointsNo. 9 Alabama at No. 11 Ole Miss (3:30 p.m. ET Saturday, CBS)Down goes Bama — again? Yep, the Crimson Tide lost a second game of this regular season to LSU and proved that they are in fact mortal like the rest of us.And you know how the SEC's slogan is ""It just means more?"" Well, this all-SEC West matchup between Bama and Ole Miss is a game that could mean a lot.While LSU sits alone atop the west side of the conference, there are still some wacky long-shot scenarios that would allow the Tide or the Rebels to sneak into the top spot. Wacky being the operative word, here. But hey, stranger things have happened. With all that in mind, expect the Tide and the Rebels to bring their A-games. What do those A-games look like?Well, Bama's defense ranks fifth in the nation on third-down conversion rates. Ole Miss is second in the conference and ninth in the nation in converting third downs. Alabama's Bryce Young has passed for 2,234 and 19 TDs. And back to the Rebels — the seven sacks that they have allowed are the fourth fewest in FBS.Any way you slice it, both these teams come into this contest with impressive resumes and with impact players who can change the complexion of the game.But when it comes to being battle-tested, Bama has more players who've played in these high-stakes situations. Tide will roll.Prediction:Alabama by 9 to 11 pointsNo. 25 Washington at No. 6 Oregon (7 p.m. ET Saturday, FOX)This game will have all the offensive fireworks, so hold onto your seats.The Ducks have scored at least 41 points in every game this season. They put up 70 points in Week 2 against Eastern Washington. Coach Dan Lanning's offense — save for Week 1 against Georgia — is doing all the right things. But wait! The Huskies put up points, too. They've eclipsed 40 in six games this year. Points, points and more points. But somebody has to win. And we're going with Oregon.The Ducks rank first in FBS in first downs per game and first in touchdowns in the red zone. Their 520.6 yards per game rank second in the country. And then there's Bo Nix — the QB who's enjoying a second wind at the starting position after leaving Auburn. His 36 total touchdowns — 22 passing, 13 rushing and 1 receiving — lead all of FBS.While UW leads this series 60-48-5 and enters this matchup ranked second in the nation in first downs and third-down conversions, it's still the quack attack that we'll back.Oregon by a score.Prediction: Oregon by 7 to 8 pointsNo. 4 TCU at No. 18 Texas (7:30 p.m. ET Saturday, ABC)We're calling the upset. Texas will topple TCU in Week 11 of the college football season.And when we say upset, we mean an upset of TCU's clear path to a CFP berth. Because according to the oddsmakers at FOX Bet, Texas is a 7-point favorite.This prediction is as bold as a cowboy's oversized belt buckle. Go bold or go home, right?Here's what Texas has working in its favor. On offense, the Longhorns have wide receiver Xavier Worthy who ranks first in the Big 12 in TDs. They also have explosive running back Bijan Robinson, who has racked up 1,129 yards and 12 touchdowns this year. When it comes to the history between these two, Texas' record is 64-27-1. Honestly, TCU has had some pretty close calls. The pundits love to talk about TCU beating top 20 teams in four consecutive weeks. Okay, that's great, but let's also talk about how close some of their games have been. They beat Kansas by one score and Oklahoma State by a field goal.The luck of the Frog runs out this week against the Horns in Austin.Prediction: Texas by 7 to 8 pointsNo. 15 North Carolina at Wake Forest (7:30 p.m. ET Saturday, ESPN2)And while we're on the topic of non-upset upsets, here's another one for you. Wake Forest will beat North Carolina.Yes, FOX Bet has the Demon Deacons favored by 3.5 points, but Carolina has more to lose. The Tar Heels are 8-1 overall, a perfect 5-0 in conference play and first in the ACC. Wake Forest — 6-3 overall, 2-3 in the conference — is sixth in the ACC. To make it into the CFP, UNC would need a lot to go wrong for a handful of teams. However, they're still on course for a better bowl game than Wake. So the stakes are still somewhat high. But we give the Deacs the edge.Wake's QB Sam Hartman — with his 2423 passing yards and 24 TDs — has been an important leader as the captain of the Deacs ship. On defense, Wake Forest has Kobie Turner, a player with the highest rating of any Power Five defensive player in the country.Yes, North Carolina's QB Drake Maye is a real force, as he has passed for 2,964 yards this season, and his 31 touchdowns rank first in the nation. He's truly a gifted player who should be at the forefront of Heisman conversations. But we have to pick a team to win, and Wake is the better squad. All things considered, we like the Deacs to get the W at home.Prediction:Wake Forest by 5 to 6 pointsSo are you ready to play to win $25,000?Open your FOX Bet Super 6 app and make your selections before Saturday's games kick off.

 By
 Joe Morgan | Fox News Facebook Twitter Flipboard Comments Print Email close Video Fox News Flash top sports headlines for November 10 Fox News Flash top sports headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.Not all college football Saturdays are created equal. Then again, the Saturdays that appear to be prime for high-quality games often disappoint, which is why we play the games. Week 11 of the college football season does not have the eye-popping top-5 matchup or the storied in-state rivalry game. Still, games on the Week 11 schedule will go a long way in deciding the final four teams selected for the College Football Playoff at the end of the regular season.  FORMER ALABAMA QUARTERBACK CONCERNED ABOUT FUTURE OF PROGRAM UNDER NICK SABANLet’s look at a few games to be aware of Saturday as the college football season kicks off Week 11.Arkansas vs. No. 7 LSU - Noon ET, ESPNLSU is coming off its biggest win of the Brian Kelly era after defeating Alabama on a last-second two-point conversion in Week 10. The SEC Championship Game is in the Tigers' sights, but there are two more SEC teams to get through before a championship game berth can be a reality. The first comes Saturday when LSU heads to Fayetteville to take on an Arkansas team having a disappointing season.

 (John Korduner/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images)A win over the Razorbacks and an Ole Miss loss will lock up the SEC West for LSU, but a loss at Razorback Stadium ends the lofty goals that are within reach for the Tigers. CENTRAL MICHIGAN’S BERT EMANUEL JR. LIFTS CHIPPEWAS TO WIN WITH ELECTRIFYING TOUCHDOWNS RUNS, 293 YARDSArkansas is coming off a loss to Liberty in which the rushing attack was stymied, gaining just 144 yards. On the season, Arkansas owns the second-best rushing attack in the SEC and 10th in the country at 233.3 yards per game. Running back Raheim Sanders leads the SEC in rushing yards (1,101), and quarterback KJ Jefferson is a dual-threat QB, rushing for 425 yards and six touchdowns on the season.

 (Wesley Hitt/Getty Images)Backup quarterback Malik Hornsby is starting in place of Jefferson, who is dressed for the game but is reportedly dealing with a shoulder injury. The LSU defense is middle of the pack in the SEC when it comes to stopping the run, allowing 141.4 yards per game on the ground. ""Obviously playing a team that has a very prolific offense,"" Kelly said of Arkansas Monday, according to 247 Sports. ""And, in terms of players, it starts with their quarterback. I think it's the fifth time now we've seen a big physical quarterback. KJ Jefferson, 6-3, 240. He has 17 passing touchdowns and six rushing touchdowns. He is going to be a handful. Another guy that we've got to be able to control what he does and get him on the ground.""

 (Wesley Hitt/Getty Images)DABO SWEENEY THREATENS TO BENCH STARTING QB IF IT WILL IMPROVE CLEMSON’S OFFENSIVE WOESThe LSU rushing attack has gotten going in its three-game winning streak, rushing for an average of 204.0 yards per game since a loss to Tennessee Oct. 8. The Tigers have a chance to shake up the College Football Playoff picture if they’re able to run the table and find a way to beat Georgia, the likely representative from the SEC East, in the SEC Championship Game.But first, there’s Arkansas, an opponent that does present a ""trap game"" for Kelly and the Tigers. ""I guess. I mean, I guess that's what they call it,"" Kelly said when asked if Saturday’s game was a trap game for LSU. ""I've never bought into that because I think if it's a trap game, you have not done a very good job with your football team.""  No. 11 Ole Miss vs. No. 9 Alabama - 3:30 p.m. ET, CBSIt’s about as unfamiliar a position for Alabama as you’ll ever see. The Crimson Tide are essentially out of the running for a berth in the SEC Championship Game and the College Football Playoff after losing to LSU in Week 10. Alabama is hoping to avoid losing back-to-back regular season games for the first time since 2007 – Saban’s first year in Tuscaloosa – and their third regular season loss for the first time 2010.  
 Head coach Nick Saban of the Alabama Crimson Tide leaves the field after a game against the LSU Tigers at Tiger Stadium Nov 5, 2022, in Baton Rouge, La.
 (Jonathan Bachman/Getty Images)""I think it's a challenge for all of us to have pride,"" Saban said Monday, according to CBS Sports. ""We're gonna play a good team this week, and I'm sure they're gonna wanna put up on their mantle, 'We beat Alabama, too.' So it's just a matter of whether we're gonna allow that to happen or we're gonna go do everything we can to avoid it.""CFP TOP 25: TCU BREAKS INTO TOP FOUR, GEORGIA JUMPS TO NO.1Saban will look to avoid disaster against old friend Lane Kiffin. Kiffin has his Ole Miss Rebels ranked 11th in the CFP rankings and primed to beat Alabama for the first time since 2015. Kiffin, who coached under Saban from 2014-2016, reminded reporters Monday that Alabama easily could be undefeated and ranked No. 1 in the country.  
 Mississippi Rebels head coach Lane Kiffin looks on from the sideline during a game against the Texas A and M Aggies at Kyle Field Oct. 29, 2022, in College Station, Texas. 
 (Ken Murray/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images)""They’ve lost two games by two plays. Both games could have went either way,"" Kiffin said, according to AL.com. ""Alabama makes the field goal at Tennessee and the [LSU] two-point [conversion] gets stopped, and they’re the No. 1, No. 2 team in the country coming in here.

""They've got really good running plays, but they're running those same plays out of all those different multiples, which is trying to put different players in different positions. So, you make a mistake, you have a gap open, and they hit a play on you.""No. 6 Oregon vs. No. 25 Washington - 7 p.m. ET, FOXAfter one week of the regular season, no one would have thought that Dan Lanning would have his Oregon Ducks in prime position for the CFP with just three conference games to go. But Oregon has rolled since its 49-3 beat down at the hands of Georgia on opening weekend, winning eight straight. The Ducks welcome Washington to Eugene, where Oregon has won 23 straight games at Autzen Stadium, good for the third-longest home winning streak in the nation.

He’s added 457 yards on the ground with 13 touchdowns. It’s been a balanced attack for Oregon, second in the Pac-12 in rushing yards per game (231.2) and fourth in the conference in passing yards (289.3). ""Obviously coming on from Game 1 wasn't the result we wanted,"" Lanning said of how the schedule has shaken out, according to ESPN.

 By
 Joseph A. Wulfsohn | Fox News Facebook Twitter Flipboard Comments Print Email close Video 'Watch Me': President Joe Biden responds to questions about a 2024 campaign President Joe Biden responds to questions about a presidential campaign in 2024, despite many voters saying they don't want him to run again. ""Real Time"" host Bill Maher drew attention to the Democratic obsession with identity politics, specifically pertaining to who they will nominate in 2024.During his interview on Friday with Democratic Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, Maher asked whether the country is ""over the gay hump"" with his successful re-election bid as America's first openly gay governor and the election of two lesbian governors in Oregon and Massachusetts. Polis credited the voters who say ""it doesn't matter"" who they are but instead care what they stand for.""Do you think, when you run for president, it actually could be an advantage?"" Maher asked as Polis shook his head in reaction to the presidential buzz. ""Because the Democratic Party is very big on checking boxes. And it's very hard to imagine any ticket now on the Democratic side that would have just two straight, White men. It's impossible to imagine. So they need to check boxes. You check one of them.""BILL MAHER CALLS DESANTIS ‘POWERFUL,' RIPS ‘LOSER’ TRUMP: ‘HOW MANY ELECTIONS HAS HE NOW F’ED UP IN GEORGIA?'""First of all, I have the job I love,"" Polis responded. ""I'm really passionate about Colorado, I hope everybody visits Colorado, enjoys Colorado…""""So you'll never run for president,"" Maher interjected. ""I love this job that I have, it's the job I want,"" Polis replied, sparking chuckles from the audience for his non-answer.

 (AP Photo/David Zalubowski, File)Polis added, ""It's not a bad thing that the Democratic Party wants to look like America. I mean, I think it is good that you have a party, you know, on race, on gender on all these different on faith, on all these different factors. I mean, you want to look like America. People should be able to look themselves in the mirror and say, 'Hey, there's somebody like me in Congress or somebody like me on the Supreme Court.' That's a good thing.""""It is a good thing. But the question, though, is it the priority?"" Maher asked. ""I think that's what people hesitate sometimes about the Democrats. Is it more of a priority than things like merit that should matter more? Is it more of a priority than facts or science?"" BILL MAHER SAYS DEMOCRACY WILL ‘LOSE’ IN MIDTERMS: ELECTING ‘ELECTION DENIERS’ WILL LEAD TO ‘AUTHORITARIANISM’""It never should stand in the way of merit, right? You always want the best president, the best member of Congress,"" Polis responded. ""But what I think it's exciting, at least where the Democrats are, and I think most Americans are is these things don't matter. I mean, at look at President Barack Obama, right, first African American president of the United States of America.… These barriers that are in people's minds still, like somehow I can't do this, I think these are falling away, and there really is no barrier for anybody with any background and matter their race who they are who they love their faith or no faith at all. There's really no, no impediment there to serve in any office.""Later during the panel discussion, Maher revived the topic with his guest, Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., who has been floated as a potential 2024 hopeful if President Biden does not seek re-election. Fellow panelist, CBS News correspondent Robert Costa predicted both Polis and Khanna will run as long as the president doesn't. ""And it's perfect because no straight White guys. The last thing you want is a straight White guy. Sorry Gavin Newsom!"" Maher laughed.BILL MAHER MARVELS AT GOP POPULARITY AMONG HISPANIC VOTERS: DEMOCRATS' ‘PANDERING’ HASN'T WORKED""I will say this … I don't think it should matter,"" Khanna responded. ""I don't think it should matter whether someone's Indian-American, gay, straight. I think what should matter is what is your vision for this country… That's the only thing that should matter whether someone's White, straight, gay. Indian, whatever. It should absolutely no bearing.""""It shouldn't, but it will,"" Maher pushed back. ""Look, I have no dog in this fight. I'm not running for president. I don't care if it's two White men or two f---in' purple people! I'm just saying the Democratic Party, where they are with identity politics, they will never have two straight White guys. And maybe they shouldn't. I'm just saying that's a fact. That just can't be. So you got to … check one of the boxes. Luckily, you do.""

 By
 Fox News Staff | Fox News Facebook Twitter Flipboard Comments Print Email close Video China ramps up efforts to increase agriculture production Fox News host Bret Baier analyzes China's ambitions for agriculture dominance as it competes with the U.S. on Wednesday's 'Special Report.' BEIJING - China’s low birthrate problems have been further complicated by the high prices demanded for traditional dowries by the families of potential brides. Chinese social media platforms were recently aghast at the price one groom’s family was asked to pay, even leading to the story being censored by authorities.The engaged couple in question saw their brief engagement collapse after the bride’s family demanded $163,000 for the privilege of marrying their daughter. Due to their lack of financial resources, the couple was forced to break up. ""I always thought that excessive bride prices were stories that only existed on the internet until it happened to my own family"" read the opening line in what was one of the most popular articles on the site. The writer’s cousin fell in love with a woman from Jiangxi province.

 (REUTERS/Tingshu Wang)The dowry tradition of giving gifts to the family of the bride has existed for hundreds of years in China, and although a 1950 law prohibited forced marriages and any form of property-asking, the custom has largely remained in place. China's substantial demographic imbalance has been one cause that costs have swelled. The communist nation ended its one-child policy in 2015 and has since resulted in a surplus of an estimated 34 million men, as many families preferred to have a son over a daughter. In many areas, the average bride price can easily be five times the average annual disposable income, and the financial pressures have led it to become a problem facing the Chinese authoritiesCHINA'S POPULATION EXPECTED TO DIP AHEAD OF 2025: OFFICIALWith a population of around 1.4 billion people, China continues to be the world’s most populous nation. However, with birth rates in decline for years, it is estimated to hit a record low this year dropping below 10 million from last year's 10.6 million births. Additionally, China's fertility rate of 1:16 in 2021 was below the 2:1 OECD standard for a stable population.  
 A groom lifts a cloth covering his bride's face during their traditional Chinese wedding ceremony in Beijing May 15, 2004. Some young people in China are going back to their roots for more traditional weddings, and turning away from Western-style ceremonies that had gained popularity.
 (REUTERS/Wilson Chu WC)To combat the low growth rates, Chinese authorities have recently introduced numerous measures to encourage couples to have more children, including extended maternity leave and other financial incentives. Beijing also installed a 30-day cooling-off period for couples wanting to divorce. Nonetheless, the willingness to have more children is among the lowest worldwide. According to the Chinese government, excessive bride prices are yet another obstacle for young people to start having a family.Recently, local authorities have implemented numerous rules to curb excessive bride prices. In September, national authorities also decided to step in when it announced a nationwide trial campaign to ""promote a series of standards"" and strict regulation on ""vulgar standards."" The campaign will last until the end the year.  CHINA SEES SPIKE IN COVID-19 CASES 
 An expectant mother Li Zhao, 35, chooses baby products at a shop in Beijing Oct. 30, 2015. Li Zhao, an office worker who is six month pregnant, said one-child policy was cruel because having baby is basic civil right. However, she does not want to have second baby for her personal reason. China has unwound its one-child policy, for decades a symbol of invasive and coercive government planning, but the shift has been met with a disinterested shrug from many younger couples.
 (REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon)Reuters recently reported that China's National Health Commission said COVID-19 has also contributed to the decline in the country's marriage and birth rates. The Reuters report continued that demographers have also said that China's uncompromising ""zero-COVID"" policy of promptly stamping out any outbreaks with strict controls on people's lives may have caused profound, lasting damage on their desire to have children.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPReuters contributed to this report.

 Facebook Twitter Instagram RSS Email Fox News Flash Published November 12, 2022 1:41am EST TUCKER CARLSON: The most powerful people in the world are always telling you they're victims Tucker reacts to a noose allegedly being discovered outside Obama presidential library site 
 By
 Tucker Carlson | Fox News Facebook Twitter Flipboard Comments Print Email close Video Tucker Carlson: Construction of Obama's temple was halted Fox News host Tucker Carlson reacts to a noose being found around the construction of former President Obama's presidential library on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'NEWYou can now listen to Fox News articles!
 The concept of a presidential library, a shrine to a former president, is a relatively new idea. For the first 150 years of this country's existence, presidents didn't have lavish monuments built to commemorate their rule. The whole notion would have repulsed the men who waged a war with a monarchy to build this country, but starting with FDR, of course, presidential libraries became customary and they've gradually transformed from that — from libraries — into multimillion dollar temples to hubris.  The most recent ex-president to get his very own temple and the biggest of all, of course, is Barack Obama. The total cost of his library clocks in at about half a billion dollars. Construction began last year when Obama demanded that his donors pay for it, but today, construction of the temple was halted because of an emergency. No, not a fire, not a lightning strike. According to the construction company working on the library: ""This morning, we were informed that an act of hate was discovered at the project site,"" and you knew the act of hate was serious because the media went all in. They devoted a lot of time to talking about this — on the brink of nuclear war and recession, but the act of hate on the Obama construction site led the news. ARIZONA RANCHER: AFTER MS-13 WALKED THROUGH THE GAP IN THE BORDER WALL, THEY CAME KNOCKING AT MY DOOR

 (AP )DON LEMON: Construction at the Obama Presidential Center in Chicago is suspended after a noose was discovered at the site on Thursday.  CBS ANCHOR: An act of hate. A noose is found at the site of the Obama presidential center.  CNN REPORTER: A noose was found at the site. Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker condemning the hateful act. NORAH O’DONNELL, CBS: An ugly, racist symbol was found at the future site of the Obama presidential center. A noose was discovered at the construction site this morning. Operations were halted and the police were called. A $100,000 reward has been offered for information leading to those responsible for what officials described as this shameless act of cowardice and hate.  REPUBLICANS SPLIT ON TRUMP'S EFFECT ON LACKLUSTER MIDTERMS AS CONTROL OF CONGRESS HANGS IN BALANCE A lot of huffing and puffing. Have you heard a story like this before? Well, it wasn't that long ago in the middle of a national crime wave, which it has done very little to solve, the FBI rushed a team of agents to a NASCAR garage after a character called Bubba Wallace suggested that a noose had been left in that garage. Turns out the noose was a garage door pole. Here's the interesting thing: Everyone makes mistakes, but mistakes like this never get corrected. Nobody ever apologized for that — not the media, not the FBI, and certainly not Bubba Wallace. In fact, Bubba Wallace said that only stupid people would doubt his story even after it was proven to be false. QUESTION: What would you say to those people who are doubting that this even happened or that it's true?  BUBBA WALLACE: Yeah, just like Steve Phelps said, it offends me that people would go to those measures, but again, I'm not shocked. Simple-minded people like that, the ones that are afraid of change, they use everything in their power to defend what they stand up for and instead of trying to listen and understand. What? You alleged a crime. Hard to say that's a crime, but whatever, worthy of the attention of the FBI, this is all insane, but you were wrong. Instead of apologizing, you're lecturing people like they're your moral inferiors for asking questions and it was obvious from the beginning that Bubba Wallace's story made no sense. We're not saying he was making it up, but he was wrong, and there is a high likelihood that this noose at Barack Obama's temple might be a hoax, too.  FATHER OF MISSING MARYLAND KIDS 'CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC' MOM CATHERINE HOGGLE WILL BE COMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL  VideoA lot of these stories are. Why do they keep appearing? We'll tell you why — because accusations of hate crimes and bias more generally, are tools that the people in power use, not the powerless, the powerful, to ward themselves greater and totally unearned moral authority over everybody else.  Barack Obama is the perfect example. Oppressed, really? Obama is a half-White guy with an Ivy League degree and served as president of the United States for two terms and lives in two oceanfront compounds in the richest zip codes in the world. Does that sound like oppression? No, it sounds like privilege. That's fine, but no, they tell you he's Emmett Till. He's a powerless victim of your racism. So, when you make allegations like that, nobody gets to ask the obvious questions like, where did you get all this money? Like, how are you making a living? How did you get so rich? What have you been selling in exchange for that money and by the way, why are you spending a half a billion dollars on a presidential library? You don't get to ask those questions because all you know is that somebody left a noose at a construction site because this is an immoral, racist country. All the people below me are bad people. People at the top are good people. The bad people in the bottom are creating a country full of racism that's so pervasive and scary that we have to pause construction on the temple just to catch our breath. Obama's told us many times before this is a bad country. He told us for eight years.  ON VETERANS DAY, NEW YORK TEEN HONORS WWII VETERAN WITH MEMORIAL AND PERSONALIZED CREATIONS OBAMA: He knew from his own life that progress is fragile, that we have to be vigilant against the darker currents of this country's history, of our own history, but there are whirlpools of violence and hatred and despair that can always rise again. Bull Connor may be gone, but today we witness with our own eyes police officers kneeling on the necks of Black Americans. ""Bull Connor might be gone, but you still exist and you're oppressing everybody else, so we're going to have to oppress you."" This latest offense against one of the world's most powerful men is so appalling that the authorities have offered a $100,000 reward to anyone who can find the person who left a noose at Obama's presidential library. $100,000 because we victimized Barack Obama yet again and his wife. What's interesting is, for perspective, is that there's no $100,000 reward outstanding for the, say, thousands of unsolved murders in this country and that's a lot of murders.  In fact, roughly half the murders that occur in the United States are now never solved because they're not becoming third worlds or anything. Thomas Hargrove, who runs the Murder Accountability Project, put it this way very crisply: ""It's a 50/50 coin-flip. It's never been this bad. During the last seven months of 2020, most murders went unsolved. That's never happened before in America."" Now, why is that happening? Because nobody cares. That's why and where are these murders happening? Oh, in Obama's fake hometown of Chicago. A lot of them.  ARIZONA DEMOCRAT REP. SUSIE LEE WINS RE-ELECTION IN NEVADA'S 3RD CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT  
 Former U.S. President Barack Obama speaks about the Affordable Care Act and lowering health care costs for families during an event in the East Room of the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., on Tuesday, April 5, 2022. 
 (Photographer: Al Drago/Bloomberg via Getty Images)MIKE TOBIN: That mass shooting that we were just talking about is in Chicago, was in the troubled west side of town where the bloodshed is frequent. It happened about 9:30 p.m. local time. People had gathered for a vigil. Police say it was an SUV that pulled up. Two gunmen opened fire and sprayed bullets into the crowd. The whole thing was over in about three seconds. Fourteen people were injured. Witnesses say one man was shot in the head and one person was hit by a car in the chaos, but among the victims are a 3-year-old, an 11-year-old and a 13-year-old boy. The rest of the victims are said to be adults. OK. Does anyone care? No. Nobody in power cares, not at all about any of these crimes, actual crimes. In Nevada, an illegal alien called Carlos Nava, who has been deported seven times, but is still here because the Democratic Party wants his vote, is now facing charges that he raped five people in this country over nearly 20 years. Five people were raped. Did anyone ever offer $100,000 for his arrest or to give to his victims? But we've got $100,000 to spare for whoever tied that piece of string in a forbidden shape of Barack Obama's construction site. Really?  Again, if all the moral outrage were directed on behalf of people with no power who are actually suffering (and there are millions of them in America), you could kind of put up with it, but all this huffing and puffing over Barack and Michelle Obama? Most people don't see them as a color. They see them for what they are, which is the most privileged people in the world and yet Michelle Obama just wrote a whole book about her struggle to ""stay visible in a world that doesn't necessarily see a tall, Black woman."" What? You don't see Michelle Obama? She was the president's wife for eight years. How much money has Michelle Obama made in the last six years? Oh, you'd love to know, but you're supposed to just accept it uncritically, just like you're supposed to believe the Jussie Smollett hoax. GINGRICH CALLS FOR POSTMORTEM REVIEW OF MIDTERMS, LAUDS GOP FOR REPORTEDLY WINNING POPULAR VOTE ALI VELSHI: We've got some breaking news. Actor and musician Jussie Smollett from the hit show ""Empire"" was attacked and beaten early this morning in Chicago and police say it could be a hate crime. MIGUEL ALMAGUER: There are many indications of a hate crime here. They are looking for two suspects who were apparently wearing ""Make America Great Again"" hats. ELLIOT PAGE: We have a media that's saying it's a debate whether or not what just happened to Jussie Smollett is a hate crime. It's absurd.  MICHAELA ANGELA DAVIS, WRITER: You know, Jussie Smollett had a noose on his neck just this week.  SARAH GILBERT: And the media has really cast so much doubt on his story, which I find so personally offensive that a gay Black man is targeted and then suddenly he becomes the victim of people's disbelief.  BROOKE BALDWIN: He said his attackers hurled racial and homophobic slurs at him and this is America in 2019. AIR FORCE VETERAN AND HIS WIFE FACED PTSD HEAD-ON WITH THE HELP OF ALL SECURE FOUNDATION  VideoThis is America in 2019, where the most powerful people are the most frequently victimized and that really is the message is the people in charge, people with power over your life, the people who make the laws, the people who shape your culture, in some cases, people who can put you in jail, certainly, people are paid a lot more than you are. They're the real victims. They're the real victims. So, what are we watching? We're watching a power play, of course.  We're watching a transfer of moral authority from the population, a nation of citizens, to the top 1% and as the recession deepens and people get poorer, you're going to see a lot more of this. ""Don't notice my looting. I'm the victim."" That's why Hillary Clinton plays the sexism card. ""Don't ask questions. I'm a woman.""CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  
 Hillary Clinton at Venice Film Festival 
 (Andreas Rentz)CLINTON: So, any of you who've read my book about what happened know that I think that misogyny and sexism was part of that campaign. It was one of the contributing factors and some of it was old-fashioned sexism and a refusal to accept the equality of women and certainly the equality of women's leadership.  Yeah, they all do it. Chelsea Clinton does it. Nancy Pelosi does it, Ocasio-Cortez does it. Kamala Harris does it. The most powerful people in the world are always telling you they're victims. Joe Biden can't do it, of course, because he's a White man so instead, he accuses you of transphobia, thereby keeping the balance of moral authority on his side of the scale.

""National stability and security in many aspects depends on international stability and security.""The U.S. has been one of the chief supporters to Kyiv since Russia invaded in February and has provided $19 billion in security assistance since January 2021, more than $18 billion of which was provided since the February invasion.While Washington’s support for Ukraine has largely been bipartisan, House Republicans brought the issue into question ahead of the U.S. midterms when Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., said the GOP would not write a ""blank check"" to Kyiv if it won control over the lower chamber.Similarly, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., said last week that ""under Republicans, not another penny will go to Ukraine"" if the GOP wins the House. ""Our country comes first,"" she added.

There are still 32 seats that have yet to be called in the House. In his interview with Fox News Digital, Vasiuk urged lawmakers on both sides of the aisle to remember they, along with their Ukrainian allies, ""share common values that are based on democracy,"" particularly in the face of Russian aggression.Vasiuk said he is not concerned by which party has control in Congress, and noted he already has plans to travel to Washington in December to meet with Democratic and Republican lawmakers.The Ukrainian parliamentarian plans to discuss expanding ""bilateral cooperation"" when it comes to economic, energy, security and humanitarian concerns, among other issues.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.Authorities did not discover any substance in the ""suspicious"" items mailed to Arizona GOP gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake's campaign headquarters.This comes after Lake's campaign alleged last week that a staffer was exposed to a ""suspicious"" white powdery substance sent in an envelope to her office. The staffer also found two additional envelopes with a resemblance to the first. One of the three envelopes in question was disposed of before authorities arrived to investigate. Phoenix Police said Friday that an investigation and laboratory test confirmed there was no substance in the two remaining envelopes.""The state lab tested the items turned over to them regarding incident #2022-1665892 and has determined there was no substance inside,"" police said.KARI LAKE ON CAMPAIGN HQ RECEIVING ‘SUSPICIOUS’ ITEMS IN THE MAIL: ‘WE’RE IN DANGEROUS TIMES' 
 Law enforcement did not discover any substance in the ""suspicious"" items mailed to Arizona GOP gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake's campaign headquarters.
 (AP Photo/LM Otero, File)Police responded at around 10:15 p.m. local time on November 5 to a call at an office building near 40th Street and Camelback about ""suspicious"" mail.The day before, a volunteer had opened an envelope allegedly containing a vulgar letter and a white powdery substance, Lake's campaign told FOX News Digital. The volunteer had said the substance looked like baking flour. The substance and letter were thrown in the trash by the volunteer, and the cleaning crew disposed of the trash before police arrived at the scene the following day.Two more pieces of mail resembling the first letter were also discovered by the same volunteer. The campaign's head of security, Scott Masino, was not notified of the letters until late at night on November 5.Masino then went to the office and examined the letters. He told the police the letters were unopened and the seals were intact, but that he felt a powdery substance inside.ARIZONA CANDIDATE KARI LAKE CAMPAIGN HQ RECEIVES ‘SUSPICIOUS ITEMS’ IN MAIL, PROMPTING PHOENIX POLICE RESPONSE 
 Phoenix Police said Friday that an investigation and laboratory test confirmed there was no substance in the envelope.
 (AP Photo/Matt York)""Last week, our campaign received three letters with no return addresses,"" Masino said in a statement to FOX News Digital. ""The first, which was opened by a campaign staffer last Friday, contained a white powdery substance along with a hateful letter. The staffer immediately threw the contents away. The staffer was unfamiliar with the protocol for security situations and did not notify senior staff until the next day, upon which I took the lead as head of security and immediately notified the Phoenix police department.""Specialized law enforcement units then responded to the scene and sealed the envelopes in separate bags, which were sent to the State Public Health Laboratory.""Phoenix PD arrived on scene,"" Masino said. ""By that point, the office trash had already been emptied. Nevertheless, given the contents of the first letter, the Phoenix PD decided to treat this case as a suspicious substance incident. Phoenix PD made the decision to bring in the bomb squad and FBI, and sent the remaining two letters to the lab to be examined. We have since learned that those two remaining letters had no substances inside as the first did.""The laboratory analysis found no powder and no harmful substance in either of the envelopes. The two letters did, however, include derogatory and vulgar language.Phoenix Police did not respond to FOX News Digital's request for comment. 
 Officers had responded on November 6 to a ""found property call at an office building"" near 40th Street and Camelback.

 (REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson)He said in the conversation Monday that liberal policies on education affected his children's learning.""They came home very confused about whether or not the United States was a good country,"" Griffin said. ""And they came home confused about what they could or couldn’t say to a student who was Asian or otherwise of color.""""My son was reprimanded for telling an Asian student he was good at math — for stereotyping,"" he continued.

That says something, that says something, and I think it's a significant takeaway,"" Hostin said.She also praised voter turnout during Thursday's episode of ""The View"" despite claiming there was ""tremendous"" voter suppression on Wednesday. Behar, who argued on Wednesday that it should have been a ""blue tsunami,"" said Thursday that she didn't want to be a ""Debbie Downer"" but echoed her previous remarks and said Democrats should have a ""supermajority"" in Congress. ""On the one had you have a party that tried to save health care, that tries to save your right to vote, that tries to preserve a woman's right, that tries to save a planet, and we still don't have a supermajority?

It's abortion rights, stupid! It's voting rights, stupid!""Hostin praised the president again during Thursday's episode and said she was glad he didn't talk about crime, inflation or immigration before the election. ""Those are Republican talking points. He had his finger on the pulse of what the everyday American needed, and he explained that our democracy was at stake and if you look at the exit polls, the two biggest issues — number one, saving our democracy and number two, women's health care rights,"" she said.  Hanna Panreck is an associate editor at Fox News.

 Fox News Staff | Fox News Facebook Twitter Flipboard Comments Print Email close Video Angle: Wrong Lessons Laura Ingraham discusses how establishment Republicans want to kill off the populist movement on ‘The Ingraham Angle.’Laura Ingraham discusses the implications midterms had on populism after Republican results Friday on ""The Ingraham Angle,"" saying it was ""predictable.""LAURA INGRAHAM: Now, it was predictable. The GOP establishment, which has been losing elections since about 2006, would declare the Republicans' disappointing midterms showing the death knell for populism. Now, the rationale being that because certain Trump-backed candidates lost in key races, the entire populist movement lost, too. LAURA INGRAHAM: THESE ‘OBSCENE’ ELECTION DELAYS ARE HAVING REAL-WORLD IMPLICATIONS 
 Conservatives rushed to Twitter on Tuesday to spike the football when GOP Gov. Ron DeSantis was projected to defeat Charlie Crist to secure another term as Florida’s chief executive. 
 (James Gilbert/Getty Images)…Well, David Brooks, the liberals' favorite liberal masquerading as something more sophisticated, likened it all to a fever finally breaking. ""Performative populism has begun to ebb,"" he wrote. ""And Trump's nihilistic violence that lay at the heart of it all."" Writing in The New York Times, Matthew Continetti struck a similar note, arguing that Tuesday's results bear a striking resemblance to the midterm elections of 1998, when setback then led to renewal, when the party then went on to embrace Texas Gov. George W. Bush, who had won re-election, of course, in 1998, in Texas. Now word to the wise: If you're actually trying to help Ron DeSantis in 2024, best not to make a comparison to the president who hasn't been invited to speak at any RNC convention since he left office.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP This article was written by Fox News staff.

 By
 Joseph A. Wulfsohn | Fox News Facebook Twitter Flipboard Comments Print Email close Video Trump goes after 'Ron DeSanctimonious' again after Florida governor's re-election Fox News’ Kevin Corke reports on the battle for control of Congress with key races in Arizona, Nevada and Georgia still too close to call and discusses former President Trump taking a dig at Gov. Ron DeSantis.""Real Time"" host Bill Maher had some fun at the expense of former President Donald Trump while drawing attention to the political rise of Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. Maher was in good spirits on Friday after predicting last week that democracy would ""lose"" in the midterm elections, pointing out how ""unprecedented"" it is that the party in power has lost few to no House seats, noting the only other exception in recent years was in the 2002 midterms following 9/11.""So basically Trump is as scary as 9/11 to people, that's really the message — I think that's the takeaway,"" Maher said during a panel discussion. BILL MAHER SAYS DEMOCRACY WILL ‘LOSE’ IN MIDTERMS: ELECTING ‘ELECTION DENIERS’ WILL LEAD TO ‘AUTHORITARIANISM’While talking about the GOP-infighting that has taken place since the midterms where some in the party have blamed Trump for endorsing candidates that resulted in various defeats, Maher wasn't ready to cheer that ""the Wicked Witch is dead"" since he's seen ""Jason come back from the grave too many times,"" though he did say ""it does seem closer than ever"" that Republicans will abandon the former president. ""Time. Time is such a great ally when the enemy is something that exhausts you. He's exhausting. And now it's like election after election after — it's finally, finally, maybe,"" Maher said. 
 ""Real Time"" host Bill Maher
 (HBO)CBS News correspondent Robert Costa wondered ""who"" within the Republican Party would take on Trump, who many expect will launch his 2024 campaign next week, suggesting someone as young as DeSantis would not want to ""risk"" his career getting in the mud with him. ""Risk? Why is that a risk?"" Maher asked. ""He goes after you personally, he goes after your family — a lot of people don't want to get into the arena and get bloodied up,"" Costa responded. Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., piled on DeSantis, suggesting he's gone further than Trump in attacking the First Amendment, pointing to his ""bullying"" of Disney and claiming Florida's new abortion law is too extreme. BILL MAHER MARVELS AT GOP POPULARITY AMONG HISPANIC VOTERS: DEMOCRATS' ‘PANDERING’ HASN'T WORKED""I think one reason he did well in Florida because didn't he have a 15-week rule, which is similar to what they have in Europe? I don't — he did not go as far,"" Maher said. ""He's not been clear,"" Khanna told Maher. ""He's not been clear whether he opposes an abortion national ban, does he oppose what Lindsey Graham said."" ""Well, he certainly didn't do what a lot of very conservative people did in conservative states which would say, this is like… moment of conception,"" Maher defended DeSantis. ""I mean, I understand what you're saying about DeSantis. The reason why I think DeSantis is so strong is because he can do both things. He can do the performance art, that seems to have you so exercised, to the base, most of which I don't really know if it's that damaging — he picks a fight with Disney, does it really affect anybody?""  
 Conservatives rushed to Twitter on Tuesday to spike the football when GOP Gov. Ron DeSantis was projected to defeat Charlie Crist to secure another term as Florida’s chief executive. 
 (James Gilbert/Getty Images)""I mean, I read the 'Don't Say Gay,' which is not the name of the law. They call it the ‘Don’t Say Gay' law. It could have been called the 'Let's Do Things in Schools the Way We Did Five Years Ago' law,"" Maher continued. So what I'm saying is, he can do both that… yes, he knows how to rile up the base. I agree. He's a politician, but he also can be a normal governor. In other words, after the storm, he can stand with President Biden like a normal governor does and work with him and then send some migrants to Martha's Vineyard. And that's a very powerful thing, to have both those elements.""BILL MAHER: THE PAUL PELOSI ATTACK IS LATEST IN THE ‘COLD CIVIL WAR’Khanna continued attacking DeSantis, accusing him of having ""no economic vision"" or ""foreign policy vision,"" which received pushback from Maher. ""He's a governor — what's a governor's foreign policy positions supposed to be?… It's Florida. Florida is not in the U.N.! Jesus Christ,"" Maher exclaimed.  
 Former President Donald Trump speaks to supporters at a rally to support local candidates on Sept. 3, 2022 in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. 
 (Spencer Platt/Getty Images)The HBO star later circled back to whether Republicans will dump Trump, invoking the former president's famous campaign promise of ""You're gonna be so tired of winning.""""No, we're tired of losing. You're a loser and you keep losing,"" Maher told the former president. ""I mean Georgia — how many elections has he now f----- up in Georgia?… Not since Sherman has anyone caused this amount of damage in Georgia than he has caused to the Republican Party.""""It's funny, the deniers didn't do well and the defiers did well… Brian Kemp defied him,"" Maher added.CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APPLater on, while discussing how Biden should sit out of 2024, Maher said the president would ""definitely beat Trump again"" wasn't so certain about DeSantis.""It's gonna look weird because he will be, like, literally twice as old as him… and DeSantis has, like, three little kids. You know, that always plays well in America. America likes new. It likes strange. We want some strange."" He then said to Costa, ""You said DeSantis shouldn't run. DeSantis should run now and quickly. This is the problem Chris Christie had.""""Yeah, he could have run in 2011, 2012,"" Costa said about the former New Jersey governor. ""Sometimes in politics, you have one chance.""""The longer you stay at the fair, the more you get beat up,"" Maher said. When Obama ran, they said, ""‘He has no record,' and he went, ‘Good, great, I’m glad I have no record because people don't give a s--- about me not having a record.'""  Joseph A.

 Maria Lencki | Fox News Facebook Twitter Flipboard Comments Print Email close Video Former Islamic extremist Maajid Nawaz on how ideas direct finance Tucker Carlson previews his 'Tucker Carlson Today' interview with political activist Maajid Nawaz about extremism in America.Reformed radical turned counter-extremism activist Maajid Nawaz is opening up about how he saw tortured Islamist prisoners turn violent after enduring horrific abuse and explains the importance of having a government that defends human rights on ""Tucker Carlson Today."" As a young man in the United Kingdom, Nawaz witnessed unspeakable violence that inspired him to seek out a sense of belonging and protection in Hizb ut-Tahrir, an Islamist organization that sought to impose a caliphate over the world.  His ideas and organization participation, though not violent, led him on a journey to recruit others. He arrived in Egypt a day before the 9/11 attacks where he studied Arabic and set up group chapters. After a government clampdown, his house was raided and at 24-years-old in Egypt, he was jailed for his thoughts. What he witnessed changed his life. ""To get to that prison, you first have to go through the torture dungeon,"" he said. ""...We were tied with rags around our eyes and our hands, and my number was 42...What they would do in that underground torture dungeon is they’d go through a roll call … Number one is called. The guard leads him off to the torture facility and everyone else hears the screams of number one..."" UN GENERAL ASSEMBLY ADOPTS RESOLUTION ACCUSING TALIBAN OF HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS IN AFGHANISTAN Nawaz, who was forced to watch his friend be tortured after Nawaz only answered for his name and organization, detailed how officials electrocuted prisoners’ teeth and genitalia, among other horrific practices. His charge was ""propagation by speech and writing for a banned organization."" In Egypt, all organizations were banned because you needed a permit to operate and suspension of the country’s constitution allowed people to be tried for their beliefs.  ""We were put into solitary confinement for four months in cells that had no bed, no toilet, no sanitation (with) 15 minutes break a day,"" he shared. ""The toilet was the floor.""  Many prisoners who he met had been in jail without charge for as long as he had been alive. After being charged, Nawaz was able to ""mix with the political wing"" of the prison where he met assassins of Sadat, the leader of the Muslim Brotherhood and the founder of Egypt’s then-largest terrorist group. He soon realized how the prison served as an incubator for radicalism. CLICK HERE TO GET FOX NATION   ""If you torture somebody’s 17-year-old child in front of them by electrocution to force them to confess, which is what happens... then the father...will go mad and so violence... it’s a mad response. It’s a response born of sheer instinct, reaction."" Amnesty International eventually adopted his case, among others, as prisoners of conscience and after he was released from prison, he renounced the ideology and founded Quilliam to challenge extremism and work in public policy. Now, he explains why it is so important to have a Constitutional government that upholds human rights. ""The minute you can chip away at the sacred nature of (the Constitution), the easier it will be to start adapting it, changing it, amending it for your purposes,"" he said. Fox Nation programs are viewable on-demand and from your mobile device app, but only for Fox Nation subscribers. Go to Fox Nation to start a free trial and watch the extensive library from your favorite Fox News personalities.

Of course, this all starts in the home and at church, but it should be reinforced in the school. Why do you think there's such a high turnout of young first-time voters for Democrats? Democrats like incoherent socialist John Fetterman. They've had teachers telling them America is racist, men can get pregnant and climate change is the biggest threat to the world ever. TOM COTTON CALLS OUT VOTE-COUNTING DELAYS IN ARIZONA, NEVADA: 'OUR NATION DESERVES BETTER'America's government school system is pumping out America hating-socialists who vote. Young people are being conditioned to see the world through the hard left's eyes. Don't ask any questions. Ignore crime, ignore the border — it's your fault. Let them cross. Free speech is for extremists. Don't pay off your loans that's for chumps. Don't like a word? Just change the meaning just a bit. You know, equality? Now it's equity. You don't like your gender? Get rid of it. Parents certainly stay out of that transition and now it takes a few weeks to count all the ballots. That's ""normal."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP This article was written by Fox News staff.

 Facebook Twitter Instagram RSS Email OPINION Published November 9, 2022 8:51am EST Ron DeSantis is the new Republican Party leader Republicans are ready to move on without Donald Trump 
 By
 Liz Peek | Fox News Facebook Twitter Flipboard Comments Print Email close Video Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis wins sweeping re-election bid The 'Fox & Friends' co-hosts discussed Ron DeSantis being the first GOP governor to secure victory in Miami-Dade County since 2002.NEWYou can now listen to Fox News articles!
 The biggest winner of the midterm elections was, without a doubt, Governor Ron DeSantis, whose landslide victory in the state of Florida was breathtaking.The biggest loser? Donald Trump, whose handpicked loyalist candidates in a number of races struggled to beat vulnerable Democrats. Once again, the former president may have cost Republicans control of the Senate, in a year when it was theirs to lose.Many will conclude, on the basis of the midterm 2022 results, that the Republican Party is ready to move on, without Donald Trump as its leader. DeSantis scored a win in Florida that was one for the record books. In Miami-Dade County, a region which President Joe Biden won by 16 percentage points in 2020, the popular governor won easily. Not only was the margin of victory astounding in itself, it also reinforced an emerging reality: Hispanic voters may be shifting their long-term alliance to Republicans.DeSantis won because he embraced Trumpian policies, stood firm against the woke mob, led his state through the pandemic with brilliance and, more recently, managed the horrific damage done by Hurricane Ian with great competence. Florida residents rewarded the popular governor by re-electing him with roughly a 19-point margin over his opponent, Democrat Charlie Crist.On the heels of his win, DeSantis delivered a barnburner victory speech, laying down markers for what will surely be a run for president in 2024 and declaring, ""I have only begun to fight."" VideoFor Donald Trump, the election proved to be, using Barack Obama’s word, a shellacking. In Pennsylvania, Dr. Mehmet Oz, handpicked by Trump to represent the GOP in defending a seat being vacated by retiring Sen. Pat Toomey, lost to Lt. Gov. John Fetterman. Fetterman suffered a stroke early in the contest, but even as his ability to campaign was severely curtailed, he beat out the celebrity doctor.That was not the only bitter disappointment for Republicans. In New Hampshire, incumbent Sen. Maggie Hassan, thought to be the most vulnerable Democrat running for re-election, survived to keep her seat. Her rival, retired Gen. Dan Bolduc, was another Trump-endorsed candidate who had little political experience. Bolduc was considered a long shot and not heavily supported by the GOP establishment, but polling showed him closing in during the final weeks of the race.In Arizona, similarly, Senate candidate Blake Masters, another Trump pick, failed to beat out Democrat incumbent Mark Kelly. Masters was also a political neophyte who had come from behind in recent weeks. He was buoyed by yet another Trump acolyte, gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake, whose race against Democrat Katie Hobbs is too close to call.   It is true that in Ohio, Trump-aligned JD Vance won against Democrat Tim Ryan, and in Georgia, Herschel Walker, backed by Trump, looks to have forced incumbent Raphael Warnock, to a runoff. But both those Senate candidates were helped by popular governors who pulled them along as they easily rolled to victory. Bottom line: there was no red wave. VideoFrom the earliest days of the midterm elections, Trump critics accused the former president of manipulating the contests with a goal of burnishing his own brand instead of prioritizing winning seats for the Republican Party. He endorsed candidates who were personally loyal to him and who backed his claim that Joe Biden’s election was illegitimate.  Democrats were bitterly critical of those ""election deniers;"" Joe Biden traveled the country warning that electing such candidates constituted a ""threat to Democracy."" Even though polls showed that message – and his campaigning – failing to overwhelm kitchen table issues like inflation and crime – voters turned away from GOP contenders they deemed extreme.Not only did Trump choose less-capable candidates, he also withheld much-needed cash to fund their campaigns. The former president began the contest sitting on a campaign chest containing more than $125 million; it is unclear how much he actually spent.The midterms were not a total bust for Republicans. They appear to have won control of the House, which will allow them to put the brakes on Joe Biden’s damaging socialist agenda. But to not have taken full advantage of Biden’s basement-level approval ratings, soaring inflation, rampant crime and the horrific breakdown of our southern border is beyond disappointing. VideoMany, including myself, thought that it would be defeated Democrats engaging in a vast reset in coming weeks as they tried to figure out how to reboot their brand. Instead, it appears that Republicans will be the party assessing where they went wrong and pointing fingers at those responsible for a disappointing outcome.Trump will be blamed for the GOP coming up short. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTERFurther poisoning his brand, Trump in recent days has attacked Ron DeSantis, whom he rightly views as his biggest challenger in a potential run for the Oval Office in 2024. He belittled him by calling him ""DeSanctimonious,"" awarding the Florida governor one of his trademark nicknames that – like Sleepy Joe – have sometimes stuck. Trump also childishly threatened that should DeSantis decide to throw his hat in the 2024 ring, The Donald would reveal unflattering information about the governor.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPTrump may be ready to play dirty to win the GOP nomination in 2024. If he does, he will not only cement the disdain with which many in his party view him today, he will once again scorch Republican chances of defeating Democrats.Let us hope that the millions of Americans who supported Trump in 2016 and again in 2020 begin to see that his time has passed. If they like his policies, they need to move their allegiance to Ron DeSantis, who has never lost a campaign, and who emerged the big winner in these midterms.CLICK HERE TO  READ MORE FROM LIZ PEEK Liz Peek is a Fox News contributor and former partner of major bracket Wall Street firm Wertheim & Company.

I didn’t take this job as a resume builder. I came to Washington, DC— moved my family here— because I care about this agency, its mission, and the goals of this Administration,"" the letter obtained by Fox News states.Fox News reported on Friday that Magnus is being forced out of his job, which comes after a record-breaking year for the number of migrants attempting to enter the United States through the southern border.TOP BIDEN IMMIGRATION OFFICIAL BEING FORCED FROM JOB AMID RECORD BORDER CROSSINGS, SOURCE SAYS

""While CBP is an operational — not a policy-making — agency, I’ve been closely involved in the major DHS immigration, border security, trade, and other policy discussions throughout my time as Commissioner.

 Facebook Twitter Instagram RSS Email Media Published November 11, 2022 4:27pm EST Twitter manager vomited into trash can after being told by Elon Musk to fire people: Report The New York Times devoted eight reporters and almost 2,600 words to investigating Musk's first few weeks at Twitter 
 By
 Scott Whitlock | Fox News Facebook Twitter Flipboard Comments Print Email close Video Howard Kurtz: Media thinks Elon Musk's free speech approach is going to ruin Twitter 'Media Buzz' host Howard Kurtz gives his take on Elon Musk's Twitter takeover on 'The Story.'The New York Times on Friday devoted eight reporters and 2,598 words to investigating Elon Musk’s first few weeks after buying Twitter. The big takeaway? Twice, the paper told readers that the billionaire’s moves resulted in vomit. Writers Kate Conger, Mike Isaac, Ryan Mac and Tiffany Hsu (with additional interviews by Kevin Roose, Lauren Hirsch, Kitty Bennett and David McCabe) authored a largely negative piece, noting the throw-up early in the story. They explained, ""One engineering manager, upon being told to cut hundreds of workers, vomited into a trash can. Others slept in the office as they worked grueling schedules to meet Mr. Musk’s orders.""Returning to this point later in the article, the journalists repeated, ""One engineering manager was approached by Mr. Musk’s advisers — or ‘goons,’ as Twitter employees called them — with a list of hundreds of people he had to let go. He vomited into a trash can near his feet.""BIDEN TORCHED OVER CALL TO INVESTIGATE ELON MUSK'S FOREIGN TIES: 'ONE OF THE MOST HYPOCRITICAL STATEMENTS' 
 Many on the left are sounding the alarm about Elon Musk’s potential Twitter takeover.

 By
 Janelle Ash | Fox News Facebook Twitter Flipboard Comments Print Email close Video Alec Baldwin reaches settlement with Halyna Hutchins' family over 'Rust' shooting Senior national correspondent William La Jeunesse and attorney Brian Claypool examine the latest developments in the investigation into the 'Rust' filming shooting on 'The Story with Martha MacCallum.'Alec Baldwin filed a cross-complaint on Friday and is looking to ""clear his name"" after the death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins on the set of ""Rust"" last October.Baldwin's lawsuit alleges negligence by armorer Hannah Guttierez-Reed; prop master Sarah Zachry; first assistant director and safety coordinator David Halls, who handed Baldwin the gun; ammunition supplier Seth Kenney and his company, PDQ Arm & Prop, which also supplied prop weapons for the production.All have previously denied responsibility for the fatal shooting.A rep for Guttierez-Reed provided Fox News Digital with the following statement regarding the case.""Baldwin is the one responsible for this tragedy. He pointed the weapon and pulled the trigger,"" Guttierez-Reed's lawyer argued.Baldwin named those four individuals as cross-defendants in a suit filed against him last year. In court documents obtained by Fox News Digital, Baldwin claimed he relied on the four individuals to make sure the movie set was safe. He noted he has felt ""immense grief"" and faced an ""emotional, physical and financial toll."" 
 Alec Baldwin puts the blame on the tragic ""Rust"" shooting death on three of the crew members and the ammunition supplier.
 (Jim Spellman)ALEC BALDWIN'S ‘RUST’ SHOOTING: WHERE THE INVESTIGATION STANDS ONE YEAR LATER""There can be no doubt that others have suffered from Cross-Defendants’ negligence far more than Baldwin has,"" Baldwin’s attorney, Luke Nikas of Quinn Emanuel, wrote in the suit, referencing the death of Hutchins, how Hutchins' son lost his mother and how director Joel Souza suffered a shoulder injury. ""Though by no means comparable, Baldwin must live with the immense grief, and the resulting emotional, physical, and financial toll, caused by the fact that Cross-Defendants’ negligent conduct, assurances, and supervision put a loaded weapon in his hand and led him, Hutchins, and everyone else on set to believe that his directed use of the weapon was safe,"" the suit went on to say. ""More than anyone else on that set, Baldwin has been wrongfully viewed as the perpetrator of this tragedy. By these Cross-Claims, Baldwin seeks to clear his name and hold Cross-Defendants accountable for their misconduct.""

The group had been rehearsing in a small church on the Bonanza Creek Ranch set.Baldwin has maintained that he did not pull the trigger of the gun — once during a primetime interview shortly following the deadly shooting and again on a recent podcast episode. The actor originally said he had pulled the hammer of the gun back as far as he could and released it.New Mexico’s Office of the Medical Investigator determined the shooting was an accident. However, prosecutors are reviewing the shooting to determine whether criminal charges should be filed.In April, New Mexico’s Occupational Health and Safety Bureau imposed the maximum fine of $137,000 against Rust Movie Productions and distributed a scathing narrative of safety failures, including testimony that production managers took limited or no action to address two misfires of blank ammunition on set prior to the fatal shooting. The company is challenging the fine.In October, Hutchins' family announced they had agreed to settle another lawsuit against the actor and the movie’s producers, and producers said they aimed to restart the project in January.Fox News Digital's Ashley Hume and The Associated Press contributed to this report Janelle Ash is an entertainment writer for Fox News Digital.

 Facebook Twitter Instagram RSS Email Democrats Published November 11, 2022 1:26pm EST Troubled crypto boss Sam Bankman-Fried, who lost $15B in a week, funneled millions to Dems, far-left causes Bankman-Fried, now estimated to have no material wealth, recently emerged as one of Democrats' largest financial backers 
 By
 Thomas Catenacci , Joe Schoffstall | Fox News Facebook Twitter Flipboard Comments Print Email close Video Varney: Crypto lost $2 trillion worth of value FOX Business host Stuart Varney on tech stocks and cryptocurrency value tanking. Sam Bankman-Fried, the now-bankrupt founder of crypto exchange FTX, is a prolific donor of Democratic candidates and liberal causes, and infused at least $38 million into left-wing groups during the 2022 election cycle.Bankman-Fried was the second-largest contributor to Democratic-affiliated political action committees (PACs) and organizations, behind only liberal financial magnate George Soros, who donated nearly $127 million during the midterm cycle, according to Federal Election Commission (FEC) data. However, the collapse of FTX this week has called into question Bankman-Fried's finances.A full-fledged liquidity crisis forced FTX to file for bankruptcy on Friday, and Bankman-Fried's wealth, which was estimated to be $15.6 billion earlier this week, has sharply plummeted, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The index currently estimates Bankman-Fried has no material wealth.""I'm sorry. That's the biggest thing,"" Bankman-Fried tweeted Thursday morning. ""I f---ed up, and should have done better.""FTX FOUNDER SAM BANKMAN-FRIED'S CRYPTO COLLAPSE APOLOGYBankman-Fried's philanthropic collective, the FTX Foundation, which was committed to fighting climate change and other global health issues, disintegrated as a result of the crisis. The group has supported the CarbonPlan and Giving Green, two climate initiatives dedicated to achieving a so-called green transition from fossil fuels, and the Good Food Institute, an organization pushing the expansion of plant-based meat.Leaders of the collective resigned Friday and said the group would no longer be able to perform its work or process grants.HERE ARE THE BIG MONEY DONORS BANKROLLING EACH SIDE ONE WEEK OUT FROM THE ELECTION""We are devastated to say that it looks likely that there are many committed grants that the Future Fund will be unable to honor,"" they wrote on a blog post. ""We are so sorry that it has come to this.""We joined the Future Fund to support incredible people and projects, and this outcome is heartbreaking to us."" 
 Sam Bankman-Fried contributed at least $38.2 million into left-wing causes ahead of the midterm election.
 (Ting Shen/Bloomberg via Getty Images)During the midterm election cycle, Bankman-Fried funneled most of his contributions to Protect Our Future PAC and House Majority PAC, both of which exclusively supported Democratic candidates.Protect Our Future was the primary recipient of his midterm largesse and received $27 million from the crypto magnate, making him by far the PAC's largest donor.Protect Our Future, in turn, spent more than $24 million backing various Democratic candidates with ad buys and direct mail services. The PAC also transferred millions to other groups, including nearly $900,000 to the Justice Unites Us PAC on April 1, FEC records show.Days after that donation, Justice Unites Us dropped roughly the same amount into canvassing for Carrick Flynn in Oregon's 6th Congressional District. Flynn, however, suffered an 18-point Democratic primary loss to Andrea Salinas.Bankman-Fried also pushed $6 million to the Nancy Pelosi-aligned House Majority PAC, which works to elect and maintain Democrats in Congress's lower chamber, and a half million dollars to the Chuck Schumer-tied Senate Majority PAC.BEYOND GEORGE SOROS, REPUBLICAN MEGA-DONORS REPRESENT 7 OF TOP 10 INDIVIDUALS POURING INTO $17B MIDTERMS 
 In October, Sam Bankman-Fried backed off a pledge to give $1 billion in political contributions through 2024, saying he would instead give closer to $100 million.

Sen.-elect John Fetterman in Pennsylvania, Rep. Jasmine Crockett in Texas, and House candidates Jonathan Jackson in Illinois and Adam Hollier in Michigan were among those who benefited from the cash, Web3 Forward's filings show.Bankman-Fried sent six figures to several other groups, including the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.In October, Bankman-Fried backed off a pledge to give $1 billion in political contributions through 2024, saying he would instead give closer to $100 million, he told Politico.

 Facebook Twitter Instagram RSS Email Kevin McCarthy Published November 11, 2022 11:53am EST McCarthy faces tough math problem in House speaker's race if GOP wins majority If the GOP wins the House, it will likely be a very slim majority, making House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy's path to speaker's chair complex 
 By
 Chad Pergram | Fox News Facebook Twitter Flipboard Comments Print Email close Video Kevin McCarthy 'not concerned' about possible obstacles in bid for House Speaker Fox News' Chad Pergram provides details on Rep. Kevin McCarthy's effort to become Speaker of the House. Current House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., was majority leader on Oct. 8, 2015. He walked over to House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, in the cavernous House Ways and Means Committee hearing room on Capitol Hill.House Republicans were meeting to select a successor to Boehner. The Ohio Republican had abruptly announced he was departing Congress after a meeting with Pope Francis at the Capitol a few days before.As majority leader, McCarthy was in line to succeed Boehner. The full house would have to elect McCarthy, but first, the House Republican Conference needed to settle on its candidate. It was thought to be a fait accompli for McCarthy.McCarthy whispered something into Boehner’s ear. Boehner was surprised, and then strode to the microphone with an announcement for the room. However, no one could hear over the din.THE HITCHHIKER’S GUIDE TO MCCARTHY’S BUMPY ROAD TO THE SPEAKER’S SUITE 
 Pope Francis waves to a crowd from the Speaker's Balcony on the West Front of the Capitol as he stands with then Vice President Joe Biden (2nd L), then House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (4th from R), then Speaker of the House John Boehner (3rd R), then House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Cardinal Donald Wuerl (R)
 (REUTERS/Carlos Barria)Republican members spilled out into the marble corridors of the Longworth House Office Building — the most acoustically-challenged location in all of Washington. A wall of reporters occupied three hallways. A bank of television cameras stood tripod to tripod near the foyer of the building between massive columns. Metal detectors and magnetometers from the U.S. Capitol Police beeped at regular intervals, as tourists and lobbyists tried to squeeze into the building. Capitol maintenance workers wheeled by stocks of cardboard boxes on hand trucks. Gigantic carts rumbled through the hall, loaded with office furniture, making a ridiculous ruckus.Nobody could hear a thing, least of all the Republicans in the room or the reporters in the hallway. However, a rumor swirled. It had to do with what Boehner said over the noise in the committee room. Apparently McCarthy told Boehner he was dropping out.Republicans did not know what was going on, but the conference meeting ended without a vote for speaker.Gossip reigned in the hall. Future House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wisc., dashed out of the room with the speed of Usain Bolt. Ryan’s office then published a statement just as quick to declare that he would not stand as a candidate for speaker.CONGRESSIONAL REPUBLICANS RECKON WITH DISAPPOINTING ELECTION RESULTS: ‘KNIVES ARE OUT,’ SOURCE SAYS 
 U.S. House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) (C) and House Majority Whip Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) (R) arrive for a Republican caucus meeting at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, Oct. 15, 2013.
 (REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst)A phalanx of reporters pursued House Minority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., down a spiral staircase, asking if he would seek the Speakership. Scalise fixed his gaze on each step so he would not fall — and also did not acknowledge the press corps as reporters barked questions whether he would run for speaker.Some Republicans in the rooms were bewildered. There were other candidates for speaker. In fact, there may even be other GOPers who would like to have run now that McCarthy was done. Why didn’t the GOP just forge ahead with the election?However, that is not what went down.A few days later, Ryan backtracked. After some coaxing, Ryan announced that he would in fact run for speaker. Ryan then rode to victory over Rep. Daniel Webster, R-Fla.Many thought McCarthy was a political dead man walking after stepping aside in 2015 to make room for Ryan.Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, even challenged McCarthy for minority leader in late 2018.REPUBLICANS POINTING FINGERS AFTER WEAK MIDTERM RESULTS, DIRECTION OF PARTY IN QUESTION: ‘SOMETHING WAS OFF’However, McCarthy’s fortunes evolved. He brought his rival Jordan into the fold. There was chatter behind the scenes that Scalise may be angling to take on McCarthy. McCarthy then had it out on the phone with former President Trump as a mob ransacked the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. McCarthy even said Trump bore responsibility for the siege.However, politics is about reading the room. McCarthy quickly recognized that many House Republicans heard from constituents who supported the rioters and still embraced the former president.McCarthy hustled off to Mar-a-Lago, posed with former President Trump and immediately set about recruiting female and minority Republicans for the 2022 midterms.McCarthy also knew he had to shore up a schism with the conservative House Freedom Caucus. Aligning himself with Jordan — who used to lead the group — was key. However, there was even a more controversial brand of Freedom Caucus member on the scene now. There were the likes of Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga.House Democrats actually helped McCarthy by giving him a foil. 
 Former President Trump and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., meet at Mar-a-lago in January 2021. 
 (Save America PAC)The House voted to strip Greene and Rep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., from their committee assignments. McCarthy then converted their banishments into a cause celebre, promising he would reseat Greene and Gosar on committees if Republicans won the House. Moreover, there were suggestions that Republicans might return the favor and dismiss Democrats, like Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., from their committees should Republicans prevail. GOP loyalists roared in approval.McCarthy also took steps to legitimize Greene. He took Greene on a trip to the border. Greene was seated prominently behind McCarthy at a September event when House Republicans rolled out their agenda for 2023.You reap what you sow.McCarthy will soon face pressure from conservatives like Greene, Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., and the GOP base to take aggressive action against President Biden and members of his administration.Republicans may be headed for a slim majority in the House once all the votes from Tuesday's midterm elections are tallied. The entire House will select the speaker, and the successful candidate must have an outright majority of the entire House. In other words, 218 votes out of 435.The House must vote repeatedly until it elects a speaker. A vote for speaker has not gone to a second ballot since 1923.Before Tuesday, McCarthy probably had a range of seven to 10 Republicans who would not support him for speaker no matter what. That number could grow.McCarthy may be able to command the votes so long as he can keep Jordan in the fold.That is to say nothing of former President Trump.It would not take much for Trump to throw McCarthy under the bus, especially considering the GOP’s tepid success on Tuesday.However, there is a reason McCarthy did not become Speaker in 2015 when former Speaker Boehner resigned. McCarthy announced on Fox News that Republicans empaneled the Benghazi committee just to undercut the presidential bid of Hillary Clinton. It was as though McCarthy said the quiet part out loud.Support for McCarthy to succeed Boehner was already shaky, and some Republicans were already looking for a reason to oppose McCarthy. They found it in the Benghazi remark — and McCarthy was toast in that contest.Perhaps history could repeat itself.

 (AP Photo/Alex Brandon)After being promised a ""red wave,"" some Republicans may be looking for a reason to dump McCarthy. Tuesday’s weak tea at the ballot box could justify some GOP opposition to McCarthy for speaker. Moreover, if McCarthy does become speaker, he must veer to the right to accede to the demands of the Freedom Caucus on a host of issue — ranging from impeachments to funding the government to raising the debt ceiling — in order to make full use of the slim majority.In addition, the calling card of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., is passing major bills with the most narrow of margins. She has done it for two decades. Heretofore, McCarthy has lacked such an accurate vote counting prowess.McCarthy could face instant management problems.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPIn fact, McCarthy’s first challenge could come in mid-December. That is when a bill to avert a government shutdown comes due. If McCarthy does not stand against that bill and do what the Freedom Caucus wants, those same members could hold that against him when the House votes for Speaker in January.As we say, it will be ""about the math"" when it comes to McCarthy.And, so far, the algebraic equation for McCarthy’s ascent to the speaker’s suite is hard to solve. Chad Pergram currently serves as a senior congressional correspondent for FOX News Channel (FNC). He joined the network in September 2007 and is based out of Washington, D.C.

 By
 Nikolas Lanum | Fox News Facebook Twitter Flipboard Comments Print Email close Video Stacey Abrams' political career is 'done' after Gov. Brian Kemp wins re-election: Janelle King Speak Georgia Inc. co-founder Janelle King joined 'Fox & Friends First' to discuss Kemp's victory over Abrams and the Senate race between Raphael Warnock and Herschel Walker. The New York Times penned a retrospective on Stacey Abrams' gubernatorial campaign in Georgia, painting her road to defeat as one curtailed by lofty national ambitions and a neglect of Black and brown communities in the state. Reporters Maya King and Reid J. Epstein wrote that while Abrams’ first campaign gave her the appearance of a ""fierce political tactician,"" her second attempt at office ""exposed the limits"" of her skills as a political candidate. Abrams was easily defeated by Republican Gov. Brian Kemp in a highly anticipated rematch from 2018, and she didn't seriously threaten him in polls throughout the campaign.The Times interviewed a variety of figures close to Abrams, including lawmakers, community leaders and campaign aides, who painted her as a candidate distracted by national ambitions. She also was characterized as a politician better at talking policy than engaging in ""rope-line hugs"" and empathetic small talk. BETO O'ROURKE, STACEY ABRAMS RAZZED AFTER REPEATED LOSSES: ‘THEY'RE AMAZING AT SETTING DEMOCRAT MONEY ON FIRE’

 (Dustin Chambers/Bloomberg via Getty Images)Despite claims from Abrams supporters who blamed sexism, racism and voter suppression for her string of defeats, the Times noted that Abrams' fate may have been etched before her campaign even took off. Abrams’ actions appeared to suggest that her sights were set on things outside of Georgia, rather than the people of the state deciding whether to elect her. In May, Abrams called Georgia the ""worst state in the country to live in."" She also declared on ""The View"" that she wanted to one day be president of the United States.""She shot herself in the foot multiple times,"" Martha Zoller, a conservative radio host and former Brian Kemp aide, said. ""And the question was asked in many circles: If you really believe this about Georgia, why would you want to be governor?""The Times also spoke with David Brand, an Atlanta-based Democratic strategist, who was one of several Democrats that complained that Abrams was ""neglecting"" those who brought her into the political spotlight. ""She’s having Zoom meetings with Black businesspeople,"" Brand said. ""Brian Kemp’s having cocktails with them.""GEORGIA GOV. BRIAN KEMP WINS RE-ELECTION, DEFEATS DEMOCRAT STACEY ABRAMS

Derrick Jackson, an Atlanta-area state representative and member of Alpha Phi Alpha, said that he and several other groups invited Abrams to their gatherings in the spring, but she did not attend. Abrams eventually held a town hall event with the organizations months later, after polling showed her losing support with Black voters. Jackson said that Abrams needs to own some of her failures. DESPITE LOSS, MSNBC PANEL HAILS STACEY ABRAMS AS 'MOSES,' SAYS SHE 'PUT GEORGIA ON THE MAP FOR DEMOCRATS'

 (Fox News Digital/Hannah Ray Lambert)""If you’re running a statewide race, if you venture off, and you nationalize it, then that’s problematic,"" he said. People who worked closely with Abrams revealed that she was often removed from her constituents, according to the Times. ""Her campaign events were long on relatable anecdotes and policy explanations and short on up-close, personal moments. In her concession speech on Tuesday, she even acknowledged her introverted style,"" the paper noted. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPAn official for the New Georgia Project, Paul Glaze, knocked Abrams for always appearing ""100% poised and perfect all the time.""""It’s kind of hard to reach people that are turned off by the process if you don’t give off the perception or don’t appear willing to piss off the powers that be,"" he said.

 By
 Paul Steinhauser | Fox News Facebook Twitter Flipboard Comments Print Email close Video Trump seems 'hellbent' on making presidential announcement soon: Mara Liasson Mara Liasson, Guy Benson and Marc Thiessen weigh in on presidential prospects following the 2022 midterm elections on 'Special Report.'With the GOP’s push to win back the Senate majority potentially coming down to the Senate runoff election in Georgia, a growing number of allies of Donald Trump are publicly and privately urging the former president not to make his expected 2024 announcement next Tuesday.Among the latest to call for Trump to postpone his announcement until after the Dec. 6 runoff election between Republican nominee Herschel Walker and Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock is veteran Republican consultant and Trump 2016 campaign senior adviser Mike Biundo.""I believe Donald Trump should wait to make an announcement about 2024 until after the Georgia runoff. Right now, Walker’s campaign needs to be the priority and focus for our party,"" Biundo emphasized in a tweet and a conversation with Fox News.But a source with knowledge of Trump’s thinking says ""regardless of the advice,"" he believes the former president will go ahead and make 2024 running news next week.BATTLE LINES DRAWN IN GEORGIA'S CRUCIAL SENATE RUNOFF ELECTION 
 Former President Donald Trump speaks during an election night event at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida, on Tuesday.
 (Joe Raedle/Getty Images)Warnock finished roughly 35,000 votes ahead of Walker out of nearly 4 million votes cast in Tuesday’s election. The Georgia Secretary of State's office announced Wednesday that the Senate election was headed to a runoff since no candidate received over 50% of the vote. According to the latest unofficial and incomplete returns, Warnock was at 49.4%, Walker at 48.5% and Libertarian Party nominee Chase Oliver at 2.1%. Under Georgia law, if no candidate tops 50% of the vote in the general election, the two top vote-getters compete in a runoff, which in this case will be held Dec. 6.FIRST ON FOX: WALKER HAULS IN $7.6 MILLION IN FIRST TWO DAYS OF RUNOFF CAMPAIGNWith votes in the midterm elections still being counted in the battleground states of Arizona and Nevada, and those Senate races still too close to call, the Republicans hold a 49-48 edge over the Democrats for control of the 100-member chamber. If either the Republicans or Democrats sweep both of those contests, control of the Senate will be settled. 
 Sen. Raphael Warnock, D-Ga., waves after giving a speech at his election night party at the Atlanta Marriott Marquis in Atlanta, Georgia, on Tuesday.
 (Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images)However, if the two parties split the contests in Arizona and Nevada, the Senate majority will be at stake in the Georgia runoff election. In Arizona, Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly currently holds a slight lead over GOP challenger Blake Masters, while in Nevada, Republican challenger and former State Attorney General Adam Laxalt maintains a razor-thin edge over Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto.Trump is already under fire by many in the Republican Party who argue that the former president’s backing of far right MAGA loyalists in GOP primaries hurt the party in this week’s general election, downsizing a potential red wave into a more of a trickle. But he appears to be moving ahead with what he’s touting as a ""special announcement"" on Tuesday night at his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida.TRUMP TELLS FOX NEWS ‘WHY WOULD ANYTHING CHANGE’ ON 2024 ANNOUNCEMENTThe former president, touting the wins of the more than 200 ""great"" Republican candidates he endorsed who were able to claim victory in their midterm election races, said in a Fox News Digital interview on Wednesday that his plans to make a ""major"" announcement on Tuesday have not changed.""We had tremendous success,"" Trump told Fox News Digital’s Brooke Singman, adding, ""Why would anything change?"" in reference to the upcoming announcement.Sources in Trump’s political orbit tell Fox News that top aides at Mar-a-Lago are urging Trump to move forward with that announcement. But they add that the former president continues to call friends and advisers, asking for their advice.Some of those people are giving their advice publicly.Jason Miller, a top official on the 2016 and 2020 Trump campaigns, says he’s encouraging Trump to delay the announcement until after the Senate runoff election is over.So is Fox News contributor and former Trump White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany. Video""I know there’s a temptation to starting talking about 2024 — no, no, no, no, no,"" McEnany said on Wednesday’s edition of Fox News’ ""Outnumbered."" ""2022 is not over. Every Republican energy needs to go to grinding the Biden agenda to a halt, and that could go straight through the state of Georgia,"" she said.McEnany, a co-host of the program, added that when it comes to a likely Trump 2024 announcement on Tuesday, ""I think he needs to put it on pause, absolutely.""Biundo urged the former president ""to heed his own words and put America first… I really think he would do everyone a favor, including himself, if he would take a step back, take a deep breath, cool the rhetoric, and let’s all work together to make sure Herschel Walker is the next senator from Georgia.""AFTER SLAMMING DESANTIS, TRUMP KNOCKS YOUNGKINPointing to Trump’s widely criticized verbal attacks this week at potential 2024 GOP nomination rivals — Republican Govs. Ron DeSantis of Florida and Glenn Youngkin of Virginia — Biundo said ""he seems like he's hot right now and upset about things.""He noted that ""there are a lot of people — some of them quietly, some of them more publicly — who’ve come out and said this. People that worked for him and actually do want to see him do well. And he would do well to listen to them.""Georgia Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan, a vocal Republican critic of the former president, called Trump a ""conservative distraction"" when it comes to the Senate runoff election in his state. 
 Republican U.S. Senate nominee Herschel Walker speaks to supporters as his wife Julie Blanchard looks on during an election night event in Atlanta, Georgia, on Tuesday.
 (Alex Wong/Getty Images)Duncan, who opted against running for re-election this year to focus on his effort to reboot what he hopes will be a post-Trump GOP, told Fox News he would encourage Walker ""to call Donald Trump personally and tell him to stay home, to stay out of Georgia. Enough’s enough.""Corey Lewandowski, a longtime top Trump adviser who managed Trump’s historic 2016 presidential primary campaign, also urged Trump to wait on any 2024 declaration — but for a different reason. ""Getting in early for a guy with 100% name ID — you don’t need to,"" Lewandowski emphasized.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""Once you become an official candidate, there are limitations on what you can and cannot do. Being a non-candidate is actually advantageous for a guy with 100% name ID and $100 million in the bank,"" he said.But a source close to the former president tells Fox News that Trump is ""going to announce on Tuesday"" regardless of advice from some people in the former president’s orbit. ""I am very certain that is what he’s going to do."" Paul Steinhauser is a politics reporter based in New Hampshire.

DeSantis' re-election.Twitter users reacted to the news that a federal judge in Texas blocked President Biden’s student loan handout.On Thursday, U.S. District Judge Mark Pittman ruled that Biden’s executive action was unconstitutional because Congress didn’t approve the sweeping plan. In fact, the judge claimed it was one of the largest executive branch overreaches in the ""history of the United States.""As Fox Business reported, Pittman’s opinion on the ruling stated, ""No one can plausibly deny that it is either one of the largest delegations of legislative power to the executive branch, or one of the largest exercises of legislative power without congressional authority in the history of the United States.""GUTFELD: BIDEN'S STUDENT LOAN HANDOUT IS ON HOLD AGAIN | FOX NEWS VIDEO 
 A federal judge ruled that Biden's student loan handout was unconstitutional. 
 The handout, announced by Biden in August, was intended to provide upwards of $20,000 of student debt relief to borrowers making under $125,000 a year. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the plan would have cost American taxpayers over $400 billion.Liberals on the platform expressed outrage over the ruling, while conservatives ridiculed Biden’s entire handout strategy as being a cynical ploy to garner Democratic votes for the midterms.  The Federalist co-founder Sean Davis wrote, ""Doesn’t matter to Biden. Its only purpose was to buy votes for last Tuesday.""American Greatness senior Fellow Ned Ryun tweeted, ""Fascinating. Motivated under 30s to come out and vote and in the end, Biden got what he wanted and they got played for fools.""Liberal radio host Kyle Kulinski expressed frustrated over the ruling, stating, ""92% of student loan debt is owned by the federal government but apparently the federal government doesn’t have the right to reduce it? Oh please. Conservative judges are judicial activists who make sh-- up to f--- over poor people. Thankfully this will be appealed.""Conservative actor Rob Schneider seemed relieved over the ruling, commenting, ""A federal judge tonight vacated the Presidents executive order to forgive student loans on a mass basis as unlawful. I’m glad that I’m not the only one who feel that transferring 1/2 trillion dollars from working people to college graduates is crazy.""Former ""Mad TV"" actress and Twitter liberal Mo Collins remarked, ""Of course this happened.""AMID ECONOMIC WOES, NBC NEWS REPORTS MOST STUDENT LOAN HANDOUT RECIPIENTS SPENDING MONEY ON ‘TRAVEL,’ ‘DINING'

 (Paul Morigi/Getty Images for We the 45m)Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., blasted the judge who denied Biden’s handout from going forward. She tweeted, ""Republican officials are trying to stop millions of working and middle class Americans from getting student debt relief. Despite this lawless ruling from a Trump-appointed judge, @POTUS’ legal authority to cancel student debt is clear.""The Blaze’s Matt Kibbe gave kudos to what he claimed was a Biden scheme. He tweeted, ""Give Biden credit: Student loan forgiveness was cynical and dishonest, but also the best bait and switch scheme in modern political history.""CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPRep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., was not pleased with the decision. She tweeted, ""This is a ludicrous opinion from a Trump-appointed judge. I'm glad the Administration is appealing. Dems are fighting for middle class relief while GOP special interests & judges are trying to block it on outlandish grounds.""Turning Point USA pundit Graham Allen summarized the strategy of Biden’s student loan handout, tweeting, ""Biden knew he couldn’t ‘forgive’ your student loan debt….. He lied for votes knowing it would get thrown out in court!"" 
 President Biden announced his student loan handout plan in August.

 By
 Tyler Olson , Kelly Phares | Fox News Facebook Twitter Flipboard Comments Print Email close Video Georgia Senate race goes 'back to square one': Doug Collins Former Georgia congressman Doug Collins says the Georgia senate runoff is less about endorsements, and more about getting voters back to the polls.Sen. Marco Rubio is calling for Senate Republicans to delay their leadership elections, as more members of the party's conference in the Senate appear to be bucking Minority Leader Mitch McConnell.""The Senate GOP leadership vote next week should be postponed,"" Rubio, R-Fla., tweeted Friday. ""First we need to make sure that those who want to lead us are genuinely committed to fighting for the priorities & values of the working Americans (of every background) who gave us big wins in states like #Florida."" 
 Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., called for a delay in the Senate GOP's leadership elections on Friday.
 (Eva Marie Uzcategui/Bloomberg via Getty Images)MISSOURI REPUBLICANS HAWLEY AND SCHMITT SAY SENATE NEEDS NEW LEADERSHIP: ‘NOT MITCH MCCONNELL’Rubio is just the latest Republican to take an apparent swipe at McConnell, R-Ky. Multiple GOP Senate candidates, including Sen.-elect Eric Schmitt, R-Mo., have said they would not support McConnell for party leader for the next Congress. Schmitt's fellow Missourian, GOP Sen. Josh Hawley, has also attacked McConnell in recent weeks. He supported Rubio's call for a delay in leadership elections in a tweet.

I don’t know why Senate GOP would hold a leadership vote for the next Congress before this election is finished,"" Hawley said. ""We have a runoff in #GASenate - are they saying that doesn’t matter? Don’t disenfranchise @HerschelWalker.""Sen. Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyo., also backed up Rubio, tweeting, ""Second,"" in response to his post. ""It makes no sense for Senate to have leadership elections before GA runoff. We don’t yet know whether we’ll have a majority & Herschel Walker deserves a say in our leadership,"" Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, added later Friday. :Critically, we need to hear a specific plan for the next 2 yrs from any candidate for leadership.""MIDTERM ELECTIONS: HAWLEY SLAMS ‘WASHINGTON REPUBLICANISM’ AFTER RED WAVE FIZZLESIt is not clear there are even close to enough votes to block McConnell from being the Republicans' party leader in the next Congress. He has enjoyed significant support from GOP senators in the past, and would become the longest-serving Senate party leader ever if re-elected as the top Republican in the chamber. Furthermore, elections for Senate leader — unlike House speaker — are done by a simple majority of the conference, rather than a majority of the chamber. That gives McConnell significant cushion, even if several senators vocally come out against him. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPMcConnell's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Fox News' Chris Pandolfo and Haris Alic contributed to this report.  Tyler Olson is a reporter covering the Senate for Fox News Digital.

 Facebook Twitter Instagram RSS Email Politics Published November 11, 2022 3:07pm EST Trump mocks another potential GOP 2024 opponent, saying Virginia Gov. Youngkin's name 'sounds Chinese' Trump is returning to 2016 form by belittling people he sees as a threat to his nomination 
 By
 Houston Keene | Fox News Facebook Twitter Flipboard Comments Print Email close Video Trump goes after 'Ron DeSanctimonious' again after Florida governor's re-election Fox News’ Kevin Corke reports on the battle for control of Congress, with key races in Arizona, Nevada and Georgia still too close to call, and discusses former President Donald Trump taking a dig at Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis.Former President Donald Trump is adding to the list of other Republicans he is singling out for ridicule in the leadup to his expected presidential campaign announcement Tuesday, dropping popular Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin into his crosshairs.Trump wrote in a TruthSocial post on Friday that the Old Dominion governor’s name sounds ""Chinese,"" while spelling it almost like South Korean-born California GOP Rep. Young Kim’s name. Kim was re-elected to the House in the midterm elections.""Young Kin (now that’s an interesting take. Sounds Chinese, doesn’t it?) in Virginia couldn’t have won without me,"" Trump wrote on TruthSocial. ""I Endorsed him, did a very big Trump Rally for him telephonically, got MAGA to Vote for him - or he couldn’t have come close to winning.""But he knows that, and admits it,"" Trump continued. ""Besides, having a hard time with the Dems in Virginia - But he’ll get it done!""Youngkin has been traveling the country to campaign for other Republicans and is thought to be mulling a presidential run. 
 Former President Donald Trump's TruthSocial post attacking Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin.
 (Fox News Digital)Trump has been teasing his return to the campaign trail for months, and, true to style, he’s already taking shots at potential political rivals. The focus on his opponents names recalls the 2016 presidential campaign, when terms like ""Little Marco"" for Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and ""Low Energy Jeb"" for former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush diminished his opponents to great effect.The former president ruffled Republican feathers earlier this week when he opened fire on Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis during a Pennsylvania rally just days before the midterm elections, branding him the new nickname ""Ron DeSanctimonious.""REPUBLICANS SPLIT ON TRUMP’S EFFECT ON LACKLUSTER MIDTERMS AS CONTROL OF CONGRESS HANGS IN BALANCE 
 Former President Donald Trump has been taking aim at potential 2024 political rivals months ahead of the GOP primary election.
 (AP Photo/Evan Vucci, File)""We’re winning big in the Republican Party for the nomination like nobody’s ever seen before,"" Trump said before listing other Republicans who may challenge him, as well as their approval ratings.""There it is, Trump at 71%, Ron DeSanctimonious at 10%,"" Trump said. ""Mike Pence at 7, oh, Mike is doing better than I thought. Liz Cheney, there’s no way she’s at 4%. There’s no way. There’s no way. But we’re at 71 to 10 to 7 to 4.""Trump sparked immediate backlash from many Republicans, who criticized the former president for taking the jab at DeSantis a few days before the midterm elections.The former president attacked DeSantis with the same nickname following the election, continuing his digs at his former political protégé.DeSantis handily prevailed in the 2022 midterms with Florida’s new red hue a bright spot in a disappointing election for Republicans, who were hoping to ride a red wave into control of Congress.

 (GIORGIO VIERA/AFP via Getty Images)The attack on Youngkin came the day after Virginia Lt. Gov. Winsome Sears said she ""could not support"" Trump in 2024.TRUMP MOCKS DESANTIS AT PENNSYLVANIA RALLY: ‘RON DESANCTIMONIOUS’Similar in response to the attacks on DeSantis, Trump faced heavy criticism for his attack on Youngkin from Republicans who defended the Virginia governor.Youngkin reacted to the attack on Friday while speaking with reporters, saying he ""didn't see it"" and that name-calling wasn't his style.""You all know me, I do not call people names, I really work hard to bring people together, and that's what we're working to do,"" Youngkin said.""Well, that's what I'm saying, and that's just not the way I roll and not the way I behave,"" the Virginia governor said when pressed by reporters saying he had been called a name by the former president.However, while taking a tough stance against Youngkin and DeSantis, Trump’s jabs at the rising GOP stars also give insight into whom the former president views as potential 2024 threats.Youngkin’s name has been floated as a potential 2024 pick for the Republicans, thanks in part to his successful campaign that made education a central issue and rallied people to vote across the aisle.The Old Dominion governor’s campaign also walked a line between MAGA and moderate crowds well by accepting Trump’s endorsement while keeping somewhat distant from the former president.DeSantis’ name has been floated as a potential GOP nominee to take back the White House in 2024 since President Biden took office, and has only grown in the days since his sweeping reelection win.

 Bill Mears | Fox News Facebook Twitter Flipboard Comments Print Email close Video Top US border official being forced out by Biden admin, sources say Fox News’ Mike Tobin reports on claims the White House has asked Customs and Border Patrol chief Chris Magnus to resign amid record migrant crossings.The commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection is being forced out of his job as part of a larger change in top personnel at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), according to a government source.Chris Magnus is resisting leaving the position, after being told by Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas to resign or get fired, according to the source. It comes after a record year of migrants seeking to enter the U.S. along the Mexican border.ARIZONA RANCHER: AFTER MS-13 WALKED THROUGH THE GAP IN THE BORDER WALL, THEY CAME KNOCKING AT MY DOOR 
 Chris Magnus appears before a Senate Finance Committee hearing on his nomination to be the next U.S. Customs and Border Protection commissioner in the Dirksen Senate Office Building on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., on Oct. 19, 2021.
 (Rod Lamkey/Pool via REUTERS/File Picture)Magnus has only been on the job for about a year, and sources say he has clashed with DHS officials over border enforcement policy. Some of Magnus' duties have been taken over by his deputies.BIDEN ADMINISTRATION PROVIDING ABORTION ACCESS TO MIGRANTS DETAINED AT BORDERDHS officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment.New DHS figures show that for the fiscal year ending in September, nearly 2.4 million migrants were detained at the border, a 37% increase from the year before. VideoPresident Biden nominated Magnus for the position in 2021, and he was confirmed in December of that year. Magnus has faced a number of controversies already, aside from the record border numbers. Fox News reported in October 2021 that Magnus settled a sexual harassment and retaliation case from a former officer in 2017. The case stemmed from his time as Richmond, California, police chief.Last month, it was reported that Magnus was falling asleep during meetings. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP""He’s not in the game,"" an administration official told Politico of Magnus. ""Every time there’s a meeting and he’s in it, we’ll get to a conclusion and Magnus will have some sidebar issue that he wants to raise and we’re all like ‘What the f--- is that about?’"" VideoMagnus defended his performance in an October statement to Fox News.""I care a great deal about CBP and the people who work here. In the 10 months I’ve been CBP’s Commissioner, I’ve gotten up to speed on the agency’s many complex areas of responsibility,"" he said. ""While CBP is an operational — not a policy-making — agency, I’ve been closely involved in the major DHS immigration, border security, trade, and other policy discussions throughout my time as Commissioner. I frequently share insights from CBP’s frontline law enforcement and civilian personnel in those discussions and will continue to do so.""

He urged President Biden and Congress to finish construction in order to protect the country — and him and his wife. He said on one occasion, Chilton's wife, Sue, was home alone and answered a knock on the door to MS-13 members carrying guns.""It’s kind of scary,"" Chilton, who comes from a long line of ranchers, told Fox News. ""That’s just life on the border.""Chilton said thousands of migrants crossed his property in 2022, marking a significant increase from years prior. He suspects many are carrying drugs.On Monday, Arizona border officials in Nogales, around 30 miles from Chilton, seized around 776,000 fentanyl pills, 289 pounds of methamphetamine and 55 pounds of heroin, Customs and Border Protection Nogales Port Director Michael Humphries tweeted. Nearly 15,000 pounds of fentanyl has been seized along the southern border this year, according to CBP. AT LEAST 64,000 ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS EVADED BORDER PATROL IN OCTOBER, 205,000 APPREHENSIONSYet Chilton and his wife have still helped migrants on multiple occasions despite safety concerns as more knocked on their door for help. ""Nobody deserves to die in the desert,"" regardless of whether they are criminals, Chilton said. ""We try to help people by providing water, but all the bad guys come to our ranch.""Chilton said he installed drinking fountains to serve migrants. Still, he's found he's had ""a lot of people die on the ranch.""At least 853 migrants died crossing the southern border this year, surpassing the previous record of 547 in 2021, according to U.S. Border Patrol data obtained by CBS News. 
 The Biden administration halted construction of former President Donald Trump's border wall in January 2021, leaving a gap on Jim Chilton's ranch.
 (Jim Chilton)ARIZONA RANCHER MAKES DESPERATE PLEA TO BIDEN AFTER FINDING TOTAL OF 16 DEAD MIGRANTS ON PROPERTY""We see the humanitarian crisis,"" Chilton said. ""The real truth is a wall can save lives.""Nearly 4 million migrants have crossed into the U.S. since Biden took office, according to CBP. Close to 1 million of those migrants have traveled through Arizona. Chilton blames the influx on the unfinished border wall that Biden halted in 2021. ""Congress needs to appropriate the money to secure the border,"" Chilton said.

 Facebook Twitter Instagram RSS Email Midterm Elections Published November 11, 2022 10:39am EST Who won the House? What you need to know about why it might take ‘weeks’ to be sure There are four slow-counting Western states where races could make or break the GOP takeover of the House 
 By
 Peter Kasperowicz | Fox News Facebook Twitter Flipboard Comments Print Email close Video Kevin McCarthy: I will work with anyone who wants to put America first House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy joined 'Jesse Watters Primetime' to discuss what investigations Republicans will begin if they take back the House. It is still not completely clear which party won control of the House of Representatives three days after the midterm election on Nov. 8, and it might still take weeks to find out for sure.House Republicans continue to operate under the assumption that they won a majority. But that majority will likely be slim, and slow vote counts in California, Arizona, Colorado and Oregon make it impossible to declare any result with certainty.According to the Fox News Decision Desk, Republicans had secured 211 House seats as of Friday morning, seven short of the 218 they need for a majority. Republicans are currently leading in enough outstanding House races to reach that goal.2022 MIDTERM ELECTION RESULTS 
 McCarthy has laid out Republicans' ""commitment to America"" as they try to regain control of the House of Representatives. 
 The biggest factor standing in the way of a clear result is the slow count in California, where more than a dozen House races have yet to be called. The final results in California could make or break the GOP takeover in the House – Republicans hold narrow leads in several of those races, but many of them have still tabulated fewer than 50% of the votes that have come in.According to a count provided late Thursday, more than 4.8 million ballots had yet to be processed. California’s Secretary of State Shirley Weber says it could still be weeks before it becomes clear who wins these races.""It typically takes weeks for counties to process and count all of the ballots,"" Weber’s office says on its website. ""Elections officials have approximately one month to complete their extensive tallying, auditing, and certification work (known as the official canvass).""MCCARTHY OFFICIALLY ANNOUNCES SPEAKER RUN, MAKING CASE TO FELLOW REPUBLICANS AFTER MIDTERMS MISS EXPECTATIONS 
 House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., says Republicans will take the House.
 (REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst)Under California law, mail-in ballots must be postmarked on or before Election Day, but can still be received by county election officials up to seven days after the election and still be counted.California state law says election officials must report their final results to Weber by Dec. 9.In Arizona, there are still two House races that have yet to be called, and a Republican is leading in one of them. However, just like California, Arizona still has many votes to count.According to Arizona’s Secretary of State Katie Hobbs, who is running for governor, more than 2 million ballots have been tabulated so far, but more than 500,000 remain.""Elections don’t end on Election Day,"" Hobb’s website states. ""It takes time to ensure all eligible votes are counted.""KEVIN MCCARTHY DECLARES GOP WILL TAKE MAJORITY IN THE HOUSE, PUSH OUT PELOSI AS SPEAKER 
 Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.) is one of several Republicans in tight races that have yet to be settled.
 (Photo by Michael B. Thomas/Getty Images)In Colorado, the results in two House races are not yet clear, including GOP incumbent Lauren Boebert’s close race against Democratic challenger Adam Frisch. As of Friday morning, Boebert was up a little more than 1,000 votes.According to Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold, every county in the state is still in a post-election reporting phase of the election as of Friday morning, and none had completed a final counting of ballots. It might still be some days before final results can be seen in this state.Finally, in Oregon, the fate of two close House races remains unclear, in part because that state will continue to count ballots by mail until Nov. 15. Under that state’s law, voters can file complaints about alleged election law violations as late as Nov. 21, and the very last day to resolve all ballot challenges is Nov. 29.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPAside from these four states, a small handful of other close House races are being delayed for various reasons, including waiting for mail-in ballot and absentee vote counts.

 ""Yellowstone,"" created by Taylor Sheridan, tells the tale of a ranching family in Montana as they face off against others encroaching on their land. Cole Hauser stars as Rip Wheeler.
 (Paramount Network)Hauser, who has starred in the drama since 2018, was previously photographed bathing outside for People magazine’s ""Sexiest Man Alive"" issue. And there’s no doubt that Westerns are hotter than ever in Hollywood.After the Kevin Costner-led ""Yellowstone"" became a smash hit, the Paramount+ streaming service ordered the series ""1932"" about the roots of the Dutton ranching family. In February, the service also announced that the first prequel, ""1883,"" will be back for a second season.

""Old Henry,"" an action Western, also premiered late last year.In May of this year, British actor Tom Blyth made his mark as legendary outlaw Billy the Kid for a new EPIX series.Hauser noted there’s a reason why fans can’t get enough of ""Yellowstone"" in particular – and he insisted it has nothing to do with him making hearts flutter.CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER 
 Cole Hauser credited writer Taylor Sheridan for launching the Western comeback in Hollywood.
 (Paramount)""Well, first of all, it’s not the Western, it’s the Taylor Sheridan writing,"" he explained about the filmmaker. ""That starts with him and the stories that he’s telling, the characters that he’s developed, the actors that he’s hired, the crew. In my opinion, [he’s] one of the great American writers and he’s telling the stories that he knows well and cares about.""And the story hits close to home. Hauser grew up in Santa Barbara, California, and on a ranch in Oregon where he spent much of his childhood riding horses and ""cruising around with cows,"" People magazine reported. Hauser noted he feels completely at ease in the show’s Montana setting.""’Yellowstone’ is kind of an extension of [Sheridan’s] love and passion for the West – and I’m that way,"" said Hauser.

 By
 Yael Halon | Fox News Facebook Twitter Flipboard Comments Print Email close Video Brit Hume: DeSantis' big night sharpens competition with Trump Fox News senior political analyst Brit Hume breaks down the apparent tension between Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and former President Donald Trump.The series finale of Paramount+ ""The Good Fight"" left social media users stunned on Thursday for featuring a plot in which a character claimed to be sexually assaulted by Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, only to confess he was lying later on in the show.The finale of the courtroom drama's sixth and final season premiered on Thursday with the episode titled ""The End of Everything."" In a clip widely shared online, the episode features the main character Diane Lockhart, played by Christine Baranski, meeting with Felix Staples, a flamboyant, gay provocateur who has made appearances in earlier seasons of the long-running show. In a conference room surrounded by lawyers, Staples claims that he was sexually assaulted by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who forced him to have oral sex following a CPAC conference while interning for his office. Diane immediately dismisses the accusation as politically motivated ""bulls---"" despite Staples claiming to have DNA proof. The lawyers spend the episode gathering evidence to expose Staples for lying. He eventually confesses to fabricating the allegations to tarnish the Florida governor's reputation, because it will put former President Trump ""ahead in the polling"" in 2024's presidential race.VOTING RESULTS: AMERICANS ARE READY TO BACK ANOTHER RON IN 2024 – DESANTIS

Other users called it the first of many smear campaigns by Hollywood to be brought against the Florida governor as he remains a popular potential 2024 presidential contender. ""Let the smears begin,"" Newsbusters' Brent Baker wrote.""How can you tell the next election has begun? This will give you a hint...,"" Off The Press author Paul Bedard agreed.Spectator USA contributor Stephen L. Miller slammed the episode as ""unhinged.""""Is this kind of thing legal? "" Washington Examiner contributor Harry Khachatrian asked alongside the clip. ""I realize the whole free speech thing is pretty robust, but can you just insert a real public figure into your fictional movie and make him a sex offender?""""This is only the second most outrageous political allusion from this series, the first being that episode of The Good Wife where they pretend Donna Brazile is single-handedly responsible for choosing presidential nominees,"" Free Beacon associate editor Tim Rice recounted.Others pointed out that the clip circulating online was largely taken out of context and failed to show the character's confession to lying about it for political purposes.""Stop sharing that DeSantis TV show clip thing,"" podcaster Noam Blum wrote. ""The whole point of the episode is that the guy is lying and DeSantis didn't do anything.""""This isn't what it sounds like,"" Washington Examiner columnist T. Becket Adams agreed. ""If you know the show, you know the ""accuser"" is a reoccurring character best described as a ratf-cker. He’s lying here, and the lawyers bust him. Show doesn’t actually accuse DeSantis of assault.please do not ask me how i know any of this.""The season finale isn't the first time ""The Good Wife"" spinoff series landed itself in hot water online. In 2019, the show's official Twitter page posted an image from one of its episodes that shows a list of ""target words"" including: ""Assassinate,"" ""President"" and ""Trump"" in a red column and a second orange column that started with the words: ""Mar-a-Lago"" and ""Eliminate."" The show was forced to put out a statement arguing that the post was taken out of context, and ""created an impression and provoked a reaction that was not intended."" 
 Actress Christine Baranski plays Diane Lockhart in 'The Good Fight'
 (2003. REUTERS/Fred Prouser  )CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPMore recently, in the show's fifth season, the episode titled ""Previously On"" featured a rare admission of faith from Diane - a self-declared atheist- for the sake of electing Joe Biden as president. The scene depicted Lockhart having a ""coronary event of some kind"" while watching the updates of the 2020 election in real-time. The show also took a dig at Trump when it tackled the topic of censorship under his administration in a separate episode. Yael Halon is a reporter for Fox News Digital.

He has unseated Democratic incumbent Steve Sisolak.The economy and inflation, education, crime, and the governor’s performance in dealing with the coronavirus pandemic were key issues in the gubernatorial campaign.Sisolak was elected governor in 2018 after spending nearly a decade as a Clark County Commissioner. Lombardo, after serving more than two decades in the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, was elected Clark County Sheriff in 2014. Clark County covers just 7% of the Nevada’s land area, but holds nearly three-quarters of the state’s population, making it by far Nevada’s most populous county.MIDTERM ELECTIONS 2022: LIVE UPDATES

""After four years of Steve Sisolak’s small business and job-killing policies, Governor-elect Lombardo’s unique perspective as a seasoned law enforcement officer and fiscal conservative will get the state moving in the right direction on behalf of all Nevada families.

 Facebook Twitter Instagram RSS Email Veterans Published November 11, 2022 9:19pm EST The search for POW Lt. Dave Carey, a bracelet connects Fox News editor to one of America's heroes Fox News editor united with retired Navy Captain Dave Carey who was a POW in Vietnam for five and a half years. 
 By
 Liz Friden , Jennifer Griffin | Fox News Facebook Twitter Flipboard Comments Print Email close Video Fox News staffer tracks down veteran from POW bracelet Fox News chief national security correspondent Jennifer Griffin sits down with Fox News editor Brad Paxton on 'The Story with Martha MacCallum.' As war raged in Vietnam, a quiet effort started by two sorority sisters to show support for the POW and MIA’s shot down in Vietnam took off across America. Many of these POW’s were held for years at the Hanoi Hilton. Students across America began wearing bracelets with the name of an American POW and the date they were shot down. Stars like John Wayne, Princess Grace and Sonny and Cher wore them. ""We and a lot of other Americans have been wearing bracelets like this for several years, and it's just our quiet way of letting them know that we remember the guys, and they are in our hearts,"" Sonny said on his popular TV show with Cher.  Fox News editor Brad Paxton was one of those kids who sent his $2.50 away to purchase a bracelet. His bracelet honored Navy Lt. Dave Carey, shot down in North Vietnam on Aug. 31, 1967. ""It was a trend that was happening and we kind of wanted to be part of it. It grew to be a much deeper thing for me … after wearing the bracelet for so long, I kind of made a mental commitment to myself to kind of keep his name in my mind,"" Paxton says.  He estimates about 50% of his junior high school was wearing a bracelet back in the day.  ""This was a way to show support for the troops without, in a non-political kind of way. You didn't have to be for the war against the war. You just could be in support of these people who had been captured,"" Paxton said.  He saved the bracelet in a box of trinkets in his basement. Spurred by a conversation with his wife about the bracelets and how they united the country during a divisive war, he decided to try to find Carey, the man whose name he wore on his wrist when he was in 8th grade.  ""I went down and pulled out a box. I knew right where it was and looked it up and then like a lightning bolt, it's kind of like I should just see whatever happened to this guy,’ Paxton said.   
 Bracelet honoring Lt. David Carey.
 (Fox News)VIRGINIA NAVY VETERAN SAYS ALL VETERANS DESERVE THANKS, NOT JUST THOSE WHO SAW BATTLEHe found him in Texas, 80 years old and now an author and motivational speaker. Carey spent five-and-a-half years in the Hanoi Hilton - some of it overlapping with John McCain who was shot down a month and a half after him. Paxton sent Carey an email and a picture of the bracelet. To his surprise, within minutes Carey emailed him back and said he would love to have it.Carey told Paxton how much those bracelets meant to him.  Turns out, Carey has been getting emails like Paxton’s for years.  ""Those bracelets were incredibly important to us. That kind of lifted our morale and reassured us that the folks at home were working on it,"" Carey says. Carey, who retired as a captain, can still vividly recall the day he was shot down. ""The missile went right between us. There was a huge explosion. Fireball blew the tail section of my airplane. The airplane just stayed on its back, starts spinning and tumbling and jirating falling through the sky. It was shaking so bad that it would focus well. I try to see what was going on. It was just a blur.""  VideoWith his plane falling through the sky, Carey got a glimpse of his altimeter and ejected from the plane. His parachute landed in the middle of a small North Vietnamese village. He still remembers the beatings. ""I was interrogated, the interrogation led to beatings, the beatings led to torture,"" Carey recalls.  ""My arms didn't work. My arms that worked for weeks and weeks. I ate by wiggling around on my stomach, stick my face in a bowl of rice."" To help him stay sane, he remembered the first line of the 23rd psalm. ""That line kept coming into my head. … The Lord is my shepherd. I could think about that line."" Carey and his fellow prisoners found other tricks to keep their minds intact. Carey explained, ""I let slip that I had taken French in high school at the Naval Academy, and so I immediately became the French teacher…. That was French, according to me, because there was a lot of stuff I had to make up."" Carey kept his sense of humor through it all.   
 POW bracelet founder Carol Bates Brown.
 (Fox News)MEET A MARINE VETERAN ON A PERSONAL MISSION AGAINST SUICIDEMeanwhile, back in California, the woman who started the bracelet movement, Carol Bates Brown, was a student at California State University Northridge. She and a girlfriend came up with the MIA/POW bracelet concept and tried to convince their parents to let them go to Vietnam.  ""Nobody wants to send two sorority girls to Vietnam in the middle of a war. Parents were horrified. So we ended up trying to make our own,"" Brown said. She and fellow students got materials donated. One of them came up with the idea of putting names on the bracelets.  Brown thought, ""Well, other college kids might want to wear them, too. And when it really took off like it did, it was just shocking and unbelievable."" Brown estimates 5 million bracelets were distributed during that time. The bracelets were especially popular from 1970 to 1973. They cost $2.50, the price it was to see a movie.  ""At the time, that's what it cost to go to a movie in the UCLA area if you were a student. So we decided if the kids could pay for a movie they would pay for a bracelet,"" Brown said.   
 Lieutenant David Carey.
 (Fox News)The campaign led to a decades-long career at the Pentagon for Brown at the Defense Intelligence Agency in the office of POW/Missing Personnel. 55 years later, Carey still has the flag airmen carried in their flight suits in case they had to eject. Carey held it up and read it.  ""It says I am a citizen of the United States of America. I do not speak your language. Misfortune forces me to seek your assistance in obtaining food, shelter and protection. Please take me to someone who can provide for my safety and see that I return to my people, my government will reward you,"" Carey read. But when they heard kids back home were wearing bracelets with their names on them, that gave them hope that they had not been forgotten. ""We kept our sense of humor. And we kept the faith, faith in ourselves, faith in each other, faith in our country and faith in God,"" Carey said.  While in captivity, one of the ways this Naval aviator kept sane was by pretending to play the piano. After his release, he finally learned to play on a real piano. Today he still receives mail from kids now grown who wore those bracelets for him and the other POW/MIAs. GET THE FOX NEWS APP BY CLICKING HERE""I always knew where the bracelet was. I never forgot his name. Even 50 years later, I can tell you about Lt. David Carey,"" Paxton said. ""He's a genuine American hero. And I'm just humbled and to have had a small footnote in his story."" Carey’s book, ""May God Bless Your Choices,"" draws from his time in captivity. He travels the country, speaking to business leaders, helping them by speaking about his own experience.  His message is this: ""They are way stronger, way more resilient, way more resourceful than they ever would give themselves credit for that they just haven't been tested.""   Liz Friden is a Pentagon producer based in Washington, D.C.

That’s exactly what I’ve done in my first two years in office and what I will continue to do for as long as I’m there. It’s been one of the great honors of my life to serve as Arizona’s Senator.

In the book were savings bonds with Olander's name on it. When the tipster searched the name online, he discovered Olander had been murdered. The holy book was a Norwegian Bible and belonged to Olander's family.Investigators soon turned their attention to the resident of the apartment where it had been found, Edson Benitez. He initially told detectives the book was given to him by a friend who moved to Mexico. He soon admitted that his friend Reinol Vergara, a painter at Olander's house, knew the farmer had a lot of money.  
 Edson Benitez
 (Minnesota Department of Corrections)U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials had put detainers on both suspects, which means they were suspected of being illegal immigrants, Fox Minneapolis reported at the time.Benitez said he waited in a car while Vergara went into the home with a duffel bag and duct tape. Minutes later, he was asked to go inside and saw Olander with his face covered and bound with the tape. As he struggled on the floor, Vergara allegedly struck Olander with a gun, Benitez told investigators. Vergara claimed there was a third person involved, but investigators ruled that out and cellphone records put both men at the crime scene.

""They're afraid, they go to analytics, and it gets difficult. ... He doesn't have that fear.""COLTS' JIM IRSAY 'GLAD' JEFF SATURDAY HAS NO HEAD COACHING EXPERIENCE IN NFL OR COLLEGEThe Colts' struggles since the unexpected early retirement of quarterback Andrew Luck have been well documented.Luck was a four-time Pro-Bowler who helped lead the Colts to four playoff appearances in his first six seasons.Since then, the team has started Jacoby Brissett, Brian Hoyer, Philip Rivers, Carson Wentz, Matt Ryan and Sam Ehlinger at the quarterback position. None of those options have panned out, and many began wondering if the Colts were planning to lose out in hopes of drafting a quarterback in April 2023.

But Irsay claimed that naming Saturday interim coach does not mean the team will stop playing to win games this season.""We’re in this thing; 9-7-1 get us in, no question about it. … We’re not tanking the season. Whoever says these things, that we’re not playing [quarterback] Matt [Ryan] because [of an effort to tank]… That’s not true. We’re going to do what it takes to win. I don’t know who people think we are. They don’t know us. We don’t tank in Indianapolis,"" Irsay said.COLTS' JEFF SATURDAY ADDRESSES COACHING EXPERIENCE CONCERNS: 'YOU DON’T THINK I’VE SEEN GREATNESS?'The hiring also raised flags as it relates to a potential loophole in the Rooney Rule. Saturday claimed his tenure would serve as a test case before the organization started searching for a head coach after the season.

 By
 Lori A Bashian | Fox News Facebook Twitter Flipboard Comments Print Email close Video Fox News Flash Top Entertainment Headlines of the Week Fox News Flash top entertainment and celebrity headlines are here.Octavia Spencer almost used prop money — with Ryan Reynolds' face on it — to make a purchase. During an appearance on ""The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon,"" the actress opened up about the time she nearly used the prop item from her upcoming Christmas musical ""Spirited"" when buying Halloween candy. Spencer joked with Fallon that she's happy she realized the money was fake before attempting to use it, admitting she ""could have gone to jail"" for using counterfeit bills.""I’m glad I’m one of those people who likes to be prepared, because I’m looking at the $100 bill, and I’m like, ‘Ben Franklin looks really, really weird.’ I realized it was a prop from ‘Spirited.’ And I almost paid with it,"" she explained. ""It’s a prop from the set, and I saw it on the floor and thought, ‘Wow, that’s great, it looks real.’ And I thought, because I never have money in my wallet, that I would remember.""In her defense, Spencer argued that it had been over a year since she filmed the movie and swiped the fake bill from set, saying it was natural for her to have forgotten.  
 Octavia Spencer almost used prop money to buy Halloween candy this year.
 (Matt Winkelmeyer/Getty Images)OCTAVIA SPENCER SAYS HER HOUSE IS HAUNTED BY GHOST OF LATE WESTERN MOVIE STAR: ‘HE IS MY PROTECTOR’The bill she was looking at had her co-star Reynolds' face on it, but looks similar to an average $100 bill because his hair is edited to look like the founding father's. Spencer revealed the fake bill is no longer in her wallet as she now keeps it on her bookshelf along with keepsakes from other sets she's worked on.In addition to Spencer and Reynolds, ""Spirited"" also stars Will Ferrell as the Ghost of Christmas Present. The movie is a twist on the classic Dickens story ""A Christmas Carol,"" but this time told from the point of view of the ghost, who begins to reexamine his life after he picks the wrong person as the Scrooge that year.Earlier this year, Reynolds spoke candidly about how difficult it was to prepare for his role in the musical, explaining he and the rest of the cast went to a seven-week theater camp to learn how to sing and dance, something Spencer also found difficult.""I had no idea what it takes to do a musical, because here is the thing, we all sing every day,"" the actress explained. ""I don’t consider myself a singer, but I thought I could probably do it, because when you’re singing with the radio, you sound so good right? You hit the notes, but you realize that you’re singing very low. They were going to have a microphone, so I thought I could use my little radio singing voice… and the voice coach Eric Vetro was like, ‘Yeah, I’m going to need you to sing out — project!'"" 
 ""Spirited,"" which stars, from left, Ryan Reynolds, Will Ferrell and Octavia Spencer, is a twist on ""A Christmas Carol,"" this time told from the Ghost of Christmas Present's point of view.
 (Dia Dipasupil/GA/The Hollywood Reporter via Getty Images)Spencer says she ""started panicking"" when he told her that and started wondering what she signed up for, because she thought she ""was going to walk around singing in (her) mouse voice"" the whole time.CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTERWhen Fallon asked if she is going to be hosting the holidays this year, Spencer admitted she doesn't think that is something anybody wants her to do.""I usually go home because it’s just easier for me, but in all honesty, nobody in my life would ever want me to host a party, only because I have to tap out early,"" she explained. ""I’m ready to be done before other people are, and if you’re hosting you can’t go, ‘Oh, guys, you know dinner is from 8:00 to 10:00, it’s 9:30.’""Spencer did claim that she is going to try to host next year, and will give everyone an update on how it goes. 
 Octavia Spencer doesn't host holidays at her home because she likes to go to bed early, and she can't do that as the host.

Inside the Boscos' flooded home. (EASTCOASTDIY / TIKTOK / FOX Weather)Floodwater poured into their home, eroded their backyard and ""popped out"" what was an in-ground pool.Given the level of destruction, the Boscos plan on bulldozing the house and bringing up the foundation to prepare the home for any future storms.HOW TO WATCH FOX WEATHER ON TV""We know we live in Florida,"" Cori Bosco said. ""We know a hurricane is bound to happen again, but we want to be prepared and plan ahead and plan the best that we can for something like this again."" In this photo, there is no division between the property and the Halifax River, which is connected to the Atlantic Ocean. (EASTCOASTDIY / TIKTOK / FOX Weather)The decision to bulldoze and rebuild from scratch was a difficult one, but the devastation caused by Nicole helped tip the scales.""This definitely sealed the deal, this last hurricane,"" Vinny Bosco said.Many other properties were destroyed during the storm. Erosion caused by Nicole’s relentless waves quickly dissolved the seaside foundation of homes, hotels and condos, fracturing the structures and eventually leading some sections to collapse into the sea. 04:39 'The back of the house was gone;' Property manager describes Florida beachfront homes lost to Nicole About 25 homes in Volusia County were deemed unsafe and some have even collapsed after Hurricane Nicole caused devastating erosion along the beach. Property Manager Krista Goodrich describes opening a door and seeing half of a home gone. Five deaths have also been attributed to Nicole. Two people were electrocuted by a power line downed by the storm, and two others died in a car crash. One man passed away while on his boat during the storm.

For one young man in Tarrytown, New York, honoring a local legend on Veterans Day was one of the most important things in his busy teen life.Eighth-grader Dylan Smith, 13, is passionate about several things: learning, history, scouting, LEGOs — and honoring veterans.""He is a leader and a doer, too,"" his mom, Laurie Smith, told Fox News Digital in a phone interview.VETERANS DAY AND ITS HISTORY: 6 KEY FACTS TO KNOWOn Veterans Day, Friday, Nov. 11, Dylan Smith took center stage as his Eagle Scout project — two benches honoring one very special veteran — were unveiled in front of the Sleepy Hollow Middle School in Sleepy Hollow, New York.That veteran, Armando ""Chick"" Galella, who died on Sept. 29, 2021, at age 100, is a ""legend"" in the adjacent communities of Tarrytown and Sleepy Hollow, said Laurie Smith.  
 Army veteran and Bronze Star Medal recipient Armando ""Chick"" Galella and Dylan Smith pictured together before Galella's passing on Sept. 29, 2021.
 (Laurie Smith)""All the children of the town knew him. He had this beautiful home in the middle of town and he was the grand marshal of every parade — you know, he's ‘that guy,’"" Laurie Smith added. ‘Chick’ Galella, local treasureGalella was born in 1921. The Sleepy Hollow native enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1940, according to a veteran profile of him on the National WWII Museum website.  After training, he was assigned to the 443rd Signal Corps at Hickam Air Force Base — and lived through the Dec. 7, 1941, attack on Pearl Harbor, the museum's site also noted.  VETERANS DAY IS NOT ALWAYS EASY FOR OUR HEROES – HERE'S WHAT TO SAY AND DOGalella served for five years in the Pacific theater in some of WWII’s ""bloodiest battles,"" the museum site said, including Guadalcanal, Leyte Gulf, Iwo Jima and Okinawa. He received the Bronze Star Medal for Meritorious Service and bravery in the Battle of Okinawa.

 (Family Handout)When he left the service in 1945, Galella had ""earned the highest rank an enlisted man can achieve"" — battalion sergeant major — the museum's site also said.Teen noticed how Galella honored othersYoung Dylan Smith was always moved by the fact that Galella, who lost his best friend, John J. Horan, at Pearl Harbor, stayed close with Horan's family — and particularly with Horan's mother, said Smith. So close were they that last year, just months before he passed, Galella had a Gold Star Mothers monument placed in Sleepy Hollow to honor Horan's mother, as well as all Gold Star Mothers.""It was dedicated on Mother’s Day,"" Smith said.

 Tyler Olson , Kelly Phares | Fox News Facebook Twitter Flipboard Comments Print Email close Video Georgia Senate race goes 'back to square one': Doug Collins Former Georgia Congressman Doug Collins says the Georgia senate runoff is less about endorsements and more about getting voters back to the polls.Senate Republicans won't delay their leadership elections set for next week despite a growing number of calls from conservative senators who want a postponement and are growing frustrated with Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and other leaders.""It makes no sense for Senate to have leadership elections before GA runoff,"" Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, tweeted Friday. ""We don’t yet know whether we’ll have a majority & Herschel Walker deserves a say in our leadership. Critically, we need to hear a specific plan for the next 2 yrs from any candidate for leadership.""Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., also tweeted Friday that the leadership vote ""should be postponed."" Sen. Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyo., tweeted in support of Rubio's proposition. So did Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., who has vocally opposed bringing McConnell back as the top Senate Republican.But a Senate GOP aide confirmed to Fox News Digital that elections will go on as planned.RUBIO CALLS FOR DELAY IN SENATE GOP LEADERSHIP ELECTIONS IN APPARENT SWIPE AT MCCONNELL 
 Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., is facing significant discontent from the right wing of his party. 
 (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)GOP Conference Chair John Barrasso likewise told Republicans the election would go forward, adding ""I expect a full and open discussion beginning at Tuesday's policy lunch on our path forward.""""I welcome the questions and points made in the letter circulated by Senators Rick Scott, Lee and Johnson,"" Barrasso wrote in a letter obtained by Fox News Digital. ""I too support a robust Conference discussion about our agenda, federal budgeting and spending, floor procedures, and other important priorities outlined prior to the elections and the beginning of the 118th Congress.""Former President Donald Trump has repeatedly called for McConnell, R-Ky., to be replaced as party leader.McConnell has been in uncomfortable positions within his party in recent years. He was in the minority of his party in voting for several pieces of legislation in the current Congress, including an infrastructure bill, a China competition bill and a gun control bill.GEORGIA RUNOFF: TRUMP FACTOR, SHORTENED SCHEDULE POSE CHALLENGES FOR WALKERThose votes are among the reasons multiple GOP Senate candidates said they would not vote for McConnell to have another term as leader, including Senator-elect Eric Schmitt, R-Mo.Sen.

Unlike House speaker elections, which require a majority of the chamber, senators elect their party leaders by a simple majority of the conference.It's not expected that enough members will come out in opposition to McConnell to oust him from his leadership post, and comments today made it appear unlikely that leadership elections would be postponed.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""Members are frustrated, and they’re looking for an outlet to have a conversation. There will be a robust discussion at lunch on Tuesday,"" at Senate GOP aide told Fox News Digital. ""There will also be a lot of questions about candidate quality/campaign priorities and mistakes. A lot of these will be directed at Scott, especially if the reports are true that he was preparing to challenge McConnell before Election Day had even concluded.""Fox News' Chris Pandolfo contributed to this report.

 Former Marine captain explains the benefits of hiring veterans Vets add value to a business, says capital markets vice president Facebook Twitter Comments Print Email By Jay Spoehel FOXBusiness close video Military job fair looks to help veterans find new careers Former U.S. Army special attack helicopter pilot Tim Best describes helping corporate companies create and strengthen their veteran recruiting programs. Former members of the military have a robust skill set that makes them valued team members to employers, says former Marine Corps Captain Jason Pandak. Those skills include flexibility, teamwork, task-orientation and team building.The vice president of capital markets at AmeriVet Securities told FOX Business the best way to honor veterans is to hire them. Pandak served three combat tours in Iraq. During this time, he spearheaded the establishment of the Iraqi Military Academy and guided more than 150 Marines through both peace and wartime missions. AmeriVet Securities is a dually registered service-disabled veteran-owned business and minority business enterprise founded by a Black, disabled veteran in 1994. ARMY VETERAN TURNS ‘GOLDEN TICKET’ INTO $40 MILLION BUSINESS The Marine Corps honor guard practices for a memorial ceremony held before the annual Veterans Day Parade Nov. 11, 2021 in Madison Square Park, New York City. (Andrew Lichtenstein/Corbis via Getty Images / Getty Images)FOX Business spoke with Pandak about the unique skills of those who proudly served their country.What veterans bring to the table in the corporate world""Veterans have had many formative experiences in dynamic situations at a young age, as opposed to many of their peers who start out in corporate America,"" Pandak said. This proven flexibility allows veterans to develop new skills and concepts at an accelerated pace. It also allows veterans to be resourceful when adapting to and overcoming challenges. The exposure to positions of authority from a young age as junior or non-commissioned officers also provides many veterans confidence when making decisions and a willingness to assume responsibility.THE HOME DEPOT FOUNDATION SURPRISES VETERANS WITH RENTAL, MORTGAGE PAYMENTSHow veterans differ in their approach to workVeterans are task-oriented and are experienced in deadlines, processes and protocols. Most of the time, they only need to be given instructions once and will generally retain that knowledge when needed to execute a project. Veterans will also go above and beyond to prove their worth in a corporate setting. They understand that when they transition out of the military, they may be a little behind the curve compared to peers from their age group. Because of this, they have an unrivaled initiative and ambition.The benefits of investing in veteran-run businesses""When you invest in a veteran-run business, you are investing in veterans, their well-being and their life post-military,"" Pandak said. ""It’s a way to show support for their service."" BPN founder and Army veteran Nick Bare appeared on ""Fox and Friends"" Sept. 14, 2022. (Fox News / Fox News)AMERICAN-MADE, VETERAN-OWNED BUSINESS BUILT ON ‘PATRIOTISM’What businesses should know about hiring veteransVeterans have unrivaled team-building skills and commitment to success. Veterans are also extremely loyal, being committed to their team and organization, which, Pandak believes, leads to retention and a higher return on investment for employers.""I know that many firms send their executive leadership teams to programs that mimic the Marine Corps Office Candidate School Leadership Reaction Course."" Pandak explained, ""Every single Marine goes through a version of the reaction course either at OCS or during their recruit training (boot camp). So, at 18-22 years old, we are ingraining the type of rapid decision-making skills many firms spend a lot of money to send their executive leaders to.""ILLINOIS VETERAN WHO LAUNCHED FIRE DEPARTMENT COFFEE LEAVES FIRE SERVICE TO RUN 'BREW' BUSINESSWhat the hiring process is like for veteransMany veterans come out of the military unfamiliar with effective job search strategies. They have most likely never been through an interview before.  Military recruiters are generally only trying to determine if a candidate meets basic physical and mental requirements because the staff at the military training facilities will teach them all they need to know. In addition, they have only been used to military recruiters contacting them to join. After they get out, no corporate recruiter is knocking on their door to hire them. Patricia Hicks, left, and Trish Fletcher of Manalapan, N.J., wave at participants as they march up Fifth Avenue during the Veterans Day Parade, Friday, Nov. 11, 2022, in New York. (AP Photo/Mary Altaffer / AP Images)Veterans may not be able to effectively distill their military experience and training into effective language on a resume or in an interview. It can be difficult for some to relate how their work as a soldier, sailor, marine or airmen relates to civilian employment.""Veterans are their worst self-advocate,"" according to Pandak, ""because the military is so team oriented, military service members are never taught to think of themselves as an individual or promote their own accomplishments.""POST-MILITARY RESUMES: TIPS FOR SERVICE MEMBERS ENTERING CIVILIAN WORKFORCEThe stigmas veterans face in the job search and how they can be overcome""Everyone has seen the movies, which portray veterans in stereotypes: a tobacco-chewing tattooed guy who can’t relate to civilians or speak in full sentences, or a PTSD-stricken veteran who is volatile and withdrawn from society."" Pandak said. ""In reality, veterans are extremely entrepreneurial and innovative.""Many join the military to develop leadership skills and come out excited to put their leadership skills to work. These veterans are usually very comfortable with, and crave, autonomy, Pandak says.Stigmas about hiring veterans ""can be overcome simply by supporting veterans and learning more about them. Veterans Day is a great opportunity for this; not all of them ‘wear their service on their sleeve,' if you will. If your organization has veterans, take the time to ask about their service, but also understand that while many veterans are proud of their service, they often do not want to be defined by it."" close video Veterans are 'givers and bring unbelievable skills to the workforce': Brian Rathjen Roberts & Ryan Investments President Brian Rathjen joins 'Mornings with Maria' to discuss Roberts & Ryan's mission to assist, support and 'give back' to veterans and how they are a great asset to the workforce.Where to find veterans if you want to hire themVeterans have rated ""finding work"" as the most challenging adjustment when leaving the service, and many struggle with unemployment. Pandak said in 2020 there were 581,000 unemployed veterans, 54% of them between the ages of 24 and 54.""One of the main reasons for this are the many barriers they face when gaining entry into the corporate workspace,"" the former captain said. Fortunately, there are veteran-specific headhunting firms like The Lucas Group, Bradley Morris and Orion Talent.GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HEREThere are also multiple nonprofit organizations like Hiring our Heroes and American Corporate Partners, which have networks of veterans looking for work.AmeriVet Securities, where Pandak works, is a service-disabled veteran-owned broker-dealer operating in the diversity and inclusion space in New York City.

 By
 Adam Sabes , Paul Steinhauser | Fox News Facebook Twitter Flipboard Comments Print Email close Video Fox News Go Fox News GoThe Fox News Decision Desk can project that Sheriff Joe Lombardo, a Republican, will become the next Governor of Nevada. He has unseated Democratic incumbent Steve Sisolak.The economy and inflation, education, crime, and the governor’s performance in dealing with the coronavirus pandemic were key issues in the gubernatorial campaign.Sisolak was elected governor in 2018 after spending nearly a decade as a Clark County Commissioner. Lombardo, after serving more than two decades in the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, was elected Clark County Sheriff in 2014. Clark County covers just 7% of the Nevada’s land area, but holds nearly three-quarters of the state’s population, making it by far Nevada’s most populous county.MIDTERM ELECTIONS 2022: LIVE UPDATES

""After four years of Steve Sisolak’s small business and job-killing policies, Governor-elect Lombardo’s unique perspective as a seasoned law enforcement officer and fiscal conservative will get the state moving in the right direction on behalf of all Nevada families. The RGA was proud to be a crucial partner in this race to elect Joe and fire Steve Sisolak. Our independent expenditure effort in Nevada was the largest in RGA history and we’re excited to have Joe joining our ranks."" Adam Sabes is a writer for Fox News Digital.

 Pete Rose speaks during a statue-dedication ceremony before a baseball game between the Cincinnati Reds and the Los Angeles Dodgers in Cincinnati, Ohio, on June 17, 2017.
 (AP Photo/John Minchillo, File)But he recently wrote a letter to MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred, asking to take him off baseball's ineligible list.""I have apologized many times, both for betting on baseball games while managing the Cincinnati Reds and then for denying that I did,"" he wrote. ""I am writing today for three reasons. First, because at my age I want to be 100% sure that you understand how much I mean it when I say that I’m sorry. Second, to ask for your forgiveness. And third, because I still think every day about what it would mean to be considered for the Hall of Fame.""Rose noted that he ""disappointed many Reds fans and baseball fans"" and ""it is among my greatest regrets that I let down fans who believed in me and who love baseball.""""You can't imagine how painful it is when I see my teammates from all the great teams I played on and players I played against go about their lives in ways I wanted to,"" Rose wrote. ""I want to be a part of that too and I know I probably never will. I am so grateful for the time I shared with them on and off the field. Nothing replaces it. People think you move on after you leave the game. You do in many ways. But the most important parts of baseball should grow even stronger. I screwed that up.

Like all of us, I believe in accountability. I am 81 years old and know that I have been held accountable and that I hold myself accountable. I write now to ask for another chance.""Rose was placed on baseball's permanently ineligible list by then-commissioner A. Bartlett Giamatti — who served just five months as MLB's commissioner before dying of a heart attack — in 1989, just one week before Giamatti's passing. He denied the claims for years but finally admitted to betting on baseball and Reds games in 2004. Rose had admitted he continues to bet on baseball, which has plagued him and his reinstatement hopes, but the Reds will open a BetMGM sportsbook in Great American Ball Park next year.Rose has made several appearances at MLB stadiums over the years since being banned, the first being when he was named to the All-Century Team in a pregame ceremony before Game 2 of the 1999 World Series. He also appeared in a celebration for the 25th anniversary of him becoming the Hit King in 2010, as well as the festivities for the 2015 All Star Game in Cincinnati.

In the 10 months I’ve been CBP’s Commissioner, I’ve gotten up to speed on the agency’s many complex areas of responsibility,"" Magnus said. ""While CBP is an operational — not a policy-making — agency, I’ve been closely involved in the major DHS immigration, border security, trade, and other policy discussions throughout my time as Commissioner. I frequently share insights from CBP’s frontline law enforcement and civilian personnel in those discussions and will continue to do so.""

 Kyle Morris , Andrew Murray | Fox News Facebook Twitter Flipboard Comments Print Email close Video Veterans, military families almost 40% more likely to be victim of cyber thieves Blue Star Families chapter president Jeff Chin and Aura chief marketing officer Kristin Covi explain why military members are more likely to be impacted by scammers and what they can do to protect themselvesEXCLUSIVE: Republican Rep. Don Bacon, who was re-elected to represent Nebraska's 2nd Congressional District on Tuesday, wants to improve the lives of veterans and active duty service members if the GOP wins back control of the House.In an interview with Fox News Digital on Friday, Bacon — who defeated his Democratic challenger, Tony Vargas, in Tuesday's election and served as a brigadier general and wing commander during his time in the Air Force — spoke about his efforts to enhance financial protections for junior enlisted men and women in the military.""We're seeing that our junior enlisted, because they're married, have to go on food stamps or [Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program] and I think that's a travesty,"" Bacon said. ""I hope in the next Congress I can be part of the team and work with [House Armed Services Committee ranking member] Mike Rogers to build that consensus. We have to adjust our enlisted pay because if pay is not keeping up with our junior ranks they're going to get out right away or just not get in.""""As Americans, having your junior enlisted on food stamps or SNAP, I think most people would say that's damn ugly,"" he added. ""We don't want it, right? We have to protect our junior enlisted and do a better job on it.""NEBRASKA REPUBLICAN DON BACON HOLDS ON TO US HOUSE SEAT, DEFEATING STATE SENATOR TONY VARGAS 
 Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., leaves the House GOP caucus meeting at the Capitol Hill Club in Washington on Tuesday, Sept. 20, 2022.
 (Bill Clark/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images)Bacon identified the junior enlisted members are the ""backbone"" of the armed forces, and are the ""ones who run the military.""""They put the bombs on the airplanes. They're the guys that are infantry and special forces, by and large,"" he said. ""There's no reason they should be on SNAP.""Bacon, who said he plans to lead efforts to increase pay for the junior enlisted if Republicans take back the House, insisted the fact that military men and women are relying on programs like SNAP and food stamps is ""an embarrassment for the greatest military in the world — the greatest country in the world.""In a Veterans Day message, Bacon praised the American way of life but warned that the freedoms enshrined in the nation must be secured.""We live in the greatest country in the world. We are so blessed with the freedoms that we have, the opportunity to climb that ladder of success. We're a nation based on law, the rule of law and inequality under the law. We're imperfect because we're human, but because of freedom of the press, freedom of speech, freedom to petition the government and assemble, when it's not right, we can make changes.""""War is not done. There's bad people out there — this will be a fact of our life until God returns,"" he added. ""We've got to have a good military, a good State Department. We've gotta be prepared for war. The more prepared you are, the less odds you have of having war.""

I had so much pressure to buckle, but I think it was the right bill.""""You gotta remember, Deb Fisher, one of my best friends, she voted for it in the Senate. [Iowa Republican Sen.] Chuck Grassley, who admire tremendously, voted for it,"" Bacon said. ""I thought it was a good bill. Now, there were some things added to it when we were in the minority. I think it went from an A bill to a B bill. But the reason I say that is because I was working on this when Trump was president — it was one of Trump's priorities, it was one of his bills. Just because it was good for President Trump and then ‘bad’ when Biden does it, I don't follow that. I'm an American first. I want America to succeed and this bill was good under Trump, it was good under Biden as far as I'm concerned.""Despite the additions Democrats made to the measure, Bacon said the infrastructure measure ""was still 95% a great bill"" and that he believes his district ""liked it.""Discussing Trump's influence over the Republican Party, Bacon said he believes it's about the policies and not so much about Trump himself.""What I see too much is ‘you got to love a man 100% or hate him 100%.’ Well, that's those are false choices,"" he said. ""I think it's fair to say I like [his] policies, but we need someone who's going to be respectful and decent and be a consensus builder.""

I've always enjoyed, liked him, and admired him. But I also think we have many folks. [South Carolina Sen.] Tim Scott is, I think, outstanding. He's got a national future ahead of him, I believe. And [Florida Gov. Ron] DeSantis has delivered. I think he's got self-control.""""Conservatives want to see someone who's been successful and can win a second term,"" Bacon added. ""DeSantis has shown that. I think we have some great folks out there."" Kyle Morris covers politics for Fox News. Story tips can be sent to kyle.morris@fox.com and on Twitter: @RealKyleMorris.

 By
 Charles Creitz | Fox News Facebook Twitter Flipboard Comments Print Email close Video TikTok is ‘China’s digital fentanyl’: Brendan Carr FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr unpacks lawmakers’ push to ban TikTok as concerns over national security and China’s involvement grow. The top Republican member on the Federal Communications Commission warned Chinese-owned app TikTok is the CCP's digital version of fentanyl.FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr dismissed claims the app within the United States is insulated from spying and national security implications by its Chinese parent.""At the end of the day, TikTok is China's digital fentanyl. A lot of people look at TikTok and think it's just a fun application for sharing dance videos or other funny videos. But that's just the sheep's clothing underneath of it – It operates as a very sophisticated surveillance app, and it's not the videos, but it's pulling everything from search and browsing history, potentially keystroke patterns, biometrics, including face prints, invoice prints,"" Carr said. ""And up to now, we've been told by TikTok officials, don't worry, all this is stored in the U.S. or stored outside of China. But this summer, there was a blockbuster story that said internal communications from Tik showed that everything is seen back in China.""TIKTOK'S PARENT COMPANY BYTEDANCE PLANNED TO TRACK AMERICANS' LOCATIONS THROUGH TIKTOK: REPORT 
 TikTok is among the most frequently downloaded social media apps worldwide, as well as in the United States — specifically among young users. 
 (CFOTO/Future Publishing via Getty Images)The report represents a risk in terms of espionage and other malign activity from the U.S.' chief rival and a country that purportedly seeks to replace America as the nation's lead economy.Carr said there have also been several reports of Chinese TikTok parent company Byte Dance attempting to surveil specific U.S. citizens through the app.Some of TikTok's content is curated to certain groups of people, Carr suggested, pointing to videos of the infamous ""blackout challenge"" targeted toward youth.""This was alleged in a court case, and [a 10-year-old] girl ended up strangling herself to death. So we're seeing very different content.""GROWING ‘SQUAD’ RIPPED FOR HAVING NO SOLUTIONS 
 China's President Xi Jinping addresses the press next to Argentina's President Mauricio Macri (not in frame) after a working meeting at the Olivos Presidential residence in Olivos, Buenos Aires on December 2, 2018. 
 (JUAN MABROMATA/AFP via Getty Images)The Biden administration is reportedly taking an investigatory but cautious tack toward restricting the app, according to Carr, who said the Treasury via the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) has been working to find a way for TikTok to operate domestically while remaining consistent with national security concerns.That itself shows a lack of trust in the app, he said, pointing to lawmakers who have purportedly told him they post TikTok videos from burner phones and from devices located outside of their federal offices.""This is a basic IQ test for the administration, I don't see a path forward technically where we can assure ourselves that the data isn't going to flow back to China and similarly that they're not going to use the algorithm for foreign influence campaigns here,"" he said.CLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPConcerns are bipartisan in this regard, as Carr cited Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Mark R. Warner, a Virginia Democrat, and vice chairman Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican, agreeing on much in that regard.Rubio, R-Fla., and Rep. Mike Gallagher, R-Wisc., said Thursday that they will introduce legislation to effectively ban TikTok in the United States, citing concerns that the social media app's popularity in the United States could give the Chinese Communist Party the ability to ""subtly indoctrinate American citizens"" and collect info on users. ""TikTok is a major threat to U.S. national security,"" the lawmakers wrote in the Washington Post. ""Unless TikTok and its algorithm can be separated from Beijing, the app’s use in the United States will continue to jeopardize our country’s safety and pave the way for a Chinese-influenced tech landscape here.""Fox Business' Paul Best contributed to this report.

 Larry Kudlow: Now is the time for the Republican Party to unite Do you want to Save America? Then Save Herschel Walker, Larry Kudlow says Facebook Twitter Comments Print Email By Larry Kudlow FOXBusiness close video Larry Kudlow: Donald Trump should pause political plans until the Georgia Senate runoff passes FOX Business host Larry Kudlow urges Americans and the Republican Party to support Georgia Senate candidate Herschel Walker in the December runoff on 'Kudlow.' Alright, tonight: ""Herschel First."" That's my message to the Republican Party. You're going to carry the House. You can pick up the Senate if Herschel Walker wins the runoff.  Now is not the time for all kinds of finger-pointing and blame-gaming. Now's the time for some party unity for a change, to push Herschel Walker over the goal line and into the end zone. The end zone is a GOP Senate with 51 votes. 51-49 might sound like a tight one, but in fact it would be a GOP landslide because all the committee chairs would go to Republicans. They will run the budget process: tax policy, permitting, border control, parental education and on and on. That's how important this is. You want to save America? Save Herschel.   Now, some really good news, Mitch McConnell has made an arrangement with Governor Brian Kemp, who will then loan his get-out-the-vote machine and his political team to the Herschel Walker operation for the December 6th runoff.  This is very big! Governor Kemp — one of the best operations in the country — and he himself just had a tremendous election victory, clobbering election denier Stacey Abrams, who will now presumably help America by retiring from politics. REPUBLICANS BLAMING TRUMP FOR ELECTION RESULTS ‘MOVING WAY TOO QUICK,’ MERCEDES SCHLAPP SAYS close video Trump is dividing Republicans by attacking Ron DeSantis: David Webb Fox News contributor David Webb discusses whether it's time to move on from Trump and how Herschel Walker can win Georgia on 'Varney & Co.'This is reported by several sources, Governor Kemp will transfer his door knocking, data analytics, phone banks and microtargeting programs to the Senate Leadership Fund, which is Mitch McConell's Super PAC that is supporting Walker.  The Super PAC will provide the funding, maybe a couple million dollars, maybe more, whatever is necessary for the effort and the Walker get-out-the-vote operation will be run by Kemp's top advisers and staffed by over 100 field workers. This was all reported at Politico, which I never entirely trust. Fox News, however, did confirm it and so have other media outlets.  I’m surprised it hasn’t gotten more play, but mostly the mass media wants to sit around blaming Donald Trump for everything that happened in the world including today’s rain.  Then, hopefully Herschel Walker will stay on message and he’ll talk about inflation, crime, the border, taking the handcuffs off of oil and gas. Mr. Walker will be here a bit later in the show and he’ll talk about all this, but I will say this is good news. It’s all good news.   Now, we are talking ""Save America,"" ""Make America Great Again,"" ""America First"" and frankly it all adds up to ""Herschel First."" In conversations I've had with leading Republicans around the country, just in the last, I don’t know, day or two, they will all be coming around descending in Georgia to help the ""Herschel First"" operation.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Republican challenger Herschel Walker blames inflation on Biden administration policies (Fox News)I think it would be terrific if my former boss Donald Trump put his own political plans on hold just until we get through the ""Herschel First"" operation — that’s December 6th — and a number of people, a number of leading politicians have talked to me and suggested the wisdom that President Trump would unlock a good chunk of his own PAC money to assist in the ""Herschel First"" operation. These are suggestions, but a number of GOP leaders have made them to me.  As you know, in recent evenings, I've been talking about the GOP platoon. We didn't quite get to cavalry status, but platoons have plenty of soldiers, a lot of clout, lots of staying power and they know how to move in the right direction. Platoons are of course always bigger and better than Squads. You know who I mean. So, this becomes the ""Herschel First"" platoon and that is my riff.  This article is adapted from Larry Kudlow's opening commentary on the November 11, 2022, edition of ""Kudlow.""  Markets Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Personal Finance MortgagesStudent LoansCredit CardsPersonal LoansSavingsInsurance401kRetirementTax PlanningEconomy Government SpendingMoney & PolicySmall BusinessInflationMarkets StocksUS MarketsCryptocurrencyFutures & CommoditiesBondsFunds & ETFsBusiness LeadersIndustriesRetailPre-MarketsWatchlist Lifestyle EntertainmentRich & FamousTravelCarsAirplanesFood & DrinksArtsReal Estate PersonalCommercialLuxury PropertiesTech DigitalSocial MediaGadgetsBusiness TechHealthcare TechFuture TechAISpaceSports NFLNBAMLBNASCARBoxingSoccerGolfTennisOpinion Shows Mornings with MariaVarney & CoCavuto: Coast to CoastMaking Money with Charles PayneThe Claman CountdownBulls & BearsThe Evening EditKennedyStrange Inheritance with Jamie ColbyMaria Bartiromo's Wall StreetWSJ at Large with Gerry BakerBarron's RoundtableAbout Channel FinderJobsTerms of UseUpdated Privacy PolicyFAQMedia RelationsCorporate InformationClosed Captioning PolicyAccessibility StatementFox NewsFox NationFox Business GoApps & Products Facebook Twitter Fox Business New Terms of Use New Privacy Policy Do Not Sell my Personal Information Help Closed Captioning Policy

 Facebook Twitter Instagram RSS Email Kevin McCarthy Published November 11, 2022 5:13pm EST Freedom Caucus discussing rival candidates for speaker amid standoff with McCarthy over House rules Minority Whip Steve Scalise and GOP vice chair Mike Johnson's names floated, though both officially back McCarthy 
 By
 Haris Alic , Tyler Olson | Fox News Facebook Twitter Flipboard Comments Print Email close Video Kevin McCarthy 'not concerned' about possible obstacles in bid for House Speaker Fox News' Chad Pergram provides details on Rep. Kevin McCarthy's effort to become Speaker of the House. The House Freedom Caucus is discussing rival candidates for speaker as it seeks to pressure Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy into giving legislative concessions in exchange for supporting his bid for speaker, which he has started making even before Republicans have locked up a majority. New and existing members of the Caucus have spent the past two days at a retreat in Washington, D.C., discussing how to approach the speaker election later this month. More hard-line members are pressing for the caucus to stand united in opposing McCarthy, R-Calif., on ideological grounds. ""Kevin McCarthy has done nothing in two years to earn my vote,"" said Rep. Bob Good, R-Va. Others, meanwhile, want to strike a deal with McCarthy on the House rules. The demanded changes are technical but would drastically reduce the House speaker's control over the legislative process.EX-TRUMP OFFICIALS WORKING TO BLOCK MCCARTHY'S SPEAKER BID 
 The House Freedom Caucus is discussing rival candidates for speaker as it seeks to pressure Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy into giving legislative concessions in exchange for its support.
 (Win McNamee/Getty Images)As the negotiations have yet to deliver a breakthrough, the Freedom Caucus has begun debating alternative candidates for speaker. Good, who was first elected in 2020, has been floated as a potential contender, but few see him as a legitimate opponent for McCarthy.Instead, the Freedom Caucus is weighing whether it could throw its unanimous support behind a challenger outside its rank. House GOP Whip Steve Scalise and GOP Vice Chair Mike Johnson, who already hold conference-wide posts, have been floated as possibilities. Both Scalise, R-La., and Johnson, R-La., are officially backing McCarthy's campaign for speaker and neither is officially courting the Freedom Caucus. Scalise, in fact, is already running for the number two spot of House majority leader.   Among the conservatives' demands are restoring the power to remove a speaker by a vote that could be called at any time; ensuring a floor vote on any amendment if 10% percent of the GOP conference cosponsors it; and reinstating a ""majority of the majority"" rule under which bills would only advance when supported by most GOP members. 
 ""Kevin McCarthy has done nothing in two years to earn my vote,"" said Rep. Bob Good, R-Va., who has been floated as a potential speaker candidate. (Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images)
 ""There's a point of leverage in these leadership votes,"" said House Freedom Caucus Chairman Scott Perry, R-Pa. ""We want to have a conversation, devoid of the politics about who is leading, on how the House should operate, how legislation should pass.""HOUSE FREEDOM CAUCUS WANTS OPTION OF REMOVING THE SPEAKER AS PRICE FOR GIVING MCCARTHY THE GAVELMcCarthy, who was prevented from ascending to the speakership in 2015 because of the Freedom Caucus, has not yet agreed to the changes wholesale. GOP leadership has similarly not agreed to move the internal conference election until after the formal rules are adopted later this month. A source close to the Freedom Caucus leadership said the discussions about alternative speaker candidates were still preliminary, and most of the group was focused on securing support from McCarthy for its rules overhaul. ""There's a fairly easy solution here,"" said the source. ""McCarthy can support popular reforms to decentralize the speaker's power and empower individual members, or he can roll the dice that someone else won't make that compromise and get the speaker's gavel.""  
 House GOP Vice Chair Mike Johnson, R-La., who is backing McCarthy, has been floated as possible speaker candidates by the Freedom Caucus.
 (Tyler Olson and Haris Alic/Fox News Digital)House leadership aides told Fox News Digital they expect McCarthy will cut a deal and give the Freedom Caucus at least a portion of what they want. They note that McCarthy has a nearly non-existent cushion of support to hit the 218 vote threshold needed to become speaker. At the moment, the potential Republican majority looks to be anywhere between 218 seats, the bare minimum needed to control the House, and 230 seats. The latter would constitute a sweep of all outstanding races, including some in which Democrats are favored, but still falls far short of the 60 seats McCarthy predicted could be possible under a GOP wave that never materialized. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPThe Freedom Caucus, which has more than two-dozen members, could be pivotal to getting McCarthy across the 218-vote threshold needed to become a speaker.McCarthy's office did not respond to requests for comment on this story.  Haris Alic is a politics reporter for Fox News Digital covering Congress.

 Facebook Twitter Instagram RSS Email Elon Musk Published November 11, 2022 4:00pm EST Journalists erupt on Elon Musk for saying 'media elite' preventing Twitter from 'elevating citizen journalism' More competition to mainstream media will increase their accuracy, Musk claimed 
 By
 David Rutz | Fox News Facebook Twitter Flipboard Comments Print Email close Video Howard Kurtz: Media thinks Elon Musk's free speech approach is going to ruin Twitter 'Media Buzz' host Howard Kurtz gives his take on Elon Musk's Twitter takeover on 'The Story.'Twitter owner Elon Musk wrote Friday that the ""media elite"" will do everything it can to prevent the goal of the platform elevating what he calls ""citizen journalism,"" and professional journalists fumed.""As Twitter pursues the goal of elevating citizen journalism, media elite will try everything to stop that from happening,"" he tweeted to his 115 million followers.""Mainstream media will still thrive, but increased competition from citizens will cause them to be more accurate, as their oligopoly on information is disrupted,"" Musk added.ELON MUSK'S TWITTER TAKEOVER MAKES THE LEFT LOSE IT: ‘IT’S LIKE THE GATES OF HELL OPENED'From critics poking the world's richest man for saying he wanted to take on elites to hitting him for suggesting the media would be improved by his changes to make the platform more democratic, Musk's latest Twitter missives drew a massive reaction.""Journalists are citizens,"" Condé Nast's Luke Zaleski wrote in response. ""The vast majority are middle and working class men and women doing difficult and important work. This obscene glutton and bully controls perhaps the most powerful combination of wealth and media reach in human history. And he's blaming so-called ‘elites.’"" ""Is this tweet from 2009?"" wrote Vox's Ryan McCarthy. ""It's almost like the last 12 years of Twitter - and the internet - didn't happen and now we're back to the democratization blather from social media's first era.""""Twitter apparently is pursuing the goal of being a 2003 blog post,"" Bill Scher quipped.ELON MUSK: ‘I RECOMMEND VOTING FOR A REPUBLICAN CONGRESS’The free speech advocate has said he wants to make Twitter a premier public square for sharing information and ideas, but Musk's rapid series of changes to the platform and mass layoffs have prompted an uproar among the tech and media establishments. Perhaps his most controversial move has been the $8 subscription option for so-called blue ""checkmarks,"" which were previously only given to certain established public figures.However, the program was suspended on Friday after a series of impersonators caused confusion online, such as a fake ""LeBron James"" account with a blue checkmark making some people think the NBA star had requested a trade from the Los Angeles Lakers. Another example was one appearing to be Rockstar Games promising a new edition of its popular ""Grand Theft Auto"" video game. 
 Elon Musk has wasted little time making his mark on Twitter since he took over last month.
 Musk has been vocal throughout the rapid changes to the platform on Twitter, at times cracking jokes and needling critics.""Please note that Twitter will do lots of dumb things in coming months. We will keep what works & change what doesn’t,"" he wrote Wednesday.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP""I love when people complain about Twitter… on Twitter,"" Musk wrote, including a laughing emoji.

 By
 Ryan Morik | Fox News Facebook Twitter Flipboard Comments Print Email close Video Dallas Cowboys and Green Bay Packers prepare for showdown in NFL week 10 FOX Sports lead NFL analyst Greg Olsen previews the Dallas Cowboys-Green Bay Packers matchup and weighs in on whether the Cowboys will try to sign free agent Odell Beckham Jr.Now that he's getting closer to 100% health, the pitches for free agent Odell Beckham Jr. have begun.The Dallas Cowboys have put their name in the hat. Jerry Jones said the Cowboys logo would look good on the receiver, while Micah Parsons recently tweeted to Beckham, telling him to ""talk to me.""But one of Beckham's former teammates may have a recruiting advantage. ""I don't have to tweet at him"" New York Giants running back Saquon Barkley told reporters Friday.CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM 
 Odell Beckham (13) and teammate Saquon Barkley (26) of the New York Giants greet each other during warmups against the Carolina Panthers at Bank of America Stadium Oct. 7, 2018, in Charlotte, N.C.  
 (Streeter Lecka/Getty Images)Beckham and Barkley only spent one year (2018) as teammates in New York. After Barkley's rookie season, the Giants traded Beckham to the Cleveland Browns after he completed the first year of a five-year deal. Despite playing in just 12 games together, the pair have remained close friends.Beckham became an overnight sensation with the Giants. After his one-handed catch against the Cowboys on Sunday Night Football, he quickly reached superstar status and became one of the top receivers in the NFL.Injuries and poor quarterback play plagued him from 2017 to 2021 until he was released by the Browns. He looked like his vintage self en route to winning a Super Bowl with the Los Angeles Rams. Had he not torn his ACL in that game, he might have been the game's MVP.""Like I’ve said before, he’s a heck of a player. I’m more just not saying words, more focused on him just continuing to attack his rehab, get ready. He’s a special player, and he’s still got a lot left in the tank,"" Barkley said. ""I know how he is already with his mindset, going at this rehab. And when he’s able to come back, he’s gonna show his skill set.""When he’s healthy, he’s one of the best players in the league. So why wouldn’t anybody want him on their team."" 
 Teammates Odell Beckham Jr. (13) and Saquon Barkley (26) of the New York Giants celebrate after Beckham Jr. throws a touchdown to Barkley during a game at Bank of America Stadium Oct. 7, 2018, in Charlotte, N.C. 
 (Streeter Lecka/Getty Images)Beckham stirred controversy with his antics in New York and was hated by some Giants fans just as much as he was beloved by others. But now that he's matured and gotten some winning under his belt, Barkley thinks Beckham returning could have a happy ending.""I feel like there’s not really a sales pitch. It’s New York. It’s the Giants,"" Barkley said. ""Obviously, he has familiar faces within this facility and the locker room, and, personally, I think it would be a great story to come back to a place that you were at before and continue to help build success.""Barkley and the Giants have been a pleasant surprise in the NFL with their 6-2 record. This comes despite plenty of injuries to an already questionable receiving core. Kenny Golladay has been a huge disappointment when he's been on the field. They also lost Sterling Shepard to a torn ACL. After injuries continued to hinder him, they traded second-year receiver Kadarius Toney to the Kansas City Chiefs. 
 Odell Beckham (13) of the New York Giants celebrates with Saquon Barkley (26) after scoring a 20-yard touchdown against the San Francisco 49ers during a game at Levi's Stadium Nov. 12, 2018, in Santa Clara, Calif. 
 (Ezra Shaw/Getty Images)The former second overall pick also struggled in recent years with myriad injuries. But, this season, Barkley has looked like his 2018 and 2019 self. He's on pace for 1,655 rushing yards, which would shatter his career-high of 1,307 his rookie season. His 779 rushing yards so far are the second-most he's had during any eight-game stretch in one season.Considering Barkley's play combined with the new coaching staff putting Daniel Jones in a place to succeed and a fine defense, it would be disappointment to fans if the Giants failed to reach the playoffs. It's another reason why Beckham might look good in East Rutherford.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPIn 12 games with the Rams, including the playoffs, last season, Beckham had 48 catches for 593 yards and seven touchdowns. But it was in the playoffs where he truly showed his value. In those four games, he had 21 receptions for 288 yards and two scores. In the NFC championship game, he had nine catches for 113 yards. And before he tore his ACL in the second quarter of the Super Bowl, he had two catches for 52 yards and the game's first touchdown.The Giants will host the 1-6-1 Houston Texans Sunday afternoon.

The patriarch served for 20 years in the Navy.There’s one person who comes to Kathie Lee Gifford’s mind on Veterans Day.Her father, Aaron Epstein, reported for duty the day after Pearl Harbor. He went on to serve 20 years in the Navy. His stepfather, as well as his oldest brother, were both killed in combat in Europe. His other sibling came home wounded. The patriarch was the only one from his family who came home unscathed physically.Epstein passed away in 2002 at age 78 from Lewy body dementia.""I grew up in a Navy home,"" the former co-host of ""Today"" told Fox News Digital. ""My daddy is one of those people, like so many, when Pearl Harbor happened, he was just 17 years old and lied about his age. That’s the only bad thing he ever did.… He lied about his age and wanted to be a pilot, but I think his eyesight wasn’t that great, and he had flat feet or something like that. And so he went into the Navy … [he] ended up actually in Paris, France, early on in his naval career on General Eisenhower’s staff after World War II at Shape Headquarters. And that’s why I was born in Paris, France.""'SPICE GIRLS' MEL B, JAMIE LYNN SPEARS AND MORE LEARN LIMITS BY SPECIAL FORCES OPERATIVES ON SURVIVAL SHOW

""He lost relatives during the Holocaust, but he was so grateful to live in a country like America, where freedom lives. And I pray to God we continue to have freedom.… Veterans Day, of course, is for the ones who served and serve faithfully. ""My father’s stepfather also died during World War II, along with his brother Paul, and then his other older brother, Carl, was wounded. And so, we just don’t understand in our world today the kind of sacrifice that was made … war is ugly, but the sacrifices and the bravery and the devotion to a cause – there are beautiful things to find, even in the ugly struggle of it.""CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER

And he continues to inspire her to honor our troops.""I have such respect,"" she said. ""And no matter where I am, if I see somebody in uniform, I go and I thank them.

An investigation into Wing was launched Sept. 19 after she wrote on Twitter she was ""exhausted with these White folx,"" among other statements.The Pentagon originally told Fox News Digital that the matter would be referred to Under Secretary of Personnel and Readiness Gil Cisneros for a final decision 30 days after the initial review. But, after nearly two months, the case is unresolved. ""The findings are being presented to the office of the under secretary of defense for personnel and readiness,"" Cmdr. Nicole Schwegman, a DoD spokesperson, told Fox News Friday. ""Our focus remains on ensuring military-connected students, their families and our employees have equitable access to opportunities and resources that support student achievement and readiness for college and careers.

 By
 Christine Rousselle | Fox News Facebook Twitter Flipboard Comments Print Email close Video Featured Friend: Joey Jones spends the day with former Navy SEAL Jocko Willink Fox News' Joey Jones spends the day and hits the gym with retired Navy SEAL Jocko Willink on 'Fox & Friends' 'Featured Friend' segment.Quawnishia Morgan, 41, knew from an early age while growing up in Baltimore, Maryland, that she was destined for the military. Today, as a veteran, she also has definite ideas about Veterans Day and what it means — and what it should mean. ""I come from a family with a lot of children in the house,"" she told Fox News Digital by phone.""My parents were foster parents — so it was pretty obvious there wasn't an abundance of money to go around to fund college education and things like that.""VETERANS DAY AND ITS HISTORY: 6 KEY FACTS TO KNOWA talented singer, she also knew the music industry was a tough one to break into and a very unsteady career path at that.‘Finally realized my passion’In high school, she joined Navy ROTC, a move that ""really finalized my passion for what I wanted to do and where I wanted to go in life,"" she said. 
 Quawnishia Morgan, who grew up in Baltimore, knew early on that she was destined for the military, though she considered a career in music, too.
 (Quawnishia Morgan)""I joined the military for two reasons. One reason was to get away from home, first and foremost,"" she said. ""The second reason was basically to solidify a future for myself,"" she said. ""Although I felt I was good enough to be a singer, that wasn't a sure plan.""Morgan served in the Navy as an aviation storekeeper. When she first joined, she did not even know there was an aviation division. VETERANS DAY: 5 THINGS TO DO AND SAY TO HONOR AMERICA'S HEROES""I knew I wanted to go in the Navy — but I didn't necessarily know what I wanted to do because I don't come from a family with heavy military influence,"" Morgan said. Working in a military-adjacent role has brought back ""a sense of connection and pride [in] the military and back to my sisters and brothers [who] wore the same uniform I wore."" Now living in Virginia, Morgan said she initially wanted to join the Air Force, yet ran into roadblocks when she learned she'd have to take additional exams. ""I was just so eager to get out there and be on my own and be independent,"" she said. When the recruiter told her the Navy had an aviation side, she knew that's what she wanted to do.  
 The aviation storekeepers were ""in charge of all the supplies and equipment as well as ordering military uniforms, aircraft parts and things like that, even down to pens and pencils,"" said Quawnishia Morgan.
 (Quawnishia Morgan/AP Images)At the time, the Navy allowed recruits to determine the role they were suited for best. Morgan first tried to be an air framer — ""someone who works on the outside of an aircraft."" That didn't work out; Morgan now says she ""could never imagine"" doing that role.Her next job was a much better fit. ""I landed in supply, which then were called ‘aviation storekeepers,'"" she said. Aviation storekeepers are ""in charge of all of the supplies and equipment, as well as ordering military uniforms, aircraft parts and things like that, even down to pens and pencils.""""That's all I ever wanted, to still really serve and be a part of that process for people who wear the uniform."" ""So you were pretty much the supply house for the entire unit,"" she explained. While in the Navy, she met the man who would become her husband. After four years, she left active duty but quickly felt an ""emptiness."" VETERAN SUICIDE PREVENTION WORK NEEDS 'FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE,' SAYS MISSION ROLE CALL — HERE'S HOWMorgan re-enlisted in the Navy Reserve and served an additional three years. Civilian life proved challenging for Morgan. She worked ""jobs that I was less passionate about"" compared to her military service, she said.Eventually, she landed at ADS, a company that supplies military gear and tactical equipment to the U.S. military. She said that working in a military-adjacent role has brought back ""a sense of connection and pride [in] the military and back to my sisters and brothers [who] wore the same uniform that I wore."" 
 While in the Navy, Quawnishia Morgan served as an aviation storekeeper. In that role, storekeepers ""were pretty much the supply house for the entire unit,"" she said.
 (Quawnishia Morgan)""And that's what ultimately allowed me to separate from the military, because I stopped chasing it in uniform services, and I was actually content and happy with my place at ADS,"" she said. ""I still, even now, am in the supply industry and in the supply sector — and I still have military members relying on me to get their gear to them.""""Sometimes people just need to stop and listen and be more observant. And they can learn a lot."" ""That's all I ever wanted, to still really serve and be a part of that process for people who wear the uniform. So it's very, very rewarding for me.""Veterans Day means a lot to all who have servedNow, as a veteran, Morgan said that Veterans Day is ""super, super important"" and she wishes society had a broader view about what a ""veteran"" actually is. ""I think oftentimes when people think about Veterans Day, they only think about the members [who] fought wars, or they only think about the retirees,"" Morgan said.  
 A veteran is ""anybody who served their country under honorable conditions,"" said Morgan, a Navy veteran herself.
 (AP Photo/Alex Brandon, Pool)""But for me, Veterans Day is for anyone who chose to wear the uniform and served their enlistment. And whether they left [the service] or retired — as long as they served under honorary conditions, to me, that's a veteran.""She said that even today, people will see her car with its veteran tags and assume it belongs to someone else. VETERAN OF US ARMY REGAINS ABILITY TO MOVE FINGERS WITH NEW PROCEDURE, PROSTHETICS: HOPE FOR ‘NORMAL’ FUTURE""People in society just have these mixed feelings of what a veteran is supposed to look like,"" said Morgan.

 Facebook Twitter Instagram RSS Email Media Published November 11, 2022 4:27pm EST Twitter manager vomited into trash can after being told by Elon Musk to fire people: Report The New York Times devoted eight reporters and almost 2,600 words to investigating Musk's first few weeks at Twitter 
 By
 Scott Whitlock | Fox News Facebook Twitter Flipboard Comments Print Email close Video Howard Kurtz: Media thinks Elon Musk's free speech approach is going to ruin Twitter 'Media Buzz' host Howard Kurtz gives his take on Elon Musk's Twitter takeover on 'The Story.'The New York Times on Friday devoted eight reporters and 2,598 words to investigating Elon Musk’s first few weeks after buying Twitter. The big takeaway? Twice, the paper told readers that the billionaire’s moves resulted in vomit. Writers Kate Conger, Mike Isaac, Ryan Mac and Tiffany Hsu (with additional interviews by Kevin Roose, Lauren Hirsch, Kitty Bennett and David McCabe) authored a largely negative piece, noting the throw-up early in the story. They explained, ""One engineering manager, upon being told to cut hundreds of workers, vomited into a trash can. Others slept in the office as they worked grueling schedules to meet Mr. Musk’s orders.""Returning to this point later in the article, the journalists repeated, ""One engineering manager was approached by Mr. Musk’s advisers — or ‘goons,’ as Twitter employees called them — with a list of hundreds of people he had to let go. He vomited into a trash can near his feet.""BIDEN TORCHED OVER CALL TO INVESTIGATE ELON MUSK'S FOREIGN TIES: 'ONE OF THE MOST HYPOCRITICAL STATEMENTS' 
 Many on the left are sounding the alarm about Elon Musk’s potential Twitter takeover. 
 (FOX)Promising an exhaustive deep dive into the social media company, they described the impact of Musk’s purchase: ""The fallout has often been excruciating, according to 36 current and former Twitter employees and people close to the company, as well as internal documents and workplace chat logs.""Regarding potential layoffs, Conger, Isaac, Mac and Hsu noted that the tech executive refused to factor ""diversity and inclusion"" into his actions: ""Twitter executives also suggested assessing the lists for diversity and inclusion issues so the cuts would not hit people of color disproportionately and to avoid legal trouble. Mr. Musk’s team brushed aside the suggestion, two people said."" The Times recounted how the layoff plan developed: ""On Oct. 28, hours after completing his $44 billion buyout of Twitter the night before, Mr. Musk gathered several human-resource executives in a ‘war room’ in the company’s offices in San Francisco. Prepare for widespread layoffs, he told them, six people with knowledge of the discussion said. Twitter’s work force needed to be slashed immediately, he said."" Ultimately, Musk let go of 50 percent of the staff. CAN MUSK MILK TWITTER USERS FOR CASH WHILE BANNING ‘HATE AND HARASSMENT’? 
 The New York Times recently sounded the alarm with a warning that a red wave could be on the horizon, and things could quickly become ""dire"" for Democrats. 
 (DON EMMERT/AFP via Getty Images)The writers also explained that lunch at the company would no longer be free: ""Mr. Musk plans to begin making employees pay for lunch — which had been free — at the company cafeteria, two people said."" Bringing politics into the story, the reporters said of the recent midterm elections: ""Misinformation proliferated on the platform during Tuesday’s midterm elections."" In 2020, Twitter famously censored the New York Post’s laptop expose on Hunter Biden. The executive behind that move, Yoel Roth, resigned on Thursday. Conger, Isaac, Mac and Hsu noted his departure, but there was no mention of his censorship efforts.  
 Twitter has put up fact checks on government tweets in recent days.
 ((AP Photo/Matt Rourke, File)CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPHighlighting outside corporate pressure, the Times journalists said, ""Brands including Volkswagen Group, General Motors and United Airlines have said they will pause advertising on Twitter as they evaluate Mr. Musk’s ownership of the platform.""  Scott Whitlock is an editor for Fox News Digital.

 Facebook Twitter Instagram RSS Email Elon Musk Published November 11, 2022 4:00pm EST Journalists erupt on Elon Musk for saying 'media elite' preventing Twitter from 'elevating citizen journalism' More competition to mainstream media will increase their accuracy, Musk claimed 
 By
 David Rutz | Fox News Facebook Twitter Flipboard Comments Print Email close Video Howard Kurtz: Media thinks Elon Musk's free speech approach is going to ruin Twitter 'Media Buzz' host Howard Kurtz gives his take on Elon Musk's Twitter takeover on 'The Story.'Twitter owner Elon Musk wrote Friday that the ""media elite"" will do everything it can to prevent the goal of the platform elevating what he calls ""citizen journalism,"" and professional journalists fumed.""As Twitter pursues the goal of elevating citizen journalism, media elite will try everything to stop that from happening,"" he tweeted to his 115 million followers.""Mainstream media will still thrive, but increased competition from citizens will cause them to be more accurate, as their oligopoly on information is disrupted,"" Musk added.ELON MUSK'S TWITTER TAKEOVER MAKES THE LEFT LOSE IT: ‘IT’S LIKE THE GATES OF HELL OPENED'From critics poking the world's richest man for saying he wanted to take on elites to hitting him for suggesting the media would be improved by his changes to make the platform more democratic, Musk's latest Twitter missives drew a massive reaction.""Journalists are citizens,"" Condé Nast's Luke Zaleski wrote in response. ""The vast majority are middle and working class men and women doing difficult and important work. This obscene glutton and bully controls perhaps the most powerful combination of wealth and media reach in human history. And he's blaming so-called ‘elites.’"" ""Is this tweet from 2009?"" wrote Vox's Ryan McCarthy. ""It's almost like the last 12 years of Twitter - and the internet - didn't happen and now we're back to the democratization blather from social media's first era.""""Twitter apparently is pursuing the goal of being a 2003 blog post,"" Bill Scher quipped.ELON MUSK: ‘I RECOMMEND VOTING FOR A REPUBLICAN CONGRESS’The free speech advocate has said he wants to make Twitter a premier public square for sharing information and ideas, but Musk's rapid series of changes to the platform and mass layoffs have prompted an uproar among the tech and media establishments. Perhaps his most controversial move has been the $8 subscription option for so-called blue ""checkmarks,"" which were previously only given to certain established public figures.However, the program was suspended on Friday after a series of impersonators caused confusion online, such as a fake ""LeBron James"" account with a blue checkmark making some people think the NBA star had requested a trade from the Los Angeles Lakers. Another example was one appearing to be Rockstar Games promising a new edition of its popular ""Grand Theft Auto"" video game. 
 Elon Musk has wasted little time making his mark on Twitter since he took over last month.
 Musk has been vocal throughout the rapid changes to the platform on Twitter, at times cracking jokes and needling critics.""Please note that Twitter will do lots of dumb things in coming months. We will keep what works & change what doesn’t,"" he wrote Wednesday.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP""I love when people complain about Twitter… on Twitter,"" Musk wrote, including a laughing emoji.

Unfortunately, Dixon did not have that luxury.""With almost no cash on hand and hard work to be done to gain the trust of the Party’s grassroots, Dixon had to start from scratch while Gretchen Whitmer and allies were sitting on tens of millions of dollars, of which they immediately deployed, blasting Dixon on statewide TV, digital, and radio throughout, early and often,"" it concluded.The memo came after the lackluster 2022 midterm elections, which saw Republicans underperform in a year when a red wave was expected.That red wave did not come, save for in Florida and parts of New York, and control of Congress has yet to be decided in both chambers.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPDixon was unable to unseat Whitmer in the midterm elections that took place Tuesday.The Michigan Republican did not respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

(Credit: Portsmouth Police Department)A Virginia woman who was found guilty earlier this year of murdering her mother and sister will receive a new trial after officials discovered a juror had taken ""inappropriate actions,"" according to a local affiliate report. Megan Hargan was convicted in March and sentenced to life behind bars for two counts each of first-degree murder and use of a firearm in the commission of a murder, Fairfax County Commonwealth’s Attorney Steve Descano announced at the time. But just this week, a judge reversed course and granted Hargan a retrial after finding that a juror had acted inappropriately during the original proceedings, FOX 5 D.C. reported. According to the report, one of the members of the jury tried to re-enact the alleged crime with their own, unloaded rifle and later recalled the experience to the other jurors.VIRGINIA WOMAN FOUND GUILTY OF MURDERING MOTHER, SISTER THEN STAGING SCENE 
 Megan Hargan was originally sentenced to life in prison after staging a murder-suicide in her mother's and sister's deaths. 
 (FCPD)A spokesperson for Descano’s office, which appears to be closed for the Veterans Day holiday, did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital’s request for comment on Friday. In a statement provided to FOX 5, Descano wrote that he was ""disappointed that a juror’s inappropriate actions led to this double murder conviction being vacated. MISSING CALIFORNIA TEEN TRINITY BACKUS LEFT HOME WITHOUT SHOES, HASN'T BEEN HEARD FROM SINCE, FAMILY SAYS""We are still committed to getting justice for the victims of this crime,"" he said. ""My office will move forward and prepare for the new trial.""Prosecutors argued that Hargan killed her mother, 63-year-old Patricia Hargan, and her 23-year-old sister, Helen Hargan, in 2017 and then staged the scene to look like a murder-suicide. The victims, who lived together, were found to have suffered gunshot wounds to their heads. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPPolice investigated for 16 months before announcing that Megan Hargan had actually committed the murders.

 Facebook Twitter Instagram RSS Email Fox News Car Reviews Published November 11, 2022 3:19pm EST Review: The 2022 Elantra N is Hyundai’s hot rod High performance compact sedan is a blast 
 By
 Gary Gastelu | Fox News Facebook Twitter Flipboard Comments Print Email close Video Review: 2022 Hyundai Elantra N Hyundai's hot rod.Hyundai has injected a little muscle into its smallest sedan.The 2022 Hyundai Elantra N is a high performance version of the compact model that swaps its humble and hybrid powertrain options for a fire-breathing turbocharged four-cylinder engine.The 2.0-liter motor is rated at 276 horsepower, nearly twice that of the entry-level Elantra's engine.The Elantra N even comes standard with a sporty six-speed manual transmission at its starting price of $33,245, but an eight-speed automatic is available for $1,500.THE MOST EFFICIENT GASOLINE-POWERED VEHICLE MIGHT SURPRISE YOU 
 The Elantra N is a front-wheel-drive performance car.
 (Hyundai)That’s the only item on the options list as the Elantra N is fully loaded, making it one of the best bargain sports cars, let alone sports sedans, on sale today. 
 Updates include performance tires and brakes, plus aggressive bodywork.
 (Hyundai)Upgrades from the standard Elantra include a sport-tuned suspension with computer-controlled adjustable shocks, 19-inch wheels shod in Michelin Pilot Sport 4S high performance tires, an aggressive body kit with a wing on the trunk lid designed to improve aerodynamics and cooling, plus red cross bracing tubes mounted in the trunk behind the rear seats that makes the chassis stiffer. 
 The Elantra N is equipped with a cross brace behind the rear seats to stiffen the chassis.
 (Hyundai)The interior features a set of hard-shell racing-style front buckets, blue stitching specific to the model and both an instrument cluster and infotainment system equipped with performance data screens, such as acceleration timers and power output monitors. 
 The interior comes with sport seats and blue stitching.
 (Hyundai)The Elantra N can accelerate to 60 mph in less than six seconds, a feat it facilitates with a launch control system. In cars with the manual transmission, you engage the N drive mode setting and floor the throttle to hold the engine at a programmable RPM level, then let go of the clutch as the traction management system wrangles the power. The experience is harsh, with a big wheel slip followed by the tires gaining purchase and the engine bogging down as it rockets the car away. Not having tried the automatic model, I can’t say if it reacts the same way.REVIEW: THE 2023 HYUNDAI PALISADE WAS REBOOTED FOR THE BETTERSlowing down is made easier by a set of relatively enormous 14.2-inch front brake discs and a rev-matching function that automatically blips the throttle on downshifts to smooth out the gear changes. The latter can be turned on and off via a big red button on the steering wheel, depending on how manual of a mood you’re in. In automatic transmission cars the button activates an N Grin Shift mode that increases the turbo's boost and power to 286 hp for short bursts. The Elantra N sounds like bombs bursting in air, too. In N mode the exhaust makes the sort of snap, crackle, boom noises you just know the neighbors won't complaint about at all. 
 Performance screens provide data and allow the driver to adjust many of the car's settings.
 (Hyundai)The car can also pump synthetic motor noise into the cabin through the speakers to amp things up. The volume is adjustable and there is a setting that mimics the sound of one of Hyundai’s TCR racing cars. An equalizer allows you to further modify the tone, which is more of a drone when you’re just cruising along and better left turned off, but can be fun to use during moments of spirited driving.CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTERA custom drive mode lets you dial in all the parameters to your liking, including suspension stiffness, steering feel and how much drifting is allowed before the electronic stability control kicks in. 
 The 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine is rated at 276 horsepower.
 (Hyundai)The Elantra N has as much go as it does show and is definitely suited for an autocross event or a track day, but remains a mostly comfortable daily driver with the suspension is in its softest setting. The paper-thin tires deliver strong impacts on potholed and rutted roads, however. Rear seat passengers are provided with plenty of legroom for a car this size, and a full suite of electronic driver aids including lane-centering adaptive cruise control and automatic emergency brakes is standard.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPFuel economy comes in at 25 mpg combined and 31 mpg on the highway. That’s no match for the Elantra hybrid’s 54 mpg combined and 56 mpg highway ratings, but the hybrid is no match for the N at anything else.----------2022 Hyundai Elantra NBase price: $33,245Type: 5-passenger, 4-door, front-wheel-drive sedanEngine: 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinderPower: 276 hp, 289 lb-ftTransmission: 6-speed manualMPG: 22 city/31 hwy Gary Gastelu is Fox News Digital's automotive editor.

 (AP Photo/Mark J. Terrill)Kershaw has called Dodger Stadium home since his MLB debut in 2008. Since then, Kershaw has arguably been the best pitcher of his generation. He has three Cy Young Awards and an MVP to his name, and he has been a Cy Young Award finalist six times. He has been named an All-Star nine times and earned his first All-Star Game start over the summer at Dodger Stadium. He led the majors in ERA in each season from 2011 to 2014 and led the National League in WHIP in each of those seasons (his WHIP was the lowest in all of baseball in ‘13 and ’14). He and the Dodgers won the World Series in 2020, and he's also led the NL in strikeouts three times.

The other seven (Tom Seaver, Walter Johnson, Pedro Martinez, Bob Gibson, Cy Young, Tim Keefe and Christy Mathewson) are all Hall of Famers. Kershaw also is one of eight starting pitchers with at least 12 seasons of an ERA no higher than 3.00.Kershaw has not made 30 starts since the 2015 season, but he has proven to be his vintage self when healthy. In 22 starts in 2022, he pitched to a 2.28 ERA, his best mark in a 162-game season since his 1.69 mark in 2016, when he made 21 starts.

 Facebook Twitter Instagram RSS Email Midterm Elections Published November 11, 2022 2:25pm EST Midterms reconfirm evangelical voters' connection to GOP Evangelicals and Catholics comprised large blocs of supporters for pro-life measures and conservative candidates Associated Press Facebook Twitter Flipboard Comments Print Email close Video Fox News Flash top headlines for November 11 Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.In the midterm elections, evangelical Christians across the nation reconfirmed their allegiance to conservative candidates and causes, while Catholic voters once again showed how closely divided they are -- even on abortion.On a successful, high-profile ballot measure in the battleground state of Michigan, proposing to enshrine abortion rights in the state constitution, Catholic voters split about evenly, according to AP VoteCast, an expansive survey of more than 94,000 voters across the country.In Kentucky, a reliably Republican state, voters rejected a GOP-backed ballot measure aimed at denying any state constitutional protections for abortion. Among those voting No were 60% of Catholic voters, according to VoteCast.BALLOT INITIATIVES PROTECTING ACCESS TO ABORTION WIN ACROSS FIVE STATES IN MIDTERMSIn contrast, about two-thirds of white evangelical voters in both Kentucky and Michigan voted against protecting abortion access.Albert Mohler, president of Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville, Kentucky, said rejection of that measure in his state was an ""unmitigated disaster.""He was less surprised by abortion-rights amendments passing in more liberal Vermont and California and centrist Michigan. But the Kentucky vote was the ""hardest loss"" and followed a similar vote in August in another red state, Kansas.Mohler said it's important for abortion opponents to be willing to enact their views into policy.Voters ""who voted for pro-life candidates turned around and voted against a pro-life constitutional amendment,"" Mohler lamented.On the opposite side of the fight, Catholics for Choice president Jamie Manson said abortion access protections are popular.""In red states and blue states, with religious voters and secular voters, wherever abortion was on the ballot, abortion rights disproportionately won,"" she said in a statement.John Fea, a professor of American history at Messiah University in Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania, said the Kentucky vote signaled that many Americans seem to want the status quo provided under the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision. It legalized abortion nationwide — with some limits — until it was overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court in June.""Most of the country wants some restrictions on abortion, but they don’t want bans,"" Fea said. ""The Christian right, despite the fact that they got what they wanted with the overturning of Roe, is not getting the extent of the victory they had hoped.""Only about one in 10 voters nationwide and across most states say abortion should be illegal in all cases, according to AP VoteCast. Even among white evangelical voters, while most say abortion should generally be illegal, only about two in 10 say abortion should be illegal in all cases. 
 Voters cast ballots in Grand Rapids, Mich., on Tuesday. Michigan was one of five states to enshrine abortion protection into law, contrary to the wishes of approximately two-thirds of evangelical voters.
 (Joel Bissell/The Grand Rapids Press via AP, File)Despite setbacks on the ballot measures, abortion opponents took heart from some other election results. Michael New, who teaches social research at The Catholic University of America, cited the comfortable re-election victories for GOP Govs. Greg Abbott in Texas, Brian Kemp in Georgia, Ron DeSantis in Florida and Mike DeWine in Ohio.""All these governors signed strong pro-life laws and did not hide from the abortion issue,"" New said.According to VoteCast, about 4 in 10 Catholics voting in the midterm elections identified as Democrats; about half as Republicans. A breakdown of some high-profile races for governor and for U.S. Senate illustrated how these voters are very much a swing constituency.In Wisconsin, Catholic voters slightly favored Republicans in those two races.In Pennsylvania, Catholics were slightly more likely to have voted for the Republican loser in the Senate race, Mehmet Oz, but more likely to vote for the Democratic winner in the governor’s race, Josh Shapiro. Oz is Muslim and Shapiro is Jewish.In Arizona, Catholic voters were evenly divided between the Democratic and Republican candidates for governor, while about 60% backed Democrat Mark Kelly, seeking re-election to the Senate. The tight races in Arizona remain uncalled by The Associated Press.In each of those three states, roughly two-thirds or more of white evangelical Christian voters backed the GOP candidates.Another notable factor in these results: large majorities of voters who describe themselves as nonreligious voted for the Democrats and supported abortion rights in their decisions on the Michigan and Kentucky ballot measures.While it remains uncertain which party will control Congress, John Fea and other scholars said the election was a setback for at least some Christian nationalist candidates on the Republican side – those who fuse Christian and American identity, symbols and mission.While some candidates associated with the view succeeded – such as U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Republican re-elected in her overwhelmingly red Georgia district – those facing a more mixed electorate struggled.Republican Doug Mastriano -- whose campaign rallies were infused with Christian music and symbols though he has rejected the ""Christian nationalist"" label -- lost decisively in the race for governor in Pennsylvania. Republican U.S. Rep. Lauren Boebert, also associated with the movement, faced a tighter-than-expected race for re-election in Colorado.Fea said Mastriano may have alienated people with his Christian nationalism but also with other factors, such as his efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election results.PENNSYLVANIA GOVERNOR: DEMOCRATIC ATTORNEY GENERAL JOSH SHAPIRO DEFEATS GOP CHALLENGER DOUG MASTRIANO""I think it’s a vote against an extreme brand of Christian nationalism, combined with election denying,"" said Fea, author of ""Believe Me: The Evangelical Road to Donald Trump.""Mastriano won about 6 in 10 of the votes of his fellow evangelical Christians, according to VoteCast, but that seemed to slightly lag behind the two-thirds who backed Mehmet Oz.Overall, among voters nationwide, about 4 in 10 say they attend religious services at least monthly; about a third say they never attend. About a fifth say they go once a week or more.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPDemocrats largely attend religious services less frequently – about 7 in 10 go less than monthly. Among Republicans, 46% attend at least monthly, while 54% go less often.

 Madeline Coggins | Fox News Facebook Twitter Flipboard Comments Print Email close Video ‘Modern Warriors’ tells the stories of America’s heroes Pete Hegseth hosts four highly-decorated veterans, sharing their stories and reflecting on why they served on Fox Nation’s ‘Modern Warriors.’Pete Hegseth hosted a special Veterans Day edition of Fox Nation's ""Modern Warriors,"" focusing on wokeness in the military. Former Apache helicopter pilot Wesley Hunt, retired U.S. Army Captain Jason Church, former Lieutenant Colonel Stu Scheller and former Green Beret Rep. Michael Waltz, R-Fla., shared their perspective on changes in the military culture on ""Modern Warriors: War on Warriors."" ""It's very real. It's actually coming from the soldiers, from the cadets in terms of the outcry about what's happening,"" Rep. Waltz said. ""A lot of recruits are saying, that's not what we signed up for, and it is tearing our military apart from the inside.""The Department of Defense and military schools have come under fire over efforts to push critical race theory and Diversity, Equity and Inclusion programs. Critics have argued this step is putting preparedness and strength on the back burner in favor of social justice efforts.CRITICAL RACE THEORY TAUGHT TO FUTURE MILITARY LEADERS AT U.S. MILITARY ACADEMIES, ACCORDING TO NEW STUDY""Inevitably, if you have people who cannot perform the job in positions of real importance, that's when people die,"" Captain Jason Church shared. ""So if we're prioritizing politics over military effectiveness and readiness, we will lose the next war."" 
 ""Modern Warriors"" is now streaming on Fox Nation, telling the stories of America's veterans.
 (Fox Nation)On the special episode of Fox Nation's ""Modern Warriors,"" the four veterans also shared with Hegseth that the emphasis within the military should be on meeting standards, not woke demands.""It's about, this is the standard to be a Marine, this is the standard to be the best Air Force pilot that you can be or to be a Green Beret, and that's it,"" Rep. Waltz said. ""You either meet the standard or you don't because that should be the military's sole objective, is, what is the standard that we need to have the best military members we can to defend the nation, to defeat our enemies.""""Everyone should subscribe to we want equality, we want one standard that we think, if you want to be an infantry officer, if you want to be an Apache pilot, if you want to be whatever it is, you have to achieve these standards,"" former Lieutenant Colonel Stu Scheller affirmed. VideoWhile the debate continues over woke ideology within the military, these veterans reflected on their time in service to the U.S. and what being a patriot is all about. CLICK HERE TO JOIN FOX NATION""It's a choice to go into combat arms that has nothing to do with your race, religion, color, or creed,"" former pilot Wesley Hunt said. Catch this special edition of ""Modern Warriors"" with Pete Hegseth, streaming now on Fox Nation, to hear more from America's heroes.Fox Nation programs are viewable on-demand and from your mobile device app, but only for Fox Nation subscribers.

 Facebook Twitter Instagram RSS Email Ukraine Published November 11, 2022 2:22pm EST Ukraine's Zelenskyy says Kherson 'ours' after Russian retreat Russia withdraws forces from Kherson in another tactical blow to Moscow 
 By
 Caitlin McFall | Fox News Facebook Twitter Flipboard Comments Print Email close Video US reaffirms 'unwavering' aid, support for Ukraine amid domestic political skirmishes Fox News senior foreign affairs correspondent Greg Palkot reports on bipartisan support for Ukraine despite political tensions over spending  abroad.Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenksyy championed another victory in Ukraine Friday after Russia announced all of its forces had withdrawn from the city of Kherson following months of brutal fighting in the region. ""Our people. Ours. Kherson,"" Zelenskyy wrote on Telegram. ""Today is a historic day. We are taking back Kherson.""The retreat from the southern city is another major setback for Moscow as its ""special military operation"" continues for nearly nine months and Ukrainian troops continue to make gradual gains in ousting Russian forces.  
 Ukrainians gather in central Kyiv to celebrate the recapturing of Kherson city, Ukraine, Friday, Nov. 11, 2022. 
 (AP Photo/Bernat Armangue)WITH RUSSIA'S RETREAT FROM KHERSON, RUSSIA AND UKRAINE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO NEGOTIATE PEACEZelenskyy said special units of Ukraine’s armed forces had made it inside Kherson as more troops were approaching to support the city. Videos emerged on social media showing Ukrainians in the city center chanting and celebrating, some with their pets while others held kids on their shoulders, though Fox News has not been able to independently verify these videos. The full retreat came after Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu gave the order to withdraw Wednesday as Ukrainian forces continued to advance in another counter-offensive operation. Russia’s Defense Ministry said that all remaining troops had been ordered out of the city of Kherson to the eastside of the Dnieper River and that ""not a single piece of military equipment or weapons"" had been left behind. Russia’s decision to remove its limited supplies is a change in operational strategy following its failure to hold its military lines or equipment in Kharkiv earlier this year. Recapturing Kherson is one of the biggest successes Kyiv has seen since it retook control over Kharkiv in September, but some defense officials are concerned it could be a Russian ploy.

What cannot be ruled out is that the Russians have set up a trap and plan to carry out a false flag operation,"" former DIA intelligence officer for Russian Doctrine & Strategy and the author of  ""Putin’s Playbook: Russia’s Secret Plan to Defeat America Rebekah Koffler told Fox News Digital. ""Things are very fluid now,"" she added, noting that the coming hours will be crucial in identifying the merits of the withdrawal. ""Ukrainian intelligence is very capable, having benefited from U.S. and NATO’s support. They almost certainly have planned for various contingencies.""Ukraine's Defense Intelligence confirmed that its forces had entered the city and urged Russian soldiers who remain in the area to surrender. ""Your commanders ordered you to dress in civilian clothes and try to flee Kherson independently. Obviously, you can't do this,"" the ministry said in a statement on Facebook.

 Facebook Twitter Instagram RSS Email Texas Published November 11, 2022 2:06pm EST Texas medical examiner killed by estranged husband in murder-suicide at office identified: reports Dallas man gunned down his estranged wife before turning weapon on himself 
 By
 Stephanie Pagones | Fox News Facebook Twitter Flipboard Comments Print Email close Video Texas preschool teacher arrested after toddlers eat THC gummies Four students at Primrose School of Prosper are recovering after being exposed to THC in their classroom. FOX 4 News Dallas-Fort Worth reports. If you or someone you know is having thoughts of suicide, please contact the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 988.Local officials have identified the Texas medical examiner killed by her estranged husband, a former college basketball star, who opened fire inside her second-floor office and then turned the gun on himself.James Frost, 51, bypassed the security at an employee entrance to the Dallas County Medical Examiner’s office in Dallas around 4:45 p.m. Tuesday, when he shot his estranged wife, Dr. Beth Frost, who worked in the building, local affiliate FOX 4 reported. James then reportedly suffered a fatal self-inflicted gunshot wound.Police rushed to what Dallas County Sheriff Marian Brown called ""an active shooter situation"" and evacuated the facility and an adjacent building, FOX 4 reported. James and Beth Frost were pronounced dead at the scene, Brown reportedly said. TEXAS POLICE SAY TWO DEAD IN SHOOTING AT DALLAS COUNTY MEDICAL EXAMINER'S OFFICE

 Facebook Twitter Instagram RSS Email Fox & Friends First Published November 11, 2022 2:01pm EST Texas school board candidates win big by opposing critical race theory Candidates join 'Fox & Friends First' as parents vote against CRT in schools 
 By
 Joshua Q. Nelson | Fox News Facebook Twitter Flipboard Comments Print Email close Video Texas rejected CRT because ‘it does not translate to the American dream’: LJ Francis LJ Francis, elected to Texas School Board, and Pat Hardy, re-elected to the Texas School Board, share how they hope to combat critical race theory from entering Texas schools.Voters rejected critical race theory this week in Texas by electing more Republican candidates to the state's board of education.Two of those winners, L.J. Francis and Pat Hardy, appeared on ""Fox & Friends First"" Friday to discuss their victories after they campaigned against CRT.""I think it's absolutely clear that that is the reason why we were successful on Tuesday night. When I started my campaign, I went and I spoke with parents and I listened to the community,"" Francis said.""And one thing they were talking about is that they reject critical race theory,"" he said, adding that the left's so-called ""diversity, equity, and inclusion"" agenda is not in line with the ""American dream."" VICTORIOUS FLORIDA SCHOOL BOARD CANDIDATES THANKFUL FOR DESANTIS' ENDORSEMENT: 'HELPED TREMENDOUSLY'Francis, a Jamaican immigrant, outlined what he believes should be conveyed to children.""I showed everyone that it doesn't matter where you're from. It matters what you want to achieve and if you work hard, you can achieve these things, without this reliance on race,"" he told Todd Piro. VideoEducation in Texas became a hot-button issue in the past few years amid the debates over critical race theory, gender issues and the controversy over certain library books.Hardy, a longtime social studies teacher, said that ""control needs to be on the local level."" She also argued that it is very important for local school boards to be aware of critical race theory and what’s being taught in public schools.""I've been a warrior against critical race theory in our schools. I hear it from parents constantly. I get phone calls with very sad comments about what's going on,"" she said, stressing that she wants children to be taught from a young age about patriotism, ""love of country"" and to appreciate the sacrifices of American service members. Ten Republican candidates won seats on the board Tuesday, compared to five Democrats. DESANTIS-BACKED SCHOOL BOARD CANDIDATES ALL WIN IN FLORIDA: ENDORSEMENT 'PUT US OVER THE EDGE'The victories underscore the phenomenon of parents across the country paying closer attention to their local school boards by challenging progressive curricula and contesting books they deem to be inappropriate. In Florida, candidates who ran on a similar platform and were backed by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis were also victorious.  VideoCindy Spray, who won her race in Manatee County, and Jackie Rosario, who won her race in Indian River County, joined ""Fox & Friends"" Thursday to discuss the impact of the DeSantis endorsement and how it resonated with their constituents. ""The support I got from Governor DeSantis is what put us over the edge,"" Spray told co-host Ainsley Earhardt. ""His view of how we need to stay back to the basics of education aligned with what I had viewed. And of course, my grandchildren. You have kids in school, you want to make sure that we're getting the education system that we're actually expecting from the public schools back to the basics and… supporting parental rights."" Joshua Q. Nelson is a reporter for Fox News Digital.Joshua focuses on politics, education policy ranging from the local to the federal level, and the parental uprising in education.Joining Fox News Digital in 2019, he previously graduated from Syracuse University with a degree in Political Science and is an alum of the National Journalism Center and the Heritage Foundation's Young Leaders Program. Story tips can be sent to joshua.nelson@fox.com and Joshua can be followed on Twitter and LinkedIn.

 By
 Joe Morgan | Fox News Facebook Twitter Flipboard Comments Print Email close Video Fox News Flash top sports headlines for November 11 Fox News Flash top sports headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.Brooklyn Nets All-Star Kyrie Irving is eligible to return to the basketball court on Sunday against the Los Angeles Lakers after being suspended for ""no less than five games"" after sharing an antisemitic film on social media. The Nets’ organization stated that Irving must meet a ""series of objective remedial measures"" in order to return to the team.

 (Jesse D. Garrabrant/NBAE via Getty Images)While it is unclear whether Irving has satisfied those ""remedial measures,"" Brooklyn owner Joe Tsai met with Irving on Thursday and said that he does not believe Irving holds any antisemitic beliefs. CELTICS’ JAYLEN BROWN QUESTIONS NIKE’S ‘ETHICS’ AFTER PHIL KNIGHT COMMENTS ON KYRIE IRVING""Clara and I met with Kyrie and his family yesterday,"" Tsai said in a tweet on Friday. ""We spent quality time to understand each other and it’s clear to me that Kyrie does not have any beliefs of hate towards Jewish people or any group.""""The Nets and Kyrie, together with the NBA and NBPA, are working constructively toward a process of forgiveness, healing and education.""Tsai made his fortune in China after founding the company Alibaba and has been criticized for defending some of China's controversial policies which infringe on human rights. Tsai’s statement regarding Irving comes on the heels of NBA commissioner Adam Silver’s meeting with Irving earlier in the week, in which Silver concluded that Irving ""no doubt"" is not antisemitic.

 Facebook Twitter Instagram RSS Email Democrats Published November 11, 2022 1:26pm EST Troubled crypto boss Sam Bankman-Fried, who lost $15B in a week, funneled millions to Dems, far-left causes Bankman-Fried, now estimated to have no material wealth, recently emerged as one of Democrats' largest financial backers 
 By
 Thomas Catenacci , Joe Schoffstall | Fox News Facebook Twitter Flipboard Comments Print Email close Video Varney: Crypto lost $2 trillion worth of value FOX Business host Stuart Varney on tech stocks and cryptocurrency value tanking. Sam Bankman-Fried, the now-bankrupt founder of crypto exchange FTX, is a prolific donor of Democratic candidates and liberal causes, and infused at least $38 million into left-wing groups during the 2022 election cycle.Bankman-Fried was the second-largest contributor to Democratic-affiliated political action committees (PACs) and organizations, behind only liberal financial magnate George Soros, who donated nearly $127 million during the midterm cycle, according to Federal Election Commission (FEC) data. However, the collapse of FTX this week has called into question Bankman-Fried's finances.A full-fledged liquidity crisis forced FTX to file for bankruptcy on Friday, and Bankman-Fried's wealth, which was estimated to be $15.6 billion earlier this week, has sharply plummeted, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The index currently estimates Bankman-Fried has no material wealth.""I'm sorry. That's the biggest thing,"" Bankman-Fried tweeted Thursday morning. ""I f---ed up, and should have done better.""FTX FOUNDER SAM BANKMAN-FRIED'S CRYPTO COLLAPSE APOLOGYBankman-Fried's philanthropic collective, the FTX Foundation, which was committed to fighting climate change and other global health issues, disintegrated as a result of the crisis. The group has supported the CarbonPlan and Giving Green, two climate initiatives dedicated to achieving a so-called green transition from fossil fuels, and the Good Food Institute, an organization pushing the expansion of plant-based meat.Leaders of the collective resigned Friday and said the group would no longer be able to perform its work or process grants.HERE ARE THE BIG MONEY DONORS BANKROLLING EACH SIDE ONE WEEK OUT FROM THE ELECTION""We are devastated to say that it looks likely that there are many committed grants that the Future Fund will be unable to honor,"" they wrote on a blog post. ""We are so sorry that it has come to this.""We joined the Future Fund to support incredible people and projects, and this outcome is heartbreaking to us."" 
 Sam Bankman-Fried contributed at least $38.2 million into left-wing causes ahead of the midterm election.
 (Ting Shen/Bloomberg via Getty Images)During the midterm election cycle, Bankman-Fried funneled most of his contributions to Protect Our Future PAC and House Majority PAC, both of which exclusively supported Democratic candidates.Protect Our Future was the primary recipient of his midterm largesse and received $27 million from the crypto magnate, making him by far the PAC's largest donor.Protect Our Future, in turn, spent more than $24 million backing various Democratic candidates with ad buys and direct mail services. The PAC also transferred millions to other groups, including nearly $900,000 to the Justice Unites Us PAC on April 1, FEC records show.Days after that donation, Justice Unites Us dropped roughly the same amount into canvassing for Carrick Flynn in Oregon's 6th Congressional District. Flynn, however, suffered an 18-point Democratic primary loss to Andrea Salinas.Bankman-Fried also pushed $6 million to the Nancy Pelosi-aligned House Majority PAC, which works to elect and maintain Democrats in Congress's lower chamber, and a half million dollars to the Chuck Schumer-tied Senate Majority PAC.BEYOND GEORGE SOROS, REPUBLICAN MEGA-DONORS REPRESENT 7 OF TOP 10 INDIVIDUALS POURING INTO $17B MIDTERMS 
 In October, Sam Bankman-Fried backed off a pledge to give $1 billion in political contributions through 2024, saying he would instead give closer to $100 million.
 (Jeenah Moon/Bloomberg via Getty Images)Additionally, the crypto magnate sent $2 million to the GMI PAC, which raised over $11 million as of mid-October.GMI transferred $5.25 million to its affiliated committee Web3 Forward, which spent more than $4 million on media buys for several Democratic candidates. Sen.-elect John Fetterman in Pennsylvania, Rep. Jasmine Crockett in Texas, and House candidates Jonathan Jackson in Illinois and Adam Hollier in Michigan were among those who benefited from the cash, Web3 Forward's filings show.Bankman-Fried sent six figures to several other groups, including the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.In October, Bankman-Fried backed off a pledge to give $1 billion in political contributions through 2024, saying he would instead give closer to $100 million, he told Politico. Bankman-Fried's recent financial troubles may ultimately foil his planned $100 million in political giving to Democratic endeavors.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP""This is an absolutely stunning turnaround from somebody who was the darling of Washington policy circles,"" Blockchain Association Executive Director Kristin Smith told Politico. ""It was built on a house of cards."" Thomas Catenacci is a politics writer for Fox News Digital.

In the 10 months I’ve been CBP’s Commissioner, I’ve gotten up to speed on the agency’s many complex areas of responsibility,"" he said. ""While CBP is an operational — not a policy-making — agency, I’ve been closely involved in the major DHS immigration, border security, trade, and other policy discussions throughout my time as Commissioner. I frequently share insights from CBP’s frontline law enforcement and civilian personnel in those discussions and will continue to do so.""

The Ohio Republican had abruptly announced he was departing Congress after a meeting with Pope Francis at the Capitol a few days before.As majority leader, McCarthy was in line to succeed Boehner. The full house would have to elect McCarthy, but first, the House Republican Conference needed to settle on its candidate. It was thought to be a fait accompli for McCarthy.McCarthy whispered something into Boehner’s ear. Boehner was surprised, and then strode to the microphone with an announcement for the room. However, no one could hear over the din.THE HITCHHIKER’S GUIDE TO MCCARTHY’S BUMPY ROAD TO THE SPEAKER’S SUITE

 (REUTERS/Carlos Barria)Republican members spilled out into the marble corridors of the Longworth House Office Building — the most acoustically-challenged location in all of Washington. A wall of reporters occupied three hallways. A bank of television cameras stood tripod to tripod near the foyer of the building between massive columns. Metal detectors and magnetometers from the U.S. Capitol Police beeped at regular intervals, as tourists and lobbyists tried to squeeze into the building. Capitol maintenance workers wheeled by stocks of cardboard boxes on hand trucks. Gigantic carts rumbled through the hall, loaded with office furniture, making a ridiculous ruckus.Nobody could hear a thing, least of all the Republicans in the room or the reporters in the hallway. However, a rumor swirled. It had to do with what Boehner said over the noise in the committee room. Apparently McCarthy told Boehner he was dropping out.Republicans did not know what was going on, but the conference meeting ended without a vote for speaker.Gossip reigned in the hall. Future House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wisc., dashed out of the room with the speed of Usain Bolt. Ryan’s office then published a statement just as quick to declare that he would not stand as a candidate for speaker.CONGRESSIONAL REPUBLICANS RECKON WITH DISAPPOINTING ELECTION RESULTS: ‘KNIVES ARE OUT,’ SOURCE SAYS

 (REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst)A phalanx of reporters pursued House Minority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., down a spiral staircase, asking if he would seek the Speakership. Scalise fixed his gaze on each step so he would not fall — and also did not acknowledge the press corps as reporters barked questions whether he would run for speaker.Some Republicans in the rooms were bewildered. There were other candidates for speaker. In fact, there may even be other GOPers who would like to have run now that McCarthy was done. Why didn’t the GOP just forge ahead with the election?However, that is not what went down.A few days later, Ryan backtracked. After some coaxing, Ryan announced that he would in fact run for speaker. Ryan then rode to victory over Rep. Daniel Webster, R-Fla.Many thought McCarthy was a political dead man walking after stepping aside in 2015 to make room for Ryan.Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, even challenged McCarthy for minority leader in late 2018.REPUBLICANS POINTING FINGERS AFTER WEAK MIDTERM RESULTS, DIRECTION OF PARTY IN QUESTION: ‘SOMETHING WAS OFF’However, McCarthy’s fortunes evolved. He brought his rival Jordan into the fold. There was chatter behind the scenes that Scalise may be angling to take on McCarthy. McCarthy then had it out on the phone with former President Trump as a mob ransacked the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. McCarthy even said Trump bore responsibility for the siege.However, politics is about reading the room. McCarthy quickly recognized that many House Republicans heard from constituents who supported the rioters and still embraced the former president.McCarthy hustled off to Mar-a-Lago, posed with former President Trump and immediately set about recruiting female and minority Republicans for the 2022 midterms.McCarthy also knew he had to shore up a schism with the conservative House Freedom Caucus. Aligning himself with Jordan — who used to lead the group — was key. However, there was even a more controversial brand of Freedom Caucus member on the scene now. There were the likes of Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga.House Democrats actually helped McCarthy by giving him a foil. 
 Former President Trump and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., meet at Mar-a-lago in January 2021. 
 (Save America PAC)The House voted to strip Greene and Rep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., from their committee assignments. McCarthy then converted their banishments into a cause celebre, promising he would reseat Greene and Gosar on committees if Republicans won the House. Moreover, there were suggestions that Republicans might return the favor and dismiss Democrats, like Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., from their committees should Republicans prevail. GOP loyalists roared in approval.McCarthy also took steps to legitimize Greene. He took Greene on a trip to the border. Greene was seated prominently behind McCarthy at a September event when House Republicans rolled out their agenda for 2023.You reap what you sow.McCarthy will soon face pressure from conservatives like Greene, Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., and the GOP base to take aggressive action against President Biden and members of his administration.Republicans may be headed for a slim majority in the House once all the votes from Tuesday's midterm elections are tallied. The entire House will select the speaker, and the successful candidate must have an outright majority of the entire House. In other words, 218 votes out of 435.The House must vote repeatedly until it elects a speaker. A vote for speaker has not gone to a second ballot since 1923.Before Tuesday, McCarthy probably had a range of seven to 10 Republicans who would not support him for speaker no matter what. That number could grow.McCarthy may be able to command the votes so long as he can keep Jordan in the fold.That is to say nothing of former President Trump.It would not take much for Trump to throw McCarthy under the bus, especially considering the GOP’s tepid success on Tuesday.However, there is a reason McCarthy did not become Speaker in 2015 when former Speaker Boehner resigned. McCarthy announced on Fox News that Republicans empaneled the Benghazi committee just to undercut the presidential bid of Hillary Clinton. It was as though McCarthy said the quiet part out loud.Support for McCarthy to succeed Boehner was already shaky, and some Republicans were already looking for a reason to oppose McCarthy. They found it in the Benghazi remark — and McCarthy was toast in that contest.Perhaps history could repeat itself.

 (AP Photo/Alex Brandon)After being promised a ""red wave,"" some Republicans may be looking for a reason to dump McCarthy. Tuesday’s weak tea at the ballot box could justify some GOP opposition to McCarthy for speaker. Moreover, if McCarthy does become speaker, he must veer to the right to accede to the demands of the Freedom Caucus on a host of issue — ranging from impeachments to funding the government to raising the debt ceiling — in order to make full use of the slim majority.In addition, the calling card of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., is passing major bills with the most narrow of margins. She has done it for two decades. Heretofore, McCarthy has lacked such an accurate vote counting prowess.McCarthy could face instant management problems.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPIn fact, McCarthy’s first challenge could come in mid-December. That is when a bill to avert a government shutdown comes due. If McCarthy does not stand against that bill and do what the Freedom Caucus wants, those same members could hold that against him when the House votes for Speaker in January.As we say, it will be ""about the math"" when it comes to McCarthy.And, so far, the algebraic equation for McCarthy’s ascent to the speaker’s suite is hard to solve.

Ron DeSantis, R-Fla., beat the ""stuffing out of.""Frost, who has been praised for being the first member of Gen Z elected to the U.S. Congress, represented a rare Democratic Party win on Tuesday in Florida, in the midst of massive Republican victories in the governor’s race and in the race for U.S. Senate.POTENTIAL RED WAVE TURNS INTO TRICKLE IN DISAPPOINTING MIDTERM ELECTIONS FOR REPUBLICANS 
 Democrat Congressman-elect from Florida Maxwell Frost discusses the midterms on ""The View.""
 (Screenshot/ABC)Democratic defeats in Florida were so profound they prompted Navarro to ask the guest about what he saw went wrong in the state, while providing her own theories.The host brought up the subject while ripping into Crist, stating, ""So you were the bright spot for Democrats in what was a night of a debacle in Florida, I think in large part because they nominated a pillow to run for governor, and Ron DeSantis beat the stuffing out of that pillow.""Navarro has been a critic of Crist for some time. In September, she interviewed the candidate and told him to his face she believed he’s a ""political mercenary"" who changes political parties for ""convenience.""During their conversation, Navarro grilled Crist over the fact that he was once a Republican running for office on a platform that championed traditional marriage and pro-life policies. On Friday, Navarro asked Frost, ""Tell me, how do you see what happened in Florida? Do you see it as a red wave? Peel back some of the layers of the onion for us.""ANA NAVARRO CLAIMS DESANTIS ‘GAMED THE SYSTEM’ AND WON AGAINST A ‘POLITICAL CORPSE’ 
 CNN Political Commentator Ana Navarro said Tuesday that Charlie Crist was a ""recycled has-been.""
 (Screenshot/CNN)Frost denied that it was a red wave and argued that Democrats lost because they didn’t show up to vote. He said, ""For me, a red wave is when it’s just more Republican voters than ever and that’s not what happened. What happened is Democrats didn’t turn out.""He continued, saying, ""And so for me, there’s a lot of soul-searching we need to do as a party in the state to figure out how are we gonna organize year-round, something my campaign is gonna be doing in January.""Frost added, ""We’re not gonna stop knocking doors, we’re not gonna stop making phone calls. Cause at the end of the day, when it’s election time, if you have built the trust with your constituent, you don’t have to persuade them to vote for you. You just have to remind them to go vote."" 
 Conservatives rushed to Twitter on Tuesday to spike the football when GOP Gov. Ron DeSantis was projected to defeat Charlie Crist to secure another term as Florida’s chief executive. 
 (James Gilbert/Getty Images)CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPFrost claimed that Democrats waited too long to persuade their voters in Florida. He stated, ""Democrats were seeing the early vote numbers in Florida, and I saw all the candidates come out and start persuading Democrats to go vote and telling them ‘It’s important, we gotta protect democracy, we need to protect abortion.’""The Congressman-elect concluded, ""But really in the future, we need to be in a place where voters are already coming out, and what we’re doing is just getting out the vote and letting people know where the polling locations are.""

 Nikolas Lanum | Fox News Facebook Twitter Flipboard Comments Print Email close Video Stacey Abrams' political career is 'done' after Gov. Brian Kemp wins re-election: Janelle King Speak Georgia Inc. co-founder Janelle King joined 'Fox & Friends First' to discuss Kemp's victory over Abrams and the Senate race between Raphael Warnock and Herschel Walker. The New York Times penned a retrospective on Stacey Abrams' gubernatorial campaign in Georgia, painting her road to defeat as one curtailed by lofty national ambitions and a neglect of Black and brown communities in the state. Reporters Maya King and Reid J. Epstein wrote that while Abrams’ first campaign gave her the appearance of a ""fierce political tactician,"" her second attempt at office ""exposed the limits"" of her skills as a political candidate. Abrams was easily defeated by Republican Gov. Brian Kemp in a highly anticipated rematch from 2018, and she didn't seriously threaten him in polls throughout the campaign.The Times interviewed a variety of figures close to Abrams, including lawmakers, community leaders and campaign aides, who painted her as a candidate distracted by national ambitions. She also was characterized as a politician better at talking policy than engaging in ""rope-line hugs"" and empathetic small talk. BETO O'ROURKE, STACEY ABRAMS RAZZED AFTER REPEATED LOSSES: ‘THEY'RE AMAZING AT SETTING DEMOCRAT MONEY ON FIRE’

 (Dustin Chambers/Bloomberg via Getty Images)Despite claims from Abrams supporters who blamed sexism, racism and voter suppression for her string of defeats, the Times noted that Abrams' fate may have been etched before her campaign even took off. Abrams’ actions appeared to suggest that her sights were set on things outside of Georgia, rather than the people of the state deciding whether to elect her. In May, Abrams called Georgia the ""worst state in the country to live in."" She also declared on ""The View"" that she wanted to one day be president of the United States.""She shot herself in the foot multiple times,"" Martha Zoller, a conservative radio host and former Brian Kemp aide, said. ""And the question was asked in many circles: If you really believe this about Georgia, why would you want to be governor?""The Times also spoke with David Brand, an Atlanta-based Democratic strategist, who was one of several Democrats that complained that Abrams was ""neglecting"" those who brought her into the political spotlight. ""She’s having Zoom meetings with Black businesspeople,"" Brand said. ""Brian Kemp’s having cocktails with them.""GEORGIA GOV. BRIAN KEMP WINS RE-ELECTION, DEFEATS DEMOCRAT STACEY ABRAMS

Derrick Jackson, an Atlanta-area state representative and member of Alpha Phi Alpha, said that he and several other groups invited Abrams to their gatherings in the spring, but she did not attend. Abrams eventually held a town hall event with the organizations months later, after polling showed her losing support with Black voters. Jackson said that Abrams needs to own some of her failures. DESPITE LOSS, MSNBC PANEL HAILS STACEY ABRAMS AS 'MOSES,' SAYS SHE 'PUT GEORGIA ON THE MAP FOR DEMOCRATS'

 (Fox News Digital/Hannah Ray Lambert)""If you’re running a statewide race, if you venture off, and you nationalize it, then that’s problematic,"" he said. People who worked closely with Abrams revealed that she was often removed from her constituents, according to the Times. ""Her campaign events were long on relatable anecdotes and policy explanations and short on up-close, personal moments. In her concession speech on Tuesday, she even acknowledged her introverted style,"" the paper noted. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPAn official for the New Georgia Project, Paul Glaze, knocked Abrams for always appearing ""100% poised and perfect all the time.""""It’s kind of hard to reach people that are turned off by the process if you don’t give off the perception or don’t appear willing to piss off the powers that be,"" he said.

 Facebook Twitter Instagram RSS Email Donald Trump Published November 11, 2022 2:59pm EST Calls for Trump to delay 2024 announcement until after Georgia runoff election grow louder Trump says he’ll make a ‘special announcement’ on Tuesday at his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida 
 By
 Paul Steinhauser | Fox News Facebook Twitter Flipboard Comments Print Email close Video Trump seems 'hellbent' on making presidential announcement soon: Mara Liasson Mara Liasson, Guy Benson and Marc Thiessen weigh in on presidential prospects following the 2022 midterm elections on 'Special Report.'With the GOP’s push to win back the Senate majority potentially coming down to the Senate runoff election in Georgia, a growing number of allies of Donald Trump are publicly and privately urging the former president not to make his expected 2024 announcement next Tuesday.Among the latest to call for Trump to postpone his announcement until after the Dec. 6 runoff election between Republican nominee Herschel Walker and Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock is veteran Republican consultant and Trump 2016 campaign senior adviser Mike Biundo.""I believe Donald Trump should wait to make an announcement about 2024 until after the Georgia runoff. Right now, Walker’s campaign needs to be the priority and focus for our party,"" Biundo emphasized in a tweet and a conversation with Fox News.But a source with knowledge of Trump’s thinking says ""regardless of the advice,"" he believes the former president will go ahead and make 2024 running news next week.BATTLE LINES DRAWN IN GEORGIA'S CRUCIAL SENATE RUNOFF ELECTION 
 Former President Donald Trump speaks during an election night event at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida, on Tuesday.
 (Joe Raedle/Getty Images)Warnock finished roughly 35,000 votes ahead of Walker out of nearly 4 million votes cast in Tuesday’s election. The Georgia Secretary of State's office announced Wednesday that the Senate election was headed to a runoff since no candidate received over 50% of the vote. According to the latest unofficial and incomplete returns, Warnock was at 49.4%, Walker at 48.5% and Libertarian Party nominee Chase Oliver at 2.1%. Under Georgia law, if no candidate tops 50% of the vote in the general election, the two top vote-getters compete in a runoff, which in this case will be held Dec. 6.FIRST ON FOX: WALKER HAULS IN $7.6 MILLION IN FIRST TWO DAYS OF RUNOFF CAMPAIGNWith votes in the midterm elections still being counted in the battleground states of Arizona and Nevada, and those Senate races still too close to call, the Republicans hold a 49-48 edge over the Democrats for control of the 100-member chamber. If either the Republicans or Democrats sweep both of those contests, control of the Senate will be settled. 
 Sen. Raphael Warnock, D-Ga., waves after giving a speech at his election night party at the Atlanta Marriott Marquis in Atlanta, Georgia, on Tuesday.
 (Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images)However, if the two parties split the contests in Arizona and Nevada, the Senate majority will be at stake in the Georgia runoff election. In Arizona, Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly currently holds a slight lead over GOP challenger Blake Masters, while in Nevada, Republican challenger and former State Attorney General Adam Laxalt maintains a razor-thin edge over Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto.Trump is already under fire by many in the Republican Party who argue that the former president’s backing of far right MAGA loyalists in GOP primaries hurt the party in this week’s general election, downsizing a potential red wave into a more of a trickle. But he appears to be moving ahead with what he’s touting as a ""special announcement"" on Tuesday night at his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida.TRUMP TELLS FOX NEWS ‘WHY WOULD ANYTHING CHANGE’ ON 2024 ANNOUNCEMENTThe former president, touting the wins of the more than 200 ""great"" Republican candidates he endorsed who were able to claim victory in their midterm election races, said in a Fox News Digital interview on Wednesday that his plans to make a ""major"" announcement on Tuesday have not changed.""We had tremendous success,"" Trump told Fox News Digital’s Brooke Singman, adding, ""Why would anything change?"" in reference to the upcoming announcement.Sources in Trump’s political orbit tell Fox News that top aides at Mar-a-Lago are urging Trump to move forward with that announcement. But they add that the former president continues to call friends and advisers, asking for their advice.Some of those people are giving their advice publicly.Jason Miller, a top official on the 2016 and 2020 Trump campaigns, says he’s encouraging Trump to delay the announcement until after the Senate runoff election is over.So is Fox News contributor and former Trump White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany. Video""I know there’s a temptation to starting talking about 2024 — no, no, no, no, no,"" McEnany said on Wednesday’s edition of Fox News’ ""Outnumbered."" ""2022 is not over. Every Republican energy needs to go to grinding the Biden agenda to a halt, and that could go straight through the state of Georgia,"" she said.McEnany, a co-host of the program, added that when it comes to a likely Trump 2024 announcement on Tuesday, ""I think he needs to put it on pause, absolutely.""Biundo urged the former president ""to heed his own words and put America first… I really think he would do everyone a favor, including himself, if he would take a step back, take a deep breath, cool the rhetoric, and let’s all work together to make sure Herschel Walker is the next senator from Georgia.""AFTER SLAMMING DESANTIS, TRUMP KNOCKS YOUNGKINPointing to Trump’s widely criticized verbal attacks this week at potential 2024 GOP nomination rivals — Republican Govs. Ron DeSantis of Florida and Glenn Youngkin of Virginia — Biundo said ""he seems like he's hot right now and upset about things.""He noted that ""there are a lot of people — some of them quietly, some of them more publicly — who’ve come out and said this. People that worked for him and actually do want to see him do well. And he would do well to listen to them.""Georgia Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan, a vocal Republican critic of the former president, called Trump a ""conservative distraction"" when it comes to the Senate runoff election in his state. 
 Republican U.S. Senate nominee Herschel Walker speaks to supporters as his wife Julie Blanchard looks on during an election night event in Atlanta, Georgia, on Tuesday.
 (Alex Wong/Getty Images)Duncan, who opted against running for re-election this year to focus on his effort to reboot what he hopes will be a post-Trump GOP, told Fox News he would encourage Walker ""to call Donald Trump personally and tell him to stay home, to stay out of Georgia. Enough’s enough.""Corey Lewandowski, a longtime top Trump adviser who managed Trump’s historic 2016 presidential primary campaign, also urged Trump to wait on any 2024 declaration — but for a different reason. ""Getting in early for a guy with 100% name ID — you don’t need to,"" Lewandowski emphasized.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""Once you become an official candidate, there are limitations on what you can and cannot do. Being a non-candidate is actually advantageous for a guy with 100% name ID and $100 million in the bank,"" he said.But a source close to the former president tells Fox News that Trump is ""going to announce on Tuesday"" regardless of advice from some people in the former president’s orbit. ""I am very certain that is what he’s going to do."" Paul Steinhauser is a politics reporter based in New Hampshire.

DeSantis' re-election.Twitter users reacted to the news that a federal judge in Texas blocked President Biden’s student loan handout.On Thursday, U.S. District Judge Mark Pittman ruled that Biden’s executive action was unconstitutional because Congress didn’t approve the sweeping plan. In fact, the judge claimed it was one of the largest executive branch overreaches in the ""history of the United States.""As Fox Business reported, Pittman’s opinion on the ruling stated, ""No one can plausibly deny that it is either one of the largest delegations of legislative power to the executive branch, or one of the largest exercises of legislative power without congressional authority in the history of the United States.""GUTFELD: BIDEN'S STUDENT LOAN HANDOUT IS ON HOLD AGAIN | FOX NEWS VIDEO 
 A federal judge ruled that Biden's student loan handout was unconstitutional. 
 The handout, announced by Biden in August, was intended to provide upwards of $20,000 of student debt relief to borrowers making under $125,000 a year. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the plan would have cost American taxpayers over $400 billion.Liberals on the platform expressed outrage over the ruling, while conservatives ridiculed Biden’s entire handout strategy as being a cynical ploy to garner Democratic votes for the midterms.  The Federalist co-founder Sean Davis wrote, ""Doesn’t matter to Biden. Its only purpose was to buy votes for last Tuesday.""American Greatness senior Fellow Ned Ryun tweeted, ""Fascinating. Motivated under 30s to come out and vote and in the end, Biden got what he wanted and they got played for fools.""Liberal radio host Kyle Kulinski expressed frustrated over the ruling, stating, ""92% of student loan debt is owned by the federal government but apparently the federal government doesn’t have the right to reduce it? Oh please. Conservative judges are judicial activists who make sh-- up to f--- over poor people. Thankfully this will be appealed.""Conservative actor Rob Schneider seemed relieved over the ruling, commenting, ""A federal judge tonight vacated the Presidents executive order to forgive student loans on a mass basis as unlawful.

Despite this lawless ruling from a Trump-appointed judge, @POTUS’ legal authority to cancel student debt is clear.""The Blaze’s Matt Kibbe gave kudos to what he claimed was a Biden scheme. He tweeted, ""Give Biden credit: Student loan forgiveness was cynical and dishonest, but also the best bait and switch scheme in modern political history.""CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPRep.

Michael McCaul, R-Texas, who is set to take the top spot on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, told Fox News Digital that getting to the bottom of the deadly Afghanistan exit is a top priority, particularly to support veterans.""Afghanistan will be a major area of focus, and it's important because of our veterans.

 Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, is set to take the top spot on the House Foreign Affairs Committee.
 (Fox News)""The Taliban was put in charge of the perimeter, the suicide bomber came in and killed 13 servicemen and women. And then American citizens left behind and a hundred thousand Afghan partners that we promised we would protect them [are] at the mercy of the Taliban. Now China is in there,"" McCaul said. ""But most importantly is that Afghanistan was a turning point of projecting weakness over strength.""The Afghanistan exit and the waiving of Nord Stream 2 sanctions emboldened Russian President Vladimir Putin to stage the largest invasion in Europe since World War II, he told Fox News Digital.The congressman said Chinese President Xi Jinping is observing the United States' projection of weakness as he considers a move to invade Taiwan, as is North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un, who has fired rockets near Japan recently.""All of our adversaries are emboldened and empowered now...

And I tell them it was because we didn't have another 9/11,"" he said.""But it's hard when they look at China is in [Afghanistan] with $1 trillion of lithium and will most likely get access to Bagram Air Base and which were our eyes and ears in Russia, China and Iran.""McCaul, who is chairman emertius on the Homeland Security Committee, said he is interested in looking into DHS and the department's ""disinformation"" campaign.

James Comer, R-Ky., who will lead the House Oversight and Reform Committee to look into the Biden laptop because it involves China.""Hunter Biden has had all these dealings with China financially and, you know, maybe at the beginning people thought it was a conspiracy theory, but there seems to be some fire to the smoke, if you will, particularly in terms of his father's role with the business dealings and whether his father had a pecuniary gain to that,"" he told Fox News Digital.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Federal investigators are weighing whether to charge Biden with various tax and foreign lobbying violations, false statements and more, with a former official telling Fox News in October that an outcome to the case could be ""imminent.""The president's son has been under federal investigation since 2018.

 By
 Tyler Olson , Kelly Phares | Fox News Facebook Twitter Flipboard Comments Print Email close Video Georgia Senate race goes 'back to square one': Doug Collins Former Georgia congressman Doug Collins says the Georgia senate runoff is less about endorsements, and more about getting voters back to the polls.Sen. Marco Rubio is calling for Senate Republicans to delay their leadership elections, as more members of the party's conference in the Senate appear to be bucking Minority Leader Mitch McConnell.""The Senate GOP leadership vote next week should be postponed,"" Rubio, R-Fla., tweeted Friday. ""First we need to make sure that those who want to lead us are genuinely committed to fighting for the priorities & values of the working Americans (of every background) who gave us big wins in states like #Florida."" 
 Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., called for a delay in the Senate GOP's leadership elections on Friday.
 (Eva Marie Uzcategui/Bloomberg via Getty Images)MISSOURI REPUBLICANS HAWLEY AND SCHMITT SAY SENATE NEEDS NEW LEADERSHIP: ‘NOT MITCH MCCONNELL’Rubio is just the latest Republican to take an apparent swipe at McConnell, R-Ky. Multiple GOP Senate candidates, including Sen.-elect Eric Schmitt, R-Mo., have said they would not support McConnell for party leader for the next Congress. Schmitt's fellow Missourian, GOP Sen. Josh Hawley, has also attacked McConnell in recent weeks. He supported Rubio's call for a delay in leadership elections in a tweet.

I don’t know why Senate GOP would hold a leadership vote for the next Congress before this election is finished,"" Hawley said. ""We have a runoff in #GASenate - are they saying that doesn’t matter? Don’t disenfranchise @HerschelWalker.""Sen. Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyo., also backed up Rubio, tweeting, ""Second,"" in response to his post. ""It makes no sense for Senate to have leadership elections before GA runoff. We don’t yet know whether we’ll have a majority & Herschel Walker deserves a say in our leadership,"" Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, added later Friday. :Critically, we need to hear a specific plan for the next 2 yrs from any candidate for leadership.""MIDTERM ELECTIONS: HAWLEY SLAMS ‘WASHINGTON REPUBLICANISM’ AFTER RED WAVE FIZZLESIt is not clear there are even close to enough votes to block McConnell from being the Republicans' party leader in the next Congress. He has enjoyed significant support from GOP senators in the past, and would become the longest-serving Senate party leader ever if re-elected as the top Republican in the chamber. Furthermore, elections for Senate leader — unlike House speaker — are done by a simple majority of the conference, rather than a majority of the chamber. That gives McConnell significant cushion, even if several senators vocally come out against him. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPMcConnell's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Fox News' Chris Pandolfo and Haris Alic contributed to this report.  Tyler Olson is a reporter covering the Senate for Fox News Digital.

 By
 Houston Keene | Fox News Facebook Twitter Flipboard Comments Print Email close Video Trump goes after 'Ron DeSanctimonious' again after Florida governor's re-election Fox News’ Kevin Corke reports on the battle for control of Congress, with key races in Arizona, Nevada and Georgia still too close to call, and discusses former President Donald Trump taking a dig at Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis.Former President Donald Trump is adding to the list of other Republicans he is singling out for ridicule in the leadup to his expected presidential campaign announcement Tuesday, dropping popular Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin into his crosshairs.Trump wrote in a TruthSocial post on Friday that the Old Dominion governor’s name sounds ""Chinese,"" while spelling it almost like South Korean-born California GOP Rep. Young Kim’s name. Kim was re-elected to the House in the midterm elections.""Young Kin (now that’s an interesting take. Sounds Chinese, doesn’t it?) in Virginia couldn’t have won without me,"" Trump wrote on TruthSocial. ""I Endorsed him, did a very big Trump Rally for him telephonically, got MAGA to Vote for him - or he couldn’t have come close to winning.""But he knows that, and admits it,"" Trump continued.

 Former President Donald Trump's TruthSocial post attacking Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin.
 (Fox News Digital)Trump has been teasing his return to the campaign trail for months, and, true to style, he’s already taking shots at potential political rivals. The focus on his opponents names recalls the 2016 presidential campaign, when terms like ""Little Marco"" for Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and ""Low Energy Jeb"" for former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush diminished his opponents to great effect.The former president ruffled Republican feathers earlier this week when he opened fire on Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis during a Pennsylvania rally just days before the midterm elections, branding him the new nickname ""Ron DeSanctimonious.""REPUBLICANS SPLIT ON TRUMP’S EFFECT ON LACKLUSTER MIDTERMS AS CONTROL OF CONGRESS HANGS IN BALANCE 
 Former President Donald Trump has been taking aim at potential 2024 political rivals months ahead of the GOP primary election.
 (AP Photo/Evan Vucci, File)""We’re winning big in the Republican Party for the nomination like nobody’s ever seen before,"" Trump said before listing other Republicans who may challenge him, as well as their approval ratings.""There it is, Trump at 71%, Ron DeSanctimonious at 10%,"" Trump said. ""Mike Pence at 7, oh, Mike is doing better than I thought. Liz Cheney, there’s no way she’s at 4%. There’s no way. There’s no way. But we’re at 71 to 10 to 7 to 4.""Trump sparked immediate backlash from many Republicans, who criticized the former president for taking the jab at DeSantis a few days before the midterm elections.The former president attacked DeSantis with the same nickname following the election, continuing his digs at his former political protégé.DeSantis handily prevailed in the 2022 midterms with Florida’s new red hue a bright spot in a disappointing election for Republicans, who were hoping to ride a red wave into control of Congress. 
 Former President Donald Trump attacked Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis as ""Ron DeSanctimonious"" ahead of Tuesday's midterm elections, sparking GOP criticism.

Winsome Sears said she ""could not support"" Trump in 2024.TRUMP MOCKS DESANTIS AT PENNSYLVANIA RALLY: ‘RON DESANCTIMONIOUS’Similar in response to the attacks on DeSantis, Trump faced heavy criticism for his attack on Youngkin from Republicans who defended the Virginia governor.Youngkin reacted to the attack on Friday while speaking with reporters, saying he ""didn't see it"" and that name-calling wasn't his style.""You all know me, I do not call people names, I really work hard to bring people together, and that's what we're working to do,"" Youngkin said.""Well, that's what I'm saying, and that's just not the way I roll and not the way I behave,"" the Virginia governor said when pressed by reporters saying he had been called a name by the former president.However, while taking a tough stance against Youngkin and DeSantis, Trump’s jabs at the rising GOP stars also give insight into whom the former president views as potential 2024 threats.Youngkin’s name has been floated as a potential 2024 pick for the Republicans, thanks in part to his successful campaign that made education a central issue and rallied people to vote across the aisle.The Old Dominion governor’s campaign also walked a line between MAGA and moderate crowds well by accepting Trump’s endorsement while keeping somewhat distant from the former president.DeSantis’ name has been floated as a potential GOP nominee to take back the White House in 2024 since President Biden took office, and has only grown in the days since his sweeping reelection win.  
 Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin was attacked by former President Donald Trump on Friday, with Trump writing that his name sounds ""Chinese"" while spelling it like South Korea-born California GOP Rep. Young Kim's name.
 (Sarah Silbiger/Getty Images)Trump has teased for months that he will be making another run for the White House and is expected to do so next week.However, the school of thought that most Republicans will move out of the way in the wake of Trump’s expected announcement may not be as viable anymore.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPTrump’s impact on the midterms, viewed by many GOP leaders as negative, may also spur prominent Republicans who are against running in light of the former president’s announcement to change their plans.

 By
 Joe Morgan | Fox News Facebook Twitter Flipboard Comments Print Email close Video Fox News Flash top sports headlines for November 11 Fox News Flash top sports headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.Alabama football is going through a season that will be classified as a disappointment after losing its second game of the season in Week 10 to LSU. It’s been a frustrating season for the Crimson Tide, who have often appeared undisciplined, resulting in the third most penalties of any team in the FBS.

 (Carlos M. Saavedra/Sports Illustrated via Getty Images))But one fan seems to think that head coach Nick Saban has taken it all in stride, asking him on Thursday what he’s done this season in order to remain ""calmer on the sidelines."" ""Usually, one of my first prayers in church on Sunday is to pray that I don’t get mad, because a lot of times when I get mad, I do things that I wish I wouldn’t have done,"" Saban responded on the ""Hey Coach"" radio show. ""I say things that I wish I wouldn’t have said, and I don’t make really good decisions and choices.

 (Jonathan Bachman/Getty Images)""So, this has been a lifelong sort of goal to not get too emotional, not get too upset. I think that sometimes it’s the kind of team you have. Some guys really need you to get on them. Some guys get a little upset maybe and don’t respond very well when you get on them. It bothers them a lot. Makes them think that they’re not pleasing you."" ""I found that players respond better to teaching and showing them what they did wrong than they do actually just yelling and screaming,"" Saban added. ""I don’t think that does a lot of good.""Saban has always been known for occasionally chewing out his players and assistant coaches.

 (Jonathan Bachman/Getty Images)In the first half of Alabama’s loss to Tennessee in Week 7, Saban went ballistic on Quandarrius Robinson after the player had inexplicably tried to pick up a bouncing ball on an Alabama punt with defenders all around him. Tennessee recovered the ball at the Crimson Tide's 40-yard line, and Saban let his player have it after the mental error.Alabama will look to keep its slim chances alive in the SEC West on Saturday as they head to Oxford to take on No. 11 Ole Miss.   Joe Morgan is a Sports Reporter for Fox News.

 Army veteran Jackson Schroeder tries out his hand prosthetic after receiving the Starfish Procedure, thanks to Drs. Glenn Gaston and Bryan Loeffler. He was the first veteran in the United States to benefit from the new procedure.
 (Jackson Schroeder )""Almost the next day post-surgery, I felt like I could use my hand in a different way,"" he said. ""It felt a lot different.""The new technology developed in Charlotte, North Carolina, allows the patient to move each individual finger. It's a function that was not available previously.Creating an ‘intuitive and natural’ prostheticOrthoCarolina’s Gaston and Loeffler, the masterminds of the procedure, also started the clinic’s Reconstructive Center for Lost Limbs.Gaston told Fox News Digital that the idea was sparked nearly a decade ago when the doctors were discussing the poor quality of prosthetics for partial hand amputees. 
 Dr. Glenn Gaston is the hand fellowship director at OrthoCarolina. He serves as hand consultant for the Carolina Panthers, the Charlotte Hornets, Hendrick Motor Sports (NASCAR) and Joe Gibbs Racing (NASCAR), among other organizations. 
 (OrthoCarolina)""They just don’t give good function,"" he said. ""You’ve got something that either looks like a hand but doesn’t function, or functions but all the fingers open and close at the same time.""Loeffler added that what it came down to was ""looking at a problem that didn’t have a good solution."" When part of the hand is amputated, the muscles that control the fingers still exist. This led Gaston and Loeffler to the dream of accomplishing an ""intuitive and natural"" prosthetic so that recipients could move every finger individually.Gaston explained that when part of the hand is amputated, the muscles that control the fingers still exist — so the doctors’ mission wasn’t out of reach with new and developing technology.NEW YORK JETS PAY TRIBUTE TO AMERICA'S MILITARY, VETERANS WITH ANNUAL SALUTE TO SERVICE GAME""We took the [myoelectric fingers] that were in existence, and we figured out how to make them work best,"" Loeffler said. That way, he added, ""a patient could learn how to use them without spending hours and hours trying to figure out how to make a finger go up and down."" 
 An up-close look at one of Jackson Schroeder's hand prosthetics.
 (Jackson Schroeder )The doctors named it the Starfish Procedure, since starfish have the ability to regrow lost limbs on their own. The dissected hand muscles also resemble the marine animal.The operation transfers the live muscles in the hand to underneath the skin on the back of the hand — which lines up with the sensors on the prosthetic to spark function.ARMY VETERAN REGAINS ABILITY TO WALK WITH ROBOTIC EXOSKELETON AFTER PARALYSIS: ‘BEYOND WORDS’After testing the procedure on their first patient in 2016 and seeing ""phenomenal"" results, the doctors built the first prosthetic with the help of Hanger Clinic, a medical device company.""And he [their first patient to receive this] became the first person in the world who had independent finger control of a prosthetic hand,"" Gaston said.25 successful Starfish surgeries Schroeder noted that the procedure is not ""incredibly invasive,"" which allowed him to have a swift recovery. He said he began using the prosthetic and applying it about a month later. 
 Jackson Schroeder shows off his hand prosthetic during an on-camera interview with Fox News Digital on Nov. 7, 2022. 
 (Angelica Stabile/Fox News Digital)""I don’t think it’ll be a struggle feeling out of place in the workplace, or feeling like I’m at a disadvantage,"" he said.""I wouldn’t call it an advantage, but my friends definitely think it’s pretty cool,"" he also said.ON PTSD AWARENESS DAY, IMPORTANT HELP FOR VETERANS, MILITARY SERVICE MEMBERS IN SEARCH OF BETTER SLEEPThe procedure has since been successfully administered to 25 patients in OrthoCarolina’s care — including Private Schroeder.""We have a great affinity for our military at OrthoCarolina,"" Gaston said. 
 Army veteran Jackson Schroeder tries out his hand prosthetic. ""When the opportunity to help Jackson came along, we couldn’t have been more excited,"" said Dr. Gaston, one of the surgeons who created the Starfish Procedure. 
 (Jackson Schroeder )""We absolutely have immense respect for our military and the service they provide, and we’re honored to give any small service back.""OrthoCarolina also offers a fellowship that trains four doctors per year — and one of those open slots is always held for military physicians.""So when the opportunity to help Jackson came along, we couldn’t have been more excited,"" Gaston said.Loeffler championed Schroeder as a ""polished young man"" who was able to face a devastating injury with a positive attitude. 
 Dr. Bryan Loeffler, named one of North Carolina's Top Doctors, is a specialist in the full spectrum of hand and upper extremity disorders, from the fingertips to the shoulder.
 (OrthoCarolina)""We were really privileged to have the opportunity to take care of Jackson,"" he said, noting his military service. ""It was a real honor to take his situation and try to make the most of it.""CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTERSchroeder shared in a sweet moment that he’s ""not really sure where he would be"" without the help of his two doctors.Gaston said that watching amputee ""veterans"" within the clinic shed some hope with others has been ""really special"" as the procedure catches on.""Raising awareness, raising hope, making people recognize that there now are centers of excellence like our clinic that exist that can help these patients"" — this is what is so rewarding, he noted. 
 Jackson Schroeder demonstrates his finger movement during an interview with Fox News Digital on Nov. 7, 2022.
 (Angelica Stabile/Fox News Digital)The clinic is now on its third generation of the prosthetic, said Loeffler. The technology can capture the purpose of the surgery ""even better"" than before.""So, what [Jackson] is able to do with it is absolutely unbelievable,"" he said.""I would honestly say he probably has the single best control of a partial hand prosthetic on the face of the Earth.""CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPSchroeder was discharged from active duty in May 2021. He is currently a sophomore at the University of Wyoming and is studying marketing.

 Facebook Twitter Instagram RSS Email Republicans Published November 11, 2022 12:00pm EST Republican House majority, even if miniscule, will deliver a top GOP priority: the power to investigate The Biden administration can expect withering scrutiny as Republicans seize committee gavels 
 By
 Haris Alic | Fox News Facebook Twitter Flipboard Comments Print Email close Video The Senate Judiciary Committee holds a hearing on FBI oversight The Senate Judiciary Committee holds a hearing on FBI oversight.House Republicans are pledging that extensive oversight investigations into President Biden and administration officials will take place next Congress regardless of the size of their majority. GOP lawmakers say that even a one-seat majority will empower them to take the reins of congressional committees, and with that will come subpoena power to compel Biden administration officials to furnish documents and testimony on various topics. ""Holding the administration accountable through vigorous oversight was a top priority laid out by [GOP] Leader Kevin McCarthy,"" said Rep. Lloyd Smucker, R-Pa. ""Obviously, we could do that just by holding the gavel, regardless of our margin, regardless if we have control of the Senate."" Smucker, who is vying to chair the House Budget Committee, said he was eager to use the panel's power to increase transparency into how the Biden administration was spending taxpayer money. REPUBLICANS PLAN IMMEDIATE IRS OVERSIGHT IF THEY TAKE CONTROL OF THE HOUSE 
(""Holding the administration accountable through vigorous oversight was a top priority laid out by [GOP] Leader Kevin McCarthy,"" said Rep. Lloyd Smucker, R-Pa.)In recent days, Republicans have been grappling with how their governing agenda is likely to change after a much-predicted GOP wave failed to materialize on Election Night. At the moment, the Republican majority looks to be anywhere between 218 seats, the bare minimum needed to control the House, and 230 seats. The latter would constitute a sweep of all outstanding races, including some in which Democrats are favored, but still falls far short of the 60 seats McCarthy once said were possible.HOUSE REPUBLICANS WILL TARGET OBAMA-ERA OFFICIALS IN HUNTER BIDEN PROBEWhile the media and political observers have speculated that a narrow majority might prove ungovernable, several House Republicans contend differently. Rep. James Comer, R-Ky., argued that the GOP had not promised anything on the campaign trail it could not deliver regardless of the size of its majority. Comer, who is set to chair the House Oversight Committee next Congress, said that Republicans understood that with President Biden in the White House for at least another two years, their agenda would always need to focus heavily on accountability.

 (Jonathan Ernst-Pool/Getty Images)""For the past two years, one-party Democrat rule has resulted in multiple crises that are harming Americans without any oversight and accountability,"" said Comer. ""With the power of the gavel, Republicans will return the Oversight Committee back to its primary duty to root out waste, fraud, abuse, and mismanagement in the federal government and hold the Biden Administration accountable."" Comer cited investigations his committee planned to launch into were the White House's withdrawal from Afghanistan, the origins of the COVID-19 virus, and Hunter Biden's business dealings. ""We will use all tools at our disposal to identify problems and propose solutions that make the federal government more efficient, effective, transparent, and accountable to the American people,"" said Comer.  
 ""Every congressional committee has oversight responsibility, and we will finally get the answers the American people deserve,"" said House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. 
 (AP Photo/Barry Reeger)McCarthy, who is campaigning for the post of House speaker, has long promised to make oversight a key priority for every congressional committee. The California Republican has even instructed incoming committee chairmen to focus on building out their oversight capacities before hiring other staffers. ""Every congressional committee has oversight responsibility, and we will finally get the answers the American people deserve,"" said McCarthy. Smucker told Fox News Digital that emphasis on oversight was one shared by nearly every single House Republican. ""There might be disagreements over tactics, but on substance, we are fairly united,"" said the Pennsylvania Republican. 
 ""Lots of luck in your senior year, as my coach used to say,"" President Biden joked with reporters when asked about possible GOP investigations of his son Hunter.

 Megan Myers | Fox News Facebook Twitter Flipboard Comments Print Email close Video Arizona border rancher: MS-13 came knocking at my door An Arizona rancher of three decades along the southern border urges Congress and President Biden to finish the border wall to save the lives of migrants.ARIVACA, Ariz. – A rancher along the southern border said he's seen a significant increase in drug smugglers — sometimes toting guns — crossing his land and has found bodies of migrants who died on his property trying to make it into the U.S.""We've been here 35 years now, and it's a wonderful ranch, except we are very ticked off that all these drug packers are coming to my ranch to poison our American people,"" Jim Chilton, owner of the Chilton Ranch, told Fox News.WATCH AN ARIZONA RANCHER EXPLAIN WHAT HE'S SEEN AT THE SOUTHERN BORDER: VideoWATCH MORE FOX NEWS DIGITAL ORIGINALS HEREPart of Chilton's property was protected by the border wall. He urged President Biden and Congress to finish construction in order to protect the country — and him and his wife. He said on one occasion, Chilton's wife, Sue, was home alone and answered a knock on the door to MS-13 members carrying guns.""It’s kind of scary,"" Chilton, who comes from a long line of ranchers, told Fox News. ""That’s just life on the border.""Chilton said thousands of migrants crossed his property in 2022, marking a significant increase from years prior. He suspects many are carrying drugs.On Monday, Arizona border officials in Nogales, around 30 miles from Chilton, seized around 776,000 fentanyl pills, 289 pounds of methamphetamine and 55 pounds of heroin, Customs and Border Protection Nogales Port Director Michael Humphries tweeted. Nearly 15,000 pounds of fentanyl has been seized along the southern border this year, according to CBP. AT LEAST 64,000 ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS EVADED BORDER PATROL IN OCTOBER, 205,000 APPREHENSIONSYet Chilton and his wife have still helped migrants on multiple occasions despite safety concerns as more knocked on their door for help. ""Nobody deserves to die in the desert,"" regardless of whether they are criminals, Chilton said. ""We try to help people by providing water, but all the bad guys come to our ranch.""Chilton said he installed drinking fountains to serve migrants. Still, he's found he's had ""a lot of people die on the ranch.""At least 853 migrants died crossing the southern border this year, surpassing the previous record of 547 in 2021, according to U.S. Border Patrol data obtained by CBS News. 
 The Biden administration halted construction of former President Donald Trump's border wall in January 2021, leaving a gap on Jim Chilton's ranch.

""The real truth is a wall can save lives.""Nearly 4 million migrants have crossed into the U.S. since Biden took office, according to CBP. Close to 1 million of those migrants have traveled through Arizona. Chilton blames the influx on the unfinished border wall that Biden halted in 2021. ""Congress needs to appropriate the money to secure the border,"" Chilton said.

 Facebook Twitter Instagram RSS Email OPINION Published November 11, 2022 12:00pm EST Vietnam veterans step up to honor Medal of Honor recipient Michael Crescenz, my brother and theirs This was the funeral they couldn't attend, the recognition so many Vietnam vets were denied 
 By
 Joe Crescenz | Fox News Facebook Twitter Flipboard Comments Print Email close Video Heroes Honor Festival celebrates Vietnam veterans Sgts. Ben Peterson, Brandon Boron and Renee Bennett join ‘Fox & Friends Weekend’ to discuss the Heroes Honor Festival. NEWYou can now listen to Fox News articles!
 My older brother Mike was 19 when he was killed in Vietnam on Nov. 20, 1968. He died while charging machine gun bunkers during a battle on a mountain called Nui Chom. He sacrificed himself to save the lives of his fellow soldiers and, as a result, was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor.When Mike was laid to rest in Holy Sepulchre Cemetery near our family’s home in Philadelphia, I thought that was the end of his story. It wasn’t.Almost 40 years later, when I decided to see about transferring his remains to Arlington National Cemetery, most of the local veteran community did not know about Mike at all, or very little. As I went through the processes necessary to get him moved, the word started to get around.

 When the day came for Mike’s disinterment ceremony – May 2, 2008 – we went to Holy Sepulchre thinking that only family members and a few friends from the old neighborhood would be there. But we found a large contingent of veterans waiting to pay their respects to Mike’s memory.VETERANS DAY: 5 LESSONS TO CONVEY TO CHILDREN ABOUT WARNear the gravesite the veterans had placed a soldier’s cross – an M16 thrust into the ground bayonet first, Army boots lined up at the base, a helmet sitting atop, and dog tags dangling from the weapon. They’d also established a flag line all along the road into the cemetery and forming a perimeter around the grave. There was even an Air Force honor guard from the nearby Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Willow Grove standing at attention. Some of the veterans rode in on motorcycles, and they, along with a Philadelphia Police Department motorcycle unit, escorted Mike’s body to the James J. Terry Funeral Home in Downingtown, where he would await the final transfer to Arlington.Throughout the day, you could see how much it meant to these veterans to do all this for one of their own.

 The veteran community came out in even bigger numbers when Mike’s body was taken to Arlington 10 days later. A large contingent joined us in Downingtown to make the trip south, and in Maryland another group joined the convoy. There were dozens of cars and trucks and motorcycles that made the journey in the pouring rain. Along the way, each time we crossed a state border, we were escorted by a different set of State Police troopers.​When we arrived at Arlington, after checking in at the office, we went to the gravesite and were astounded to see hundreds more people waiting for us, including two Medal of Honor recipients of the Vietnam War.LAST WWII MEDAL OF HONOR RECIPIENT'S FOUNDATION CARRIES ON LEGACY HELPING GOLD STAR FAMILIES: ‘HERE TO SERVE’We did not know most of these people, but began to understand that this was not just a funeral for a stranger, but rather an honor bestowed on a ""brother in arms."" It was the funeral they couldn’t attend when they were overseas. It was the honor and recognition that they did not receive when they returned home.

 As I started to get to know many of these veterans in the weeks and months after Mike’s reburial, they started to come to me with other ideas about honoring him. My parents never made a big deal about what Mike did because other families – in our neighborhood and throughout the city – had losses too, some without recognition of any kind. The veterans, however, thought Philadelphians needed to know more about Mike, his service and sacrifice, and the act of valor that would make him the city’s only Medal of Honor recipient of the Vietnam War.Among the ideas proposed were renaming the Veterans of Foreign Wars Post in the Lawncrest section of Philly for Mike. An American Legion Post in Toms River, New Jersey, wanted to partner with local high school art students to create a mural honoring him. In Sea Isle City, New Jersey, another veteran thought a street should be named for Mike near where the family’s Shore house was. The Philadelphia Vietnam Veterans Memorial Society in the Bridesburg section of the city had plans to install a bronze plaque dedicated to him.

 There were two projects even more ambitious. One was a larger-than-life statue of Mike to be installed at the Philadelphia Vietnam Veterans Memorial. And one Vietnam vet made it his mission – a five-year mission, as it turned out – to have the Philadelphia VA Medical Center named for my brother.CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTERAll of these projects have been completed, thanks to the hard work and determination of the veteran community. Our family couldn’t be more grateful for all their efforts.Mike did not live long enough to become a veteran, but he would be as proud of them as they are of him.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Joe Crescenz wrote the foreword for the recently released book about his brother, ""No Greater Love: The Story of Michael Crescenz, Philadelphia’s Only Medal of Honor Recipient of the Vietnam War"" (Casemate).

 Facebook Twitter Instagram RSS Email Midterm Elections Published November 11, 2022 10:39am EST Who won the House? What you need to know about why it might take ‘weeks’ to be sure There are four slow-counting Western states where races could make or break the GOP takeover of the House 
 By
 Peter Kasperowicz | Fox News Facebook Twitter Flipboard Comments Print Email close Video Kevin McCarthy: I will work with anyone who wants to put America first House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy joined 'Jesse Watters Primetime' to discuss what investigations Republicans will begin if they take back the House. It is still not completely clear which party won control of the House of Representatives three days after the midterm election on Nov. 8, and it might still take weeks to find out for sure.House Republicans continue to operate under the assumption that they won a majority. But that majority will likely be slim, and slow vote counts in California, Arizona, Colorado and Oregon make it impossible to declare any result with certainty.According to the Fox News Decision Desk, Republicans had secured 211 House seats as of Friday morning, seven short of the 218 they need for a majority. Republicans are currently leading in enough outstanding House races to reach that goal.2022 MIDTERM ELECTION RESULTS 
 McCarthy has laid out Republicans' ""commitment to America"" as they try to regain control of the House of Representatives. 
 The biggest factor standing in the way of a clear result is the slow count in California, where more than a dozen House races have yet to be called. The final results in California could make or break the GOP takeover in the House – Republicans hold narrow leads in several of those races, but many of them have still tabulated fewer than 50% of the votes that have come in.According to a count provided late Thursday, more than 4.8 million ballots had yet to be processed. California’s Secretary of State Shirley Weber says it could still be weeks before it becomes clear who wins these races.""It typically takes weeks for counties to process and count all of the ballots,"" Weber’s office says on its website. ""Elections officials have approximately one month to complete their extensive tallying, auditing, and certification work (known as the official canvass).""MCCARTHY OFFICIALLY ANNOUNCES SPEAKER RUN, MAKING CASE TO FELLOW REPUBLICANS AFTER MIDTERMS MISS EXPECTATIONS 
 House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., says Republicans will take the House.
 (REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst)Under California law, mail-in ballots must be postmarked on or before Election Day, but can still be received by county election officials up to seven days after the election and still be counted.California state law says election officials must report their final results to Weber by Dec. 9.In Arizona, there are still two House races that have yet to be called, and a Republican is leading in one of them. However, just like California, Arizona still has many votes to count.According to Arizona’s Secretary of State Katie Hobbs, who is running for governor, more than 2 million ballots have been tabulated so far, but more than 500,000 remain.""Elections don’t end on Election Day,"" Hobb’s website states. ""It takes time to ensure all eligible votes are counted.""KEVIN MCCARTHY DECLARES GOP WILL TAKE MAJORITY IN THE HOUSE, PUSH OUT PELOSI AS SPEAKER 
 Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.) is one of several Republicans in tight races that have yet to be settled.
 (Photo by Michael B. Thomas/Getty Images)In Colorado, the results in two House races are not yet clear, including GOP incumbent Lauren Boebert’s close race against Democratic challenger Adam Frisch. As of Friday morning, Boebert was up a little more than 1,000 votes.According to Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold, every county in the state is still in a post-election reporting phase of the election as of Friday morning, and none had completed a final counting of ballots. It might still be some days before final results can be seen in this state.Finally, in Oregon, the fate of two close House races remains unclear, in part because that state will continue to count ballots by mail until Nov. 15. Under that state’s law, voters can file complaints about alleged election law violations as late as Nov. 21, and the very last day to resolve all ballot challenges is Nov. 29.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPAside from these four states, a small handful of other close House races are being delayed for various reasons, including waiting for mail-in ballot and absentee vote counts.

 Facebook Twitter Instagram RSS Email Celebrity News Published November 11, 2022 10:50am EST Bruce Willis and John Travolta reunite; ‘Paradise City’ actors share secrets from the set Blake Jenner and Praya Lundberg star alongside industry icons John Travolta and Bruce Willis in 'Paradise City' 
 By
 Lori A Bashian , Larry Fink | Fox News Facebook Twitter Flipboard Comments Print Email close Video Praya Lundberg talks learning from Bruce Willis and John Travolta on set Praya Lundberg discusses working with Bruce Willis and John Travolta on ""Paradise City,"" and what she learned from them on set.John Travolta and Bruce Willis have reunited for a new action film - nearly three decades after they costarred in 1994's ""Pulp Fiction."" Their young costars in ""Paradise City,"" Blake Jenner and Praya Lundberg, could not hold back their excitement when they found out they would be working with the movie legends.When speaking with Fox News Digital, Jenner and Lundberg revealed they both grew up watching their movies and look up to them as performers. It was particularly exciting for Lundberg, because this is her first movie in the United States, and she could not believe it was alongside Willis and Travolta.""What a dream come true. It's my first U.S. movie, and here I am having my coffee on set, acting across two incredible giants."" Lundberg said. ""I came from Bangkok, I'm not even from the U.S., here I am like, ‘I’m going to move to America, to begin my career, and then like two years later, I'm on a set saying, 'Good morning, John, Hi, Bruce. How are you?’ Yeah, it's amazing.""Jenner was equally excited to work with the iconic actors, but nothing could match his parents' excitement. He said the moment his parents found out he was going to work with them, his ""mother was just going nuts"" and asking if they could come to set and hang out with Willis. Jenner had to tell them to let him ""get there and make friends with everyone first."" 
 Praya Lundberg and Blake Jenner were extremely excited to work with Bruce Willis and John Travolta.
 (Getty Images)BRUCE WILLIS AND JOHN TRAVOLTA FACE OFF IN THE FIRST TRAILER FOR THIER NEW ACTION MOVIE ‘PARADISE CITY’In the film, Jenner plays Willis' son who is trying to find out what happened to his father after he went missing and was potentially killed. Meanwhile, Lundberg plays a local detective helping Jenner, and is also working to capture Travolta's character, who is an organized crime boss. The two made the most of every moment on set with Travolta and Willis.""I learned through observing them,"" Lundberg said. ""John is very aware of surroundings, himself, and it's almost like when he acts, it's a net. It flows so naturally, and it's just such an amazing presence to be around on set. He tries things off on the fly and just I watch him, and through watching, you absorb.""Jenner added, ""I definitely learned a lot from both of them because, A, I've seen like a ton of their movies as we all have, and then B, it was just kind of seeing them focus. I got jealous, you know, these guys can kind of turn it on, and with me still like kind of coming up and learning things, that kind of gives you something to work toward. I was definitely admiring the two of them the entire time. Their talent and their work ethic for sure.""As much as Jenner was looking forward to meeting Willis and Travolta, he did not want to come off as too green - ""like the new kid in school"" - so he refrained from asking for any specific advice. However, he told Fox News Digital he was still able to form a relationship with them both.""With Bruce it was cool because I kind of got to lock in… this kind of father-son kind of scene… So it was really nice to lock in and kind of feel that love with him,"" Jenner said. ""Then (with) John, I have a one-off scene and…we shot it on a night shoot. We had like one go at it. It was just incredible to see him play in rehearsals…you can tell how much he cares when he's rehearsing and how much he loves to play. So I think that was really cool to see."" 
 Bruce Willis plays Blake Jenner's father, a bounty hunter who goes missing.
 (Photo by VCG/VCG via Getty Images)In terms of preparing for their roles, Lundberg and Jenner had different processes. Lundberg focused on finding things about the character she related to, as well as getting into the mindset of a female police officer.""I did many Zooms with my friend's mother who works at the NYPD … And I wanted to understand, like when you enter a room, what goes through your brain first? What does one think,"" Lundberg asked. ""There's a scene where she goes in and makes an arrest in a quite a dangerous situation. I just want to understand mentally, what does someone in that situation think? How do they react?""Lundberg did not do any real-life ride-alongs with law enforcement out of fear she would get in the way get in the way of a real emergency, but she did take inspiration from other female detectives such as Olivia Benson from ""Law & Order: Special Victims Unit,"" played by Mariska Hargitay.  Video""I always love watching other actors' interpretation of what they see a character like this should be and then with all of the work I do on my own and real life research and examples, I create Savannah,"" Lundberg explained. ""Sometimes you just have to let it go on set. (A) little bit of magic happens when you don't try to make it too perfect.""To prepare for his role, Jenner says he watched ""some movies that kind of had a similar vibe"" while also trying to get in the mindset of his character and become friendly with everyone on set. A LOOK AT BRUCE WILLIS’ UPCOMING ACTING ROLE IN 'PARADISE CITY,’ HIS STORIED HOLLYWOOD CAREER 
 In preparation for her role, Praya Lundberg spoke with real-life female police officers and watched other on-screen police officers 
 (Photo by Rachpoot/Bauer-Griffin/GC Images)""I think we had like a good week of rehearsals, and before that I got my own exercises that I do, like stream of consciousness exercise where you kind of speak from the character's perspective and you kind of turn on hearing what they've been through, and then like working in rehearsals, talking to everybody. I think the main hallmark for any role is just getting comfortable with everybody,"" Jenner said.""Other than that, because I'd never done action and stuff, you kind of just have to buckle up and enjoy the ride. Now I know what to expect. If I were to do another role that required this much kind of movement and action and stunts and stuff…you kind of prepare for being prepared and then you just kind of buckle up and then do your best.""When it came to the physical demands of the role, Jenner compared it to being in boot camp, admitting to being sore when he would come home from filming. Lundberg, on the other hand, said her background in martial arts helped her in that area, but it was still difficult to get the choreography right and repeat it take after take.""Martial arts photography is like a dance, really a very mindful, meditative move. Every kick is thought out to come out cinematically as beautiful and as realistic as possible,"" Lundberg said. ""I do a lot of mindful work, meditative work, because you have to be fully aware of what you're doing so that you're cautious not to injure anyone on set too, and not to overly exert too much energy that if they had to take the same kick, you'd be able to do it.""Jenner, who got his start on ""Glee,"" also said he tries to ""soak up the moment so hard…because honestly, like, my first day on ‘Glee’ feels like it was yesterday.""CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER

 (Photo by FOX Image Collection via Getty Images)When it comes to Jenner and Lundberg's hopes for the audience when they watch ""Paradise City,"" Lundberg wants people to walk away thoroughly entertained by the film, and Jenner hopes they leave with a sense of gratitude for their loved ones who support them.""A film that has everything together, and it has action,"" Lundberg said. ""It has beautiful Maui, has many incredible actors, action sequences, the local energy of Hawaii, the loving energy, a love story between Savannah and someone, I will not say who, and it's just it's just a perfect action flick.""CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP""Call your parents and say, ‘Hey,’"" Jenner said. ""Don't let too much time go by … There's a lot of moments here where my character feels like he's alone. I don't think he expects to be greeted with the help and the love and the care that he's greeted with throughout this journey. So I think it's keep a small circle of people that you adore and trust because they're the ones that will always get you through things. That's definitely what I take away from watching the movie.""""Paradise City"" hits theaters Nov. 11.

 Facebook Twitter Instagram RSS Email OPINION Published November 11, 2022 10:52am EST Our veterans are made of grit, honor and duty that last a lifetime Helping others is a way of life for veterans as they aid their fellow service members in need 
 By
 Rep. Brian Mast | Fox News Facebook Twitter Flipboard Comments Print Email close Video Rep. Brian Mast: Our veterans show Americans what patriotism is all about Florida Rep. Brian Mast weighs in after President Biden said he will do 'nothing' different after the midterm election and shares his Veterans Day message on 'Fox & Friends.'NEWYou can now listen to Fox News articles!
 On September 19, 2010, a bomb detonated beneath my feet. I was sent flying, felt my teeth rattle inside my skull, and heard shouts of ""EOD is hit! EOD is down!"" through my earpiece. Soon after that bomb went off, my men moved across the battlefield — which was almost guaranteed to be rigged with more improvised explosive devices (IED) — to get to me. One even added his own tourniquet, in addition to the two I carried, to my legs to keep me from bleeding out. A sniper, a medic and two riflemen carried my stretcher through a river in order to get me to a medevac helicopter. With no fear, they put everything on the line to save my life.  There are few people in this world who would willingly cross a literal minefield to save someone’s life, but those who would are almost always veterans. Why? Because veterans are badasses.On Day 1, a recruit steps off the bus for basic training, knowing that the next few months will be hell. But it’s not about trying to make the recruits fail, it’s about proving that they can do incredibly hard things and overcome them and that they don’t shatter like a piece of glass. This is where Badass Training begins, and it works. Just ask any grunt in Sniper, Sapper, Pathfinder or Jump School; a Marine who’s completed the 54-hour Crucible; the sailor who finished Basic Underwater Demolition/SEAL training or the Airman who graduated from pararescue training. The training that service members go through is grueling, but it instills in them everything they need to be successful on the battlefield and in life: grit, honor and duty. Grit keeps us alive, honor keeps us human and duty drives us to accomplish the impossible.  FOX CORPORATION, U.S.VETS CONTINUE 'MAKE CAMO YOUR CAUSE' CAMPAIGN DEDICATED TO ENDING VETERAN HOMELESSNESSThose traits are hardened on the battlefield. I spent over a dozen years in the Army, serving as a bomb technician (Explosive Ordnance Disposal/EOD) and alongside the 75th Ranger Regiment, and I saw it in action. I’ve seen pilots land the tail end of a Chinook helicopter on the side of a mountain. I’ve seen teams kick in doors while terrorists fired 7.62mm rounds in their face. I’ve worked alongside bomb techs as the tip of the spear, clearing dozens of IEDs for our brothers behind us. We served shoulder to shoulder — some on our first deployment, some on our fifteenth — all because we were committed to ending the terrorists who had attacked America. Just like those who served in Vietnam and Korea, or Europe or the Pacific theater, we saw a threat to democracy, and we took the fight to our enemies.   
 Army veteran and Rep. Brian Mast represents the 18th Congressional District of Florida.
 Leaving the military doesn’t mean leaving our commitment to America behind. Those qualities — grit, honor and duty — stay with us, and our communities and our country are better for it. Veterans are the ones who step up when others want to run to safety. When thousands were stranded behind enemy lines in Afghanistan, retired Green Berets launched Operation Pineapple Express. When Russian President Vladimir Putin launched his attack on a sovereign democracy, Special Operation veterans volunteered to train Ukrainian troops on the front lines. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER But you don’t have to look overseas for examples of our veterans continuing the fight; veterans run through walls for their fellow Americans every day. I could name dozens of veterans who have started nonprofits just in my area in Florida. George Brady founded Right Side Fishing in Jensen Beach to connect disabled veterans with fishing and boating excursions. Michael Durkee runs Wounded Warrior Relief Fund to provide emergency financial support to veterans in need. A former SEAL Team Six Commander, Rick Kaiser, runs the National Navy SEAL Museum in Fort Pierce. Just like none of us signed up in order to get a pat on the back or a medal on our chest, none of these men do what they do for kudos or publicity, they do it because service is a way of life, and they wouldn’t want to live any other way.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPIt’s Veterans Day, which I also like to call Badass Day, and it’s a great opportunity to thank those who have served, but I want to make sure folks know just what they’re saying ‘thank you’ for. From the moment they put on camo for the first time, soldiers, sailors, Airmen, Marines, Coast Guardsmen and Guardians are pushed to the limit and stop at nothing to make this country the best it can be. And that dedication becomes as natural as taking a breath. It stays with them throughout their entire life and inspires the next generation who is lucky enough to get to know the greatest group of badasses on earth.  CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM REP. BRIAN MAST Republican Brian Mast represents Florida's 18th District in the U.S. House of Representatives. He served in the U.S. Army from 2000 to 2011.

Since the administration's announcement, a handful of legal challenges have been filed in courts across the nation, as states and advocacy groups work to halt Biden's plan.Carrie Severino, president of the Judicial Crisis Network, told Fox News Digital that challenges to the president's student loan handout is a case the Supreme Court ""ought"" to take up.BIDEN'S STUDENT LOAN HANDOUT STRUCK DOWN BY FEDERAL JUDGE IN TEXAS 
 Since the administration's announcement, a handful of legal challenges have been filed in courts across the nation as states and advocacy groups work to halt President Biden's plan.
 (Ting Shen/Bloomberg via Getty Images)""This is a classic area that the court has been looking at a lot lately, in part because we have seen administrations like the Biden administration that are reaching beyond their authority,"" Severino said.""So the way that this is being done is exactly the type of behavior that the court has had to smack down on several occasions,"" she continued, citing the eviction moratorium and nationwide COVID-19 vaccine mandates as examples where the Supreme Court intervened and struck down administration policies. ""The student loan forgiveness is the same kind of thing.""""By the president's own admission, the COVID crisis is over. And yet now we're suddenly declaring a state of emergency to achieve one of his goals, which is simply a policy goal,"" she said, noting that in order to constitutionally achieve his goal he would have to go through Congress. ""He knows he doesn't have the support of the legislature. So it's just ‘whatever I can do to get around that.' And the court has been our backstop, or constitutional policing of those boundaries. And so I think that's hopefully something the court will step into to police here as well.""STUDENT LOAN HANDOUT: NEW LAWSUIT SAYS BIDEN DIDN'T FOLLOW ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURESMissouri led Arkansas, Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska and South Carolina in filing a lawsuit to challenge the program, claiming that the Department of Education lacks the authority to cancel debt to this degree. 
 President Biden's student loan handout plan would cost taxpayers more than $400 billion.
 (Al Drago/Bloomberg via Getty Images)O.H. Skinner, executive director of the Alliance for Consumers, told Fox News Digital that he believes the case led by Missouri has the strongest chance of knocking down Biden's plan.""I think that this is the only ticket in my mind. I don't think there is another viable to take down the student loan bailout provision. And I think they have a really strong argument, and their argument is strong enough to take it to the Supreme Court. And I think if the Supreme Court takes it, then it's going to go down in flames,"" Skinner said.""And so I think this is an example where without the states pushing, I don't think this happens. But because you have strong, principled, conservative state [attorneys general] pushing for the rule of law, you're going to see a big win for the rule of law here at some point in the next 18 months,"" Skinner continued. 
 A federal judge in Texas struck down President Biden's student loan handout in a Thursday night ruling.
 (Nathan Howard/Getty Images)WHITE HOUSE TEASES STUDENT LOAN HANDOUT APPLICATION FORMA federal judge in Texas struck down President Biden's student loan handout in a Thursday night ruling in a case brought by the Job Creators Network Foundation. The suit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas, argues that the plaintiffs were denied due process under the Administrative Procedure Act to object to the move during a comment period.""Whether the Program constitutes good public policy is not the role of this Court to determine. Still, no one can plausibly deny that it is either one of the largest delegations of legislative power to the executive branch, or one of the largest exercises of legislative power without congressional authority in the history of the United States,"" United States District Judge Mark Pittman wrote Thursday.The Department of Justice said Friday that it will appeal the decision.

The cathedral is the residence of Timothy Cardinal Dolan, a prominent Catholic prelate.A spokesperson for the Archdiocese of New York told Fox News Digital that three people – two staff members and a priest who also live there – were inside the residence at the time, but Dolan was not. The spokesperson said that no one was hurt at the time. Investigators later revealed that they suspect Velez is also behind two more incidents, which occurred on Saturday. 
 NYC police have identified 28-year-old Juan Velez as being the suspect behind three attacks on Manhattan houses of worship, including the private residence of Cardinal Dolan.

Asa Hutchinson on Thursday recommended that lawmakers increase public school funding by $550 million over the next two years to raise teacher pay, as the Republican prepares to leave office in January.Hutchinson presented his budget recommendations to a legislative panel days after Republican Sarah Huckabee Sanders was elected the state's next governor. Hutchinson, who was barred by term limits from seeking reelection, acknowledged that the decision on the budget will be up to the Legislature and Sanders next year.Hutchinson said his funding proposal ""allows the next administration and the General Assembly maximum flexibility in terms of raising teacher salaries and raising the outcomes for education in the state.""ARKANSAS DRUG AND FIREARM INVESTIGATIONS LEAD TO 80 INDICTMENTS, INCLUDING RAPPERThe proposal calls for increasing public school funding by $200 million in the fiscal year that begins July 2023 and by $350 million the following year.Hutchinson earlier this year called on lawmakers to raise teacher pay, but decided against putting it on the agenda for a special session in August due to a lack of support in the majority-Republican Legislature.The House and Senate education committees have since endorsed proposals to give teachers $4,000 raises, though they differ on when the raises should be granted. 
 Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson speaks to the press at the White House in Washington, DC, on Jan. 31, 2022. Hutchinson recently called for an increase in public school funding in the state of Arkansas.

The budget proposal projects the state will end that year with a nearly $255 million surplus.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPHutchinson, who has clashed with the Legislature in recent years on issues such as a ban on transgender medical care and COVID-19 restrictions, alluded to the at-times rocky relationship as he addressed lawmakers.""When iron strikes iron, what do you get?

C.Q. Brown Jr. is warning that the military must change if it wants to stay ahead of China and Russia, stating the ""threat we were up against is not the threat we'll see in the future.""In an interview with Voice of America (VOA), Brown said ""our adversaries have continued to advance their capabilities at the same time we’ve been using some of the same capabilities we’ve been using for the past 30 years.""Because of that, Brown said ""we've got to change.""One change coming to the Air Force will be unveiled on Dec. 2 when the branch reveals its new B-21 stealth bomber, which will replace the B-1 and B-2 bombers that have been around since the 1980s.VETERANS DAY AND ITS HISTORY: 6 KEY FACTS TO KNOW

 By
 Alfredo Ortiz | Fox News Facebook Twitter Flipboard Comments Print Email close Video Newt Gingrich: The shift of power in the House will be decisive Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich weighs in as the Georgia Senate race heads to a runoff and discusses Rep. McCarthy's bid for speaker of the House. NEWYou can now listen to Fox News articles!
 The era of bigger and bigger government is over – at least for the foreseeable future.Republicans did what they needed to do on Election Day. They have seemingly retaken the House of Representatives, picking up around ten seats, ushering in divided government. The House GOP offers a welcome bulwark against destructive leftist policies.That means the end of Democrats' reckless spending that's fueling the inflationary fire burning holes in Americans' pockets. It means tax increases, radical labor law rewrites, and other destructive far-left legislative proposals are off the table. Small business owners are breathing a sigh of relief.Republicans also still have a path to retaking the Senate. If Nevada Republican Senate candidate Adam Laxalt can maintain his lead, Senate control will be determined (as in 2020) by the Georgia runoff election in December.JOHN TILLMAN: FOUR WAYS REPUBLICANS CAN BEGIN TO TURN OUR COUNTRY AROUND BY 2024 VideoIf the GOP can thread this Senate needle, it can also offer a check against the confirmation of Biden's activist judges who would rubber-stamp his executive overreach. This control is especially important as Biden will increasingly resort to executive orders over the next two years to try to implement his agenda in the face of a divided government.Republicans' performance on Election Day was a victory for small businesses, the economy, and the country. Voters made their voices heard that they want an end to progressive control of the government. Yet it's also a disappointment that no red wave materialized to more fully repudiate Biden and Congressional Democrats' failures over the last two years.Part of the reason for Republicans' relatively few House pickups (at least by historical midterm standards) is prosaic: The GOP got a head start in 2020 when it gained 14 House seats. Those wins, combined with this cycle's, make the overall performance more impressive.As I predicted, Republicans narrowed Democrats' lead among Hispanics – but not by enough. The GOP must continue targeting this growing demographic of (in the words of Ronald Reagan) Republicans who don't know it yet to eliminate the remaining Hispanic partisan gap. VideoDemocrats also ran up the score among white female college graduates and non-married women, whom they won by 14 and 37 points, respectively, according to exit polls. The Democrats' shameful demagoguery of abortion clearly had an impact. So did their dirty primary tricks elevating Republican candidates unpopular with this demographic.Perhaps the biggest bright spot for Republicans this election was the resounding victories from governors who successfully managed a once-in-a-century pandemic and a challenging economic environment. For instance, Govs. Brian Kemp (GA) and Ron DeSantis (FL) dramatically outperformed their 2018 totals and other Republicans despite coming under withering scrutiny over their Covid-19 response. Govs. Kim Reynolds (IA) and Kristi Noem (SD) also had big nights.CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTERVoters rewarded these governors for resisting pressure from the Biden administration, media, and various ""experts"" to close their economies and put onerous restrictions on small businesses. They kept their economies open and empowered their small businesses with sound policies to allow them to flourish despite historic challenges. And they have been vindicated for it. VideoCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPConfidently standing up for free markets and fighting back against woke culture as these governors have done is a recipe to break through the country's partisan balkanization. These state laboratories of democracy, which Job Creators Network has been highlighting as part of its Great Opportunity Project, reveal the best path forward to jumpstart the national economy and provide a template for other pro-small business policymakers and candidates to follow.  The first step in a national economic turnaround is stopping the bad policy from Washington. Republicans accomplished this on Election Day. The next step is building momentum by copying victorious GOP governors. By working off the same successful playbook, Republicans can achieve lasting victories against big government and unleash shared economic prosperity for years to come. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM ALFREDO ORTIZ Alfredo Ortiz is President and CEO of the Job Creators Network, a non-partisan organization founded by entrepreneurs.

 Facebook Twitter Instagram RSS Email Midterm Elections Published November 11, 2022 9:13am EST Nevada Senate race: Laxalt lead over Cortez Masto shrinks after latest vote count update Control of Senate in the balance as Nevada counts votes in Laxalt-Cortez Masto 2022 Senate race 
 By
 Chris Pandolfo , Lee Ross | Fox News Facebook Twitter Flipboard Comments Print Email close Video Adam Laxalt speaks to Tucker on the state of his Nevada Senate race Nevada U.S. senate candidate Adam Laxalt says the system is 'very, very flawed' as votes continue to trickle in days after election day on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.' Nevada Republican Adam Laxalt's lead over incumbent Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, D-Nev., has shrunk to fewer than 9,000 votes as officials are still counting mail-in ballots in the state's largest counties. The latest updates from Clark and Washoe counties have put Laxalt just 8,988 votes over Cortez Masto, less than 1% of the total vote. Election officials said Wednesday that ballot counting will continue through next week, but the majority of the ballots could be counted by today.  Officials explained that mail-in ballots must be postmarked by Election Day but can arrive as late as Saturday to be counted. Election officials have been flooded with thousands of them since Tuesday as the margins between Cortez Masto and Laxalt remain tight. More than 12,000 ballots from Clark County were counted Thursday night, helping Cortez Masto gain 3,285 votes on Laxalt. The city of Las Vegas resides within the county, and Democrats have a nearly 10-point advantage over Republicans in voter registration there. The Republican challenger's lead grew by about 1,000 votes as ballots were counted from surrounding rural counties, but the gain was not enough to offset the mail-in votes for the Democratic senator.FOX NEWS FOLLOWS SENATE CANDIDATE ADAM LAXALT 1,100 MILES ACROSS NEVADA AS HE TARGETS RURAL VOTERS 
 Ballots are processed by bipartisan election workers at the Clark County Election Department during the ongoing election process on Nov. 10, 2022, in North Las Vegas, Nevada.
 (Mario Tama/Getty Images)Washoe County, the state's second-most populous county, counted more than 18,000 ballots overnight Thursday and gave Cortez Masto a net gain of 4,817 votes against Laxalt. Democrats have strong support in Reno and Sparks, but the rest of the county leans Republican, making it competitive. Officials in Clark County, Nevada's most populous county, have said that Tuesday, Nov. 15, is the deadline to verify the mail-in ballots, while Nov. 17 is the latest date they will release the final results.As the Nevada Senate race stands now, Laxalt currently has 450,534 votes (48.97%) to be the next senator from Nevada, while Cortez Masto holds 441,546 votes (48%) for re-election with 90.2% of the vote reported. A GUIDE TO THE FOX NEWS 2022 ELECTIONS EXPERIENCE 
 Nevada Republican Senate nominee Adam Laxalt speaks at a Republican midterm election night party at Red Rock Casino on Nov. 8, 2022, in Las Vegas.
 (Mario Tama/Getty Images)Nevada's race for governor is also tight. Republican Joe Lombardo currently holds a 28,543 vote lead over incumbent Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak (49.7% to 46.6%, respectively). There appears to be many split-ticket voters, as Lombardo has more support in the gubernatorial contest than Laxalt does in the Senate race, while Cortez Masto has earned more votes in her re-election bid for Senate than Sisolak has for governor. Nevada does not have an automatic recount law. If the races remain close, the eventual loser must request a recount no later than three business days after the canvas of the vote. The candidate who requests a recount must pay for the associated costs unless the recount changes the election result in their favor, in which case the requester is refunded any costs paid, according to state law.  MCCARTHY OFFICIALLY ANNOUNCES SPEAKER RUN, MAKING CASE TO FELLOW REPUBLICANS AFTER MIDTERMS MISS EXPECTATIONS 
 U.S. Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto speaks at an election night party hosted by Nevada Democratic Victory at The Encore on Nov. 8, 2022, in Las Vegas.
 (Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)If Cortez Masto goes on to win, but Sisolak loses, the election would likely be a referendum on the governor's deeply unpopular decision to shut down Nevada's casinos during the pandemic. Sisolak's COVID-19 policies sent unemployment in Nevada skyrocketing to over 28% – the highest unemployment rate recorded in any state since the Great Depression. His subsequent orders on mask mandates and school closures have also been unpopular with state residents.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPStill, the fact that the gubernatorial and senate races are so close has disappointed Republicans, and lackluster GOP turnout helped Democrats hold on to three U.S. House seats Republicans had hoped to flip. Fox News' Brandon Gillespie contributed to this report.  Chris Pandolfo is a writer for Fox News Digital.

 Facebook Twitter Instagram RSS Email Fox News Flash Published November 11, 2022 8:00am EST Gingrich calls for postmortem review of midterms, lauds GOP for reportedly winning popular vote Key races in Nevada, Arizona, California and Maryland remain uncalled 
 By
 Charles Creitz | Fox News Facebook Twitter Flipboard Comments Print Email close Video Newt Gingrich analyzes the state of the post-midterm counts Votes remain outstanding in California, Arizona, Nevada and Maryland; former House Speaker reacts on 'Hannity.' Republicans may have won the popular vote nationwide in the 2022 midterms, though that figure did not translate into a GOP sweep as predicted by several observers, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich said Thursday.Gingrich also said there should be a postmortem-type review of where the GOP could improve and what it got right in the midterm election, similar to how the RNC has done in past races.""I look at this and there's so many questions – in 2014 when we won, Reince Priebus who was the Republican National Committee chairman, asked me to develop a review –  even though we had won –  to try to figure it out. And I think that Ronna McDaniel, the chair of the RNC, ought to set up a similar review committee,"" he said.""There's so many questions that we need to get answered,"" Gingrich added, pointing to reports that House Republicans earned 6 million more net votes as of Thursday than their Democratic competitors despite more anemic gains than predicted.GROWING ‘SQUAD’ RIPPED FOR HAVING NO SOLUTIONS 
 Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto and Republican Adam Laxalt.
 (Associated Press) ""We need to examine that. Apparently, some incumbents lost who shouldn't have. We should examine that. No incumbent lost in 2020 with Kevin McCarthy's leadership and no Republican lost in 1994 when we took the House.""Gingrich said the 6 million reported popular vote margin – which he said is likely to shrink somewhat as California returns continue to come in – should be a key facet of that investigation.""We had five or 6 million more votes and we don't pick up a whole bunch of seats. We need to analyze that. I mean, there's something going on out there that we don't understand,"" he said.""But, I can't wait for the moment where Pelosi has to hand… Kevin McCarthy the gavel and the degree to which in committees and investigations and scheduling things, all of a sudden you're in a totally different House.""KARI LAKE SLAMS CHAOTIC ARIZONA ELECTION TABULATION AS SHE CLOSES GAP ON HOBBS 
 The race between GOP candidate Kari Lake and Democrat Katie Hobbs is still undecided.
 With votes still continuing to be counted in states like Maryland, California, Nevada and Arizona, Gingrich said Republicans remain poised to take the House and potentially gain a 1-seat majority in the Senate – especially if Nevada's Adam Laxalt comes out victorious and Georgia's Herschel Walker wins an upcoming runoff.In otherwise blue Maryland – which saw its governorship flip from Republican to Democrat – State Del. Neil Parrott, R-Hagerstown, leads incumbent Rep. David Trone by about one point with more than 90% reporting. A win by Parrott would be another plus-one notch for House Republicans, and he would join the state's longtime lone House Republican Dr. Andy Harris of the Eastern Shore district.MIDTERMS SHOWED VOTERS LACK ‘HATRED’ FOR BIDEN THAT CLINTONS AND OBAMA DREW

Mark Kelly by a larger margin than Republican gubernatorial hopeful Kari Lake trails Secretary of State Katie Hobbs.In Nevada, Republican Adam Laxalt and Sen. Catherine Cortez-Masto, D-Nev., are separated by a razor-thin margin as votes come in in tranches from Clark County and elsewhere.""I think Adam is going to win,"" Gingrich said on ""Hannity."" ""I think now that Blake Masters is going to win and I look at what's happening with Kari Lake: She's going to win. We're going to end up by the time this is over, every effort of the news media to make Republicans feel bad is going to fall apart.""CLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP""And remember, the biggest change in Washington will be when Nancy Pelosi hands that gavel over to Kevin McCarthy. You go from a radical liberal to a solid conservative. That is the biggest single change.""Gingrich said Joe Biden's celebratory press conference on Wednesday showed the president ""has no idea what's going on"" and is likely to continue his far-left governing position.
