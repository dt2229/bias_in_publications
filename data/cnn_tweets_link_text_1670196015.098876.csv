White teacher in Texas fired after telling students his race is ‘the superior one’
By Andi Babineau, CNN
Published 1:43 AM EST, Tue November 15, 2022
A White teacher in Pflugerville, Texas, has been fired following an ""inappropriate conversation"" with students, school officials said.
From Google
CNN
 — 
A middle school teacher in Pflugerville, Texas, has been fired, district officials said Monday, after video was posted to social media showing the White teacher tell his students his race “is the superior one.”
“Last Friday, Nov. 11, Pflugerville ISD officials were made aware of an inappropriate conversation a teacher at Bohls Middle School had with students during an advisory class,” Pflugerville Independent School District (PfISD) Superintendent Dr. Douglas Killian wrote in a statement. “As of Monday morning, Nov. 14, the teacher in question is no longer employed by Pflugerville ISD and we are actively looking for a replacement,” the statement said.
Videos of the conversation in question were posted to social media last week.
In one video, the teacher can be seen saying to his multi-racial class, “Deep down in my heart, I’m ethnocentric, which means I think my race is the superior one,” as students audibly react both on- and off-camera.
Maryland authorities investigating why a teacher falsely reported multiple stabbings at a school before taking a class of students off campus
A student off camera asks, “So White is better than all?”
The teacher replies, “Let me finish. I think everybody thinks that. They’re just not honest about it.”
After some other discussion in the video, a student asks, “You said you are a racist, right?”
“I did, yeah, I’m trying to be honest,” the teacher replies.
It is unclear what was discussed before and after the recording of the videos.
CNN has not identified the person or people who filmed the videos circulating online and has not obtained the videos. CNN has obtained an audio recording of a portion of the conversation from a parent who said their child is shown in the videos.
In the audio, a student asks the teacher to repeat himself. The teacher says, “I said, ‘I am a racist.’ That’s what I said. Do you know what that means?”
Students’ responses overlap, and the teacher continues, “It means that deep down in my heart, I think my race is the superior race. That’s what it means to be a racist.”
The teacher in question has not been identified by PfISD, nor has the district provided any additional context surrounding the conversation.
“We want to reiterate that this conversation does not align with our core beliefs and is not a reflection of our district or our culture at Bohls Middle School,” Killian said in his statement. “The advisory discussion was inappropriate, inaccurate, and unacceptable; and this type of interaction will not be tolerated in any PfISD schools.”
The superintendent went on to apologize to students and families for any “undue stress or concern” caused by the comments, and to parents whose children were seen in the video without their knowledge.
The teacher, who was identified to CNN by the parent, did not immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment.

Is the worst over for bitcoin and the rest of crypto?

 — 
The crypto industry is still reeling from last week’s shocking death spiral of digital currency exchange FTX. The company’s bankruptcy filing has left financial backers in the lurch — including the usual suspects in Silicon Valley, from Masayoshi Son’s SoftBank to VC firm Sequoia.
A few names on the list stand out, though. The Ontario Teachers Pension Plan was invested in the company. The Alaska Permanent Fund Corp, The Washington State Investment Board and others were indirect investors in FTX through Sequoia and other venture capital firms. While these funds say they had limited exposure to FTX, their inclusion points to a growing but alarming trend that could affect you even if you’re not a buyer of crypto yourself.
What’s happening: Pension funds are increasingly investing in alternative assets in search of bigger returns. Crypto is one example — and that could be risky for anyone invested in them.
In the United States, public pension funds are facing serious challenges that threaten the retirement plans of millions of state and local government employees.
The 100 largest public pension funds in the United States had been funded at just 69.3% of their total obligations at the close of the third quarter, down from 85.5% at the end of 2021 according to analysis by Milliman, an actuarial and consulting firm.
That means that these funds have a gap between the cash they’re holding and the cost of the benefits promised to both retired and soon-to-retire workers. In order to stay afloat, they have to make it up somehow. Raising taxes or re-balancing budgets pose political problems, and so many are instead attempting to juice returns by investing in riskier and more illiquid alternatives to stocks and bonds like cryptocurrency, private equity, and hedge funds.
“This really shines a bright light on what money managers are doing to try to achieve a higher rate of return. It’s not just about crypto as much as just their overall increased tolerance and appetite for these alternative asset classes,” said Matthew Eickman, national practice leader at Prime Capital Investments.
Riskier investments, bigger rewards? Of the roughly $4 trillion in assets managed by public pension funds in the United States, about one-quarter is allocated to risky alternative vehicles, including private equity, real estate, and hedge funds, according to the Boston College Center for Retirement Research. That’s up from 8% when they began measuring in 2001.
It’s not just a trend that’s happening in the United States. Pension assets allocated to real estate, private equity and infrastructure have increased from 7% to over 26% in the past two decades globally, according to Willis Towers Watson’s Thinking Ahead Institute.
But as the FTX debacle showed, risky investments can further erode the already damaged pension landscape. These alternative investments are often complicated, have high fees and are more volatile than stocks.
Portfolio managers are investing in “opaque investment strategies that we do not have sufficient understanding of that could create large problems in the future,” said Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at audit and tax and consulting firm RSM US. “My fear lies in these known unknowns.”
The silver lining: It’s been a tough year for markets, and a lot of pension funds are getting battered, which puts them in a position to look into increasing their stake in non-market investments, said Eickman.
But the recent events could prompt them to think twice. “What’s happened with FTX probably will introduce additional caution into those discussions,” he said.
The Fed delivers a confusing message
US markets snapped a two-day rally and closed lower on Monday after Fed governor Christopher Waller warned that the endpoint for rate hikes by the central bank is “still a ways out there.”
“We’re at a point where we can start thinking maybe of going at a slower pace,” Waller said at a conference organized by UBS in Australia. But he warned investors that the Fed was not softening its fight on inflation. “Quit paying attention to the pace and start paying attention to where the endpoint is going to be. Until we get inflation down, that endpoint is still a ways out there.”
The comments came after a report released last week showed that inflation in October was lower than expected. Investors seized onto the data as a sign that the Fed could soon pivot away from historically high rate hikes, and markets had their best day since the spring of 2020.
The CPI inflation report was “good news,” said Waller, but it’s “just one data point” and more readings are needed to convince policymakers that inflation rates are easing.
Mixed messaging: Stocks rebounded from session lows on Monday after another Fed official delivered a somewhat different message. Federal Reserve Vice Chair Lael Brainard indicated the central bank could soon slow the pace of its interest rate increases on Monday.
“I think it will probably be appropriate soon to move to a slower pace of rate increases,” she told Bloomberg News in a live interview. “We have raised rates very rapidly,” she said. “We’ve been reducing the balance sheet, and you can see that in financial conditions, you can see that in inflation expectations, which are quite well-anchored,” she said.
The bottom line: Markets could remain volatile until rate hikes end. Investors will search deeply for clues about future Fed policy in the Producer Price Index report on Tuesday, the retail sales report on Wednesday, and the Philly Fed manufacturing index on Thursday. But it’s best not to fight the Fed: When officials say one piece of data won’t sway their policy-making process, they mean it.
Biden and Xi meet during G20 summit
President Joe Biden held a three-hour talk Monday with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping, their first in-person encounter since Biden took office, report my colleagues Kevin Liptak and MJ Lee. The meeting comes at a time of deteriorating relations between China and the US.
Emerging afterward, Biden told reporters he was “open and candid” with Xi about the range of matters where Beijing and Washington disagree. “I’m not suggesting this is kumbaya,” Biden said at a news conference, “but I do not believe there’s a need for concern, as one of you raised a legitimate question [about] a new Cold War.”
Economic relations: Xi reportedly criticized the US for attempting to build “walls and barriers,” and pushing for “decoupling and severing supply chains,” during the meeting. “We oppose politicizing and weaponizing economic and trade ties as well as exchanges in science and technology,” he said.
A White House readout said that “(Biden) reiterated that (US-China) competition should not veer into conflict and underscored that the United States and China must manage the competition responsibly and maintain open lines of communication,” the statement said, adding that the leaders asked their teams to carry this work forward.
Markets encouraged: Stocks in mainland China and Hong Kong got a lift Tuesday, my colleague Laura He reports. Analysts said the unexpectedly constructive tone of the meeting boosted sentiment. The meeting had sent a positive message that the two sides would strive to find common ground, they added.
What’s next: The US will send Secretary of State Antony Blinken to visit China to follow up on their discussions, said the White House.

Airlines forced to pay more than $600 million in refunds to passengers amid pandemic woes
By Geneva Sands and Pete Muntean, CNN

 — 
Airlines have paid more than $600 million in refunds to hundreds of thousands of passengers for canceled or changed flights since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Department of Transportation announced Monday.
At the same time, federal regulators are cracking down on a half-dozen airlines they say skirted rules, which determine when refunds are issued. This all comes as airlines are struggling to keep up with a rapid rise in demand for air travel.
The department is also issuing $7.25 million in fines against the six airlines for the “extreme delays in providing those refunds to passengers,” Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said on a call with reporters.
That brings the total assessed fines for 2022 to $8.1 million – a record in civil penalties for the department’s consumer protection program.
Ultra low-cost carrier Frontier Airlines is the only US airline to face fines related to refunds. Foreign based carriers face the majority of fines: Air India, TAP Portugal, Aeromexico, El Al and Avianca.
“[T]he department’s expectation that when Americans buy a ticket on an airline, we expect to get to our destination safely reliably and affordably. And our job at DOT is to hold airlines accountable for these expectations, many of which are a matter of law and regulation,” Buttigieg said.
Last month, the Department of Transportation said of the 7,243 consumer complaints received about the airlines in August, almost one in every five concerned refunds.
The process of getting airlines to issue refunds varied by airline, according to Blane Workie, DOT assistant general counsel for the Office of Aviation Consumer Protection, who spoke on the call with Buttigieg.
For example, Frontier, changed its definition of “significant schedule change” in March 2020.
“In essence, they were retroactively applying a more stringent rule to consumers, and I can certainly say that Frontier would not have provided these refunds to tens of thousands of passengers if DOT had not been involved,” she said.
As part of the process, DOT required that Frontier provide the required refunds or inform all those passengers on how to obtain refunds in case they need to fill out forms.
Other airlines had extreme delays in providing refunds, Workie said.
Most of the refund complaints that the department has received have been against foreign air carriers, noted Workie.
Asked if this would serve as a deterrent to airlines, Buttigieg said, the “overall objective is to make sure passengers get their money back.”
“It shouldn’t take an enforcement action from the US Department of Transportation to get airlines to pay refunds that they’re required to pay. And so, I have asked the team to undertake an exercise to make sure that the fines are calibrated to deter this in the future and save passengers a lot of time and save everybody a lot,” he said.
Buttigieg later noted that the department will continue “ratcheting up the penalty side” until they see less of this kind of behavior.
All refunds have either been made or consumers should have been informed of the refund process, according to Workie.
However, the fines will be collected after DOT orders are issued on Monday.
There are more enforcement actions and investigations underway, according to Buttigieg, who said that “there may be more news to come by way of fines.”
However, Workie said there are no pending refund investigations against US airlines.
Buttigieg also noted the upcoming holiday travel season, saying that it is expected to be “among the busiest” since 2019, in terms of busy travel days.
He touted other actions taken by the department, including a new airline consumer service dashboard to help people see what they are owed when a flight is canceled or delayed because of an airline issue.

CNN Business
 — 
Amazon is planning to lay off some 10,000 employees in corporate and technology jobs, the New York Times reported on Monday, citing anonymous sources with knowledge of the matter.
The job cuts could start as early as this week, and will likely include staff working on Amazon (AMZN) devices (such as its voice-assistant Alexa), as well as people in its retail and human resources divisions, according to the report. “The total number of layoffs remains fluid,” the report stated.
Amazon did not immediately respond to CNN Business’ request for comment Monday. CNN has not been able to independently confirm the report. The Wall Street Journal also reported Monday that Amazon is set to lay off thousands of workers, citing a person familiar with the matter.
Silicon Valley's greatest minds misread pandemic demand. Now their employees are paying for it.
The news would make Amazon the latest in a spate of tech companies that have announced significant layoffs in recent weeks, amid broader economic uncertainty and a sharp slowdown in the demand many tech giants saw during the pandemic that led them to quickly add staff. Last week, Facebook-parent Meta announced it is laying off 11,000 employees.
Earlier this month, Amazon said it was freezing corporate hiring “for the next few months,” citing economic uncertainty and “how many people we have hired” in recent years. Amazon rapidly grew its headcount as the pandemic shifted consumer habits and spending towards e-commerce. In its most-recent earnings report, however, Amazon forecast its revenue for the holiday quarter would be lighter than analysts had expected.
Shares in Amazon have fallen more than 40% in 2022 so far amid a broader market decline.
News of potential layoffs comes at a crucial time for the retail industry, ahead of the holiday shopping season. Despite recession fears and inflationary pressures, the National Retail Federation is predicting a 6% to 8% sales increase from last year during the holiday shopping months.
Last month, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos tweeted about the possibility of a looming recession, writing, “the probabilities in this economy tell you to batten down the hatches.” In an interview with CNN’s Chloe Melas on Saturday, Bezos said that advice was meant for business owners and consumers alike. “Take some risk off the table,” he said. “Just a little bit of risk reduction could make the difference.”

Unfortunately, this is what the Federal Reserve is trying to achieve by force with their aggressive interest rate hikes. They need unemployment to go back up to 6-7% because their inflation remedy wasn’t working.

Why Planet Fitness hasn’t raised its $10 monthly gym price in 30 years
By Nathaniel Meyersohn, CNN Business

 — 
A gym membership in the United States typically costs around $50 a month. Boutique gyms and high-intensity classes run double and triple that.
Planet Fitness, however, has offered $10 monthly memberships for 30 years. The no-frills gym chain hasn’t raised the price, making it one of the few things that still costs the same despite the highest inflation in decades.
Planet Fitness blares out the $10 gym plan, which includes annual fees and free training, in commercials, and the company has long sponsored the New Year’s Eve celebration in Times Square to get people thinking about signing up for memberships as their resolution.
That almost sacrosanct $10 price has become a key part of the company’s brand positioning as an accessible, “judgment-free” club conducive to casual gym goers. Planet Fitness members typically go five or six times a month, and around 60% of them don’t visit in a 30-day stretch.
“It’s a very powerful marketing tool,” said Simeon Siegel, who covers the company at BMO Capital Markets. The $10 price is right in the sweet spot, he said: cheap enough to draw people to Planet Fitness who want to get in shape and, equally as important, not so expensive that they will cancel if they don’t go often.
For $10 a month, infrequent users are likelier to hold onto the membership to say they belong to a gym rather than quit, he said.

Planet Fitness uses $10 dues, which can be canceled at anytime, to recruit people who are interested in exercising, but have never joined a gym before, are intimidated by fitness fanatics at other gyms or can’t afford pricier clubs. The company believes $10 is an entryway for the roughly 80% of Americans who don’t belong to a gym.
This inexpensive gym membership model – known in the fitness industry as high volume, low price, or “HVLP” – is also tailored to appeal to high-school students accompanied by a parent, college students and people recovering from an injury or surgery, said Rick Caro, the president of Management Vision and longtime fitness industry consultant.
“It’s a ‘get you off the couch’ price,” said Christopher Rondeau, the chief executive of Planet Fitness (PLNT), which has grown to more than 2,300 gyms nationwide and reached a record-high 16.6 million members last quarter. “You’re not going to give something a try for the first time and spend $50, $60, $70,” he said.
Planet Fitness does not plan to raise the $10 price anytime soon. Instead, it will hold down the price by getting people to trade up to its $24.99 monthly “Black Card” membership with more perks.
“The longer I can stay at $10 the better off I am to get people off the couch, give fitness a try and continue to drive more value in the Black Card,” said Rondeau.
The higher-priced monthly plan offers access to all of Planet Fitness’ gyms and perks like water massage beds, massage chairs and tanning equipment, and Black Card members can also bring a visitor.
Why Costco's $1.50 hot dog combo and 99-cent Arizona iced tea still cost the same
More than 60% of members subscribe to this tier, which Planet Fitness increased by $2 a month earlier in the year. The average Planet Fitness member pays around $17.60 a month, helping the company keep the lower plan at $10.
“It’s not that different from other businesses that entice you with a low price point and then upsell you with higher options,” said Joseph Altobello, an analyst at Raymond James.
To appeal to occasional gym goers, Planet Fitness’ clubs also have more cardio and light strength equipment than many competitors and fewer heavy free weights. Planet Fitness discourages what it calls “lunk” behavior, such as dropping weights and grunting, and has a “lunk alarm” to prevent people from dropping them.
Planet Fitness has benefited from the consolidation of the fitness industry during the pandemic, which has left the company with fewer budget-gym competitors.
Around 25% of US gyms and studios permanently closed during the pandemic – roughly 10,000 facilities, according to the industry trade group. Several major chains, including 24 Hour Fitness and Gold’s Gym, filed for bankruptcy.
Planet Fitness, however, did not permanently close any gyms during the pandemic. This was in large part due to its franchise gym model, with some of the gyms owned by private-equity groups.
The company has also capitalized on Americans looking to get in shape in the aftermath of the pandemic. Monthly visits to US gyms are higher than they were in 2019, according to Placer.ai, which tracks foot traffic to retailers.
Despite the rise of Peloton and the at-home workouts many people got used to during pandemic lockdowns, at-home exercise is not a threat to Planet Fitness’ $10 model.
“It’s a different customer,” Altobello said. “Not everyone has the money or the space to create an at-home gym.”

CNN Exclusive: US intelligence suggests Russia put off announcing Kherson retreat until after midterm elections
By Katie Bo Lillis, Zachary Cohen and Natasha Bertrand, CNN
Published 6:02 AM EST, Tue November 15, 2022
Russian President Vladimir Putin, left, and US President Joe Biden
CNN
 — 
The US has intelligence that Russia may have delayed announcing its withdrawal from the Ukrainian city of Kherson in part to avoid giving the Biden administration a political win ahead of the midterm elections, according to four people familiar with the intelligence.
Senior Russian officials discussed the US midterms as a factor during deliberations about the withdrawal announcement, one person familiar with the intelligence said. Waiting until after the US election was always a “pre-planned condition” of Russia’s withdrawal from Kherson, a second person familiar with the intelligence told CNN.
Still, the election was far from the only consideration in Russia’s retreat, officials said. Military analysts say Russia had few other operational options and had been preparing to pull back for weeks, leading US officials to wonder when the Russians would officially acknowledge the withdrawal.
CIA Director Bill Burns met with Russian counterpart Monday
While the intelligence is not a formal assessment of Russia’s intentions, it is a sign that Russia has a continued interest in influencing the US political landscape — although the sources said Russia probably miscalculated the impact such an announcement would actually have on the elections.
“I doubt Americans would really have noticed,” said another source familiar with western intelligence.
President Joe Biden last week appeared to hint that the US believed that the timing of Russia’s announcement was more than mere coincidence.
“I find it interesting they waited until after the election to make that judgement, which we knew for some time they were going to be doing, and it’s evidence of the fact that they have some real problems – the Russian military,” Biden said at a press conference last Wednesday.
Biden also said he hopes that with the elections over, the Russians will be more willing to negotiate the release of US citizens detained in Russia, including Brittney Griner and Paul Whelan. After the midterm elections, Griner’s attorney announced that the US basketball star would be moved to a Russian penal colony where she is due to serve the remainder of a nine-year drug smuggling sentence that was upheld in late October.
CIA Director Bill Burns was in Ankara on Monday discussing the American prisoners with his Russian counterpart, the National Security Council said, though the bulk of the discussion centered around managing the risk posed by nuclear weapons. The NSC declined to comment for this story.
The intelligence suggesting that Russia wanted to avoid giving the Democratic administration and Congress positive news on the eve of the elections adds to a growing body of evidence that Russia is betting that a Republican-led United States will offer less support to Ukraine.
House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy has hinted as much in recent interviews, telling CNN that a Republican House will more closely monitor and control the money and weapons flowing to Kyiv. Some Republicans say his public comments have been taken out of context and military support for Ukraine will remain high no matter who controls the House. Still, there remain vocal critics of US support for Ukraine in the GOP conference, including Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene and JD Vance, the incoming Republican senator from Ohio.
“Even though there is still robust bipartisan agreement on Ukraine, the party that has been much more vocally supportive is the Democratic Party, and particularly the Biden administration,” said one of the people familiar with the intelligence.
Russian mercenaries jockey for influence amid military struggles in Ukraine
Kremlin-linked oligarch Yevgeny Prigozhin appeared to confirm last week what the US intelligence community has known for years: that the Russian government sought to support Republican Donald Trump’s presidential campaign in the 2016 and 2020 elections because it deemed him friendlier to its interests.
“We interfered, we interfere and we will interfere” in US elections, Prigozhin, who runs the Internet Research Agency, a troll farm deployed during past US elections to spread disinformation, said on Telegram.
According to private researchers, suspected Russian operatives also used far-right media platforms to denigrate Democratic candidates in a handful of battleground states in the week leading up to this year’s midterm elections.
Still, multiple US and congressional officials who track Russian influence operations say that if Russia did choose to time its official withdrawal from Kherson to the US midterms, it likely overestimated how much Americans care about individual battles in Ukraine. That demonstrates a lack of sophistication in Russia’s information operations, these sources said.
“For all our hoopla about their information operations and political meddling, they’re still not that great at it in the grand scheme,” said the source familiar with western intelligence. “There is some really fundamental cultural misunderstanding there.”
Russian President Vladimir Putin himself did not announce the withdrawal — which Russia has termed a “maneuver” rather than a “retreat” — distancing himself from what has become a profound embarrassment for the Russian military. The withdrawal has been heavily criticized on Russian pro-war blogs.
“An announcement like this — no matter how Russia tries to spin it — it’s still clear that they’re giving up the only provincial capital that they seized during the invasion,” said one of the people familiar with the intelligence. “So it’s a ton of egg on their face.”

Global population hits 8 billion as growth poses more challenges for the planet
By Tara Subramaniam, CNN and Reuters
Updated 3:38 AM EST, Tue November 15, 2022

CNN
 — 
The world’s population will reach 8 billion people on Tuesday, representing a “milestone in human development” before birth rates start to slow, according to a projection from the United Nations.
In a statement, the UN said the figure meant 1 billion people had been added to the global population in just 12 years.
“This unprecedented growth is due to the gradual increase in human lifespan owing to improvements in public health, nutrition, personal hygiene and medicine. It is also the result of high and persistent levels of fertility in some countries,” the UN statement read.
Middle-income countries, mostly in Asia, accounted for most of the growth over the past decade, gaining some 700 million people since 2011. India added about 180 million people, and is set to surpass China as the world’s most populous nation next year.
But even while the global population reaches new highs, demographers note the growth rate has fallen steadily to less than 1% per year. This should keep the world from reaching 9 billion people until 2037. The UN projects the global population will peak at around 10.4 billion people in the 2080s and remain at that level until 2100.
Most of the 2.4 billion people to be added before the global population peaks will be born in sub-Saharan Africa, according to the UN, marking a shift away from China and India.

Environmental impact
Reaching an 8 billion global population “is an occasion to celebrate diversity and advancements while considering humanity’s shared responsibility for the planet,” UN Secretary General António Guterres said in the UN statement.
Having more people on Earth puts more pressure on nature, as people compete with wildlife for water, food and space. Meanwhile, rapid population growth combined with climate change is also likely to cause mass migration and conflict in coming decades, experts say.
And whether it’s food or water, batteries or gasoline, there will be less to go around as the global population grows. But how much they consume is equally important, suggesting policymakers can make a big difference by mandating a shift in consumption patterns.
Carbon emissions of the richest 1%, or about 63 million people, were more than double the emissions of the poorest half of humanity between 1990 and 2015, according to a 2020 analysis by the Stockholm Environment Institute and non-profit Oxfam International.
Resource pressure will be especially daunting in African nations, where populations are expected to boom, experts say. These are also among the countries most vulnerable to climate impacts, and most in need of climate finance.

 — 
The Taliban has ordered judges in Afghanistan to fully impose their interpretation of Sharia Law, including potential public executions, amputations and flogging, a move experts fear will lead to a further deterioration of human rights in the impoverished country.
Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid said Afghanistan’s Supreme Leader Alaiqadar Amirul Momineen made the “obligatory” command after meeting with judges to “investigate the cases of thieves, kidnappers, and seditionists.”
“Those cases that have met all the Shariah conditions of limitation and retribution, you are obliged to issue the limitation and retribution, because this is the order of the Sharia… and it is obligatory to act,” Mujahid tweeted Sunday.
Kaheld Abou El Fadl, a professor of Islamic Law at UCLA and one of the world’s leading authorities on Sharia law, told CNN there’s a rich history of debate on the laws of Sharia and various interpretations of their meaning.
“Every point of law you’ll find 10 different opinions … Sharia is very open-ended,” he said.
Sharia law within Islamic jurisprudence means the “search for the divine will,” El Fadl told CNN. “Although, both in Western and native discourses, it is common to use Sharia interchangeably with Islamic law, Sharia is a much broader and all encompassing concept, according to a statement from El Fadl’s website.
Women stopped from entering amusement parks in Kabul
The Taliban’s hardline implementation of the doctrine when the group was last in power from 1996 to 2001 included violent punishments, such as public executions, stoning, floggings and amputations.
El Fadl said that within the 1400-year tradition of Sharia, those punishments were rarely implemented because the majority of Islamic jurists throughout history didn’t interpret the law the way the Taliban currently does. “The Taliban have a particular approach to Sharia that one cannot ignore,” El Fadl said. “Anyone who doesn’t fit their definition can be possibly put to death.”
After seizing power last August, the Taliban attempted to project a more moderate image to gain international support, but in the months since, the group has clamped down on rights and freedoms.
Women in Afghanistan can no longer work in most sectors and require a male guardian for long-distance travel, while girls have been barred from returning to secondary school.
Last week, women were stopped from entering amusement parks in the capital Kabul after the Taliban’s morality ministry said women’s access to public parks would be restricted.
Taliban supreme leader warns foreigners not to interfere in Afghanistan
During the group’s first stint in power, the Taliban banned most forms of music as un-Islamic, and this August, in echoes of the policy, Afghan folk singer Fawad Andarabi was dragged from his home and killed.
Farhan Haq, deputy spokesman for the United Nations Secretary-General, told CNN the Taliban’s recent announcement regarding Sharia law was “worrying.”
“Since they took over as de facto authority, we expect them to abide by their promise to uphold existing human rights commitments made in Afghanistan,” Haq said. “They have not been living up to the commitments. We will continue to press them on this. We are opposed to death penalty in all its forms.”
The security situation in the country has also deteriorated since the group’s takeover last year, with the nation growing increasingly isolated and impoverished.
Nearly half of the country faces acute hunger, according to the United Nations. An estimated 43% of Afghanistan’s population is living on less than one meal a day, with 90% of Afghans surveyed reporting food as their primary need, according to a May report by the International Rescue Committee.

US lung cancer survival rate rises 21%, report says, but much work remains
By Jen Christensen, CNN

Preventable risk factors to limit cancer: Smoking, alcohol, high body mass index

CNN
 — 
The five-year lung cancer survival rate has increased 21%, from 21% in 2014 to 25% in 2018, making what experts call “remarkable progress” – but it is still the leading cause of cancer death in the United States.
However, in communities of color, a person’s odds of surviving five years after diagnosis are much lower, at only 20%, according to the 2022 State of Lung Cancer report, which was published by the American Lung Association on Tuesday.
The survival rate varies from state to state. Oklahoma has the lowest rate, at 19.7%, and Rhode Island has the highest, at 30.8%.
Cancer is the No. 2 cause of death in US. What you should know about screenings
“A 21% increase in five-year survival is good. I don’t think there are too many other groups that have seen that level of improvement,” said Dr. Jeffrey Crawford, a medical oncologist with Duke Health who was not involved in the new report.
The generally low survival rate is in large part because people often find out that they have the cancer only in later stages of the disease.
The odds of surviving cancer increase significantly when it is diagnosed early. About 44% of cases of lung cancer aren’t caught until a late stage, when the survival rate is only 7%, the report says.
More screening needed
In 2021, the US Preventive Services Task Force expanded its screening recommendations for lung cancer. It now urges screening for anyone ages 50 to 80 who has a “20 pack-year smoking history,” meaning they smoked one pack a day for 20 years or two packs a day for 10 years, they currently smoke or they have quit in the past 15 years.
In 2021, only about 5.8% of the recommended population was screened, the new report says.
Cancer mortality rates continue to decline amid 'major progress' in lung cancer early detection and treatment
“When lung cancer screening is implemented, cancers are caught earlier, when they’re more curable. There is a huge amount of progress to be made there,” said Dr. John Heymach, chair of thoracic/head and neck medical oncology at MD Anderson Cancer Center, who was not involved in the new research. “And 5.8% is actually an improvement from before, but those numbers are still dismally low.”
Some research suggests that as many as 60,000 lives could be saved each year if the 14.5 million Americans for whom it’s recommended get lung cancer screening.
Almost all private insurance plans cover the cost of screening. Most are required to do so under Obamacare. The only plans that are not required to cover these tests are through state Medicaid programs, but most states do so.
“It’s disappointing that the advances we are seeing are not due to massive success screening for lung cancer, which we should be doing. We’re still only screening a minority of patients,” Crawford said.
He said a part of the problem may lie at the primary care level.
“We’ve failed to get the primary care docs to change their attitudes about lung cancer because for decades, I think there’s been a kind of pessimism about lung cancer. They say it’s a smoker’s disease, and the outcomes are poor, or they think patients won’t be healthy enough to get surgery, so there’s no need to screen,” Crawford said. “There’s all sorts of misconceptions that just really aren’t true anymore, but I don’t think we’ve really gotten that message through as opposed to mammography for breast cancer. No one’s going to argue about that.”
Lung cancer inequities
People of color are much less likely to be diagnosed with lung cancer at an early stage, the report says.
Members of Black and Latino communities were 15% less likely to be diagnosed with lung cancer early than White people. Asian Americans were 16% less likely to be diagnosed early.
Latinos with lung cancer were 28% more likely than Whites to not receive any treatment. For Black people, it was 10%.
American Indians with lung cancer were 13% less likely to be diagnosed early, 21% less likely to get surgical treatment and 23% less likely to survive five years than people who are White.
Scientists find clues to how air pollution may trigger lung cancer
Nationally, the number of cases fell 11% from 2014 to 2018. Nearly 237,000 people will be diagnosed with lung cancer this year, the report says.
Cancer rates vary by state. Kentucky, for instance, has the worst lung cancer rate. It’s almost 2.3 times the incidence rate of Utah, which has the best rate. This is because of differences in things like available treatments, insurance coverage and risk factors.
It’s not only smokers who get lung cancer. Other risk factors include exposure to secondhand smoke, radon and air pollution.
About 137 million people live in parts of the US that have failing grades for unhealthy levels of air pollution, according to the 2022 American Lung Association State of the Air report
Why the state of lung cancer is improving
The new report does not explain why lung cancer numbers have declined over the years. One reason may be that fewer people smoke in the US than even 15 years ago, as the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has noted.
Rural cancer patients struggle with cost and distance to access promising cancer treatment
“Smoking cessation efforts in years and reductions in secondhand smoke due to policies in restaurants and other public places that restrict smoking have really been a fantastic success from a public health perspective and saved thousands of lives a year,” Heymach said.
Treatments have also gotten “dramatically better,” he said, with “dramatic strides” in survival.
Just a decade ago, for someone with cancer that has spread to other organs, the odds of surviving five years were less than 5%. The expected survival rate was about a year.
But with the discovery of targeted therapies known as EGFR inhibitors, pills that target specific mutations for lung cancer, the expected survival is now more than four years, Heymach said.
Those therapies apply only to the 40% to 50% of patients who have a mutation that can be targeted with a pill.
For others, immunotherapies like PD-1 inhibitors are used to stimulate the immune system to attack the cancer and improve the odds of five-year survival by more than 10%.

“That’s not as high as we like, but it’s still remarkable progress,” Heymach said. “All of these therapies really have made dramatic differences.”
He says there is a lot more to done to help people with lung cancer, but things are looking up.
“Of all the progress made in cancer survival in the last several years, a large percentage of that has been specifically in lung cancer. So lung cancer is the cancer type with the most dramatic advances in cancer therapies, and that’s certainly a welcome change, because for a long time, there was no progress.”

Suspect in UVA shooting was on the bus with victims returning from a Washington DC trip, school spokesperson says
By Amir Vera and Holly Yan, CNN
Updated 7:57 AM EST, Wed November 16, 2022
University of Virginia Athletic Director Carla Williams, left, and head football coach, Tony Elliott, speak to the media during a news conference November 15.
CNN
 — 
The suspected gunman in the University of Virginia shooting was on a class field trip with the victims before the shooting occurred, a UVA spokesman confirmed Tuesday.
Christopher Darnell Jones Jr., was on the bus returning from a trip to Washington, DC, where the class had seen a play, UVA spokesperson Brian Coy said.
Until Tuesday night, it was not known whether Jones was on the trip or if he was even on the bus prior to the shooting. Police are still trying to piece together what could have led to the deaths of three UVA football players.
Two other people, only one of whom has been identified, were also injured in the shooting. UVA Health spokesperson Eric Swensen gave CNN a status update on the two injured people Tuesday, saying one person was discharged and the other was in serious condition. Swensen did not identify either person.
Christopher Jones was arrested Monday in connection with the shooting.
Jones was arrested Monday morning and faces three charges of second-degree murder and three counts of using a handgun in the commission of a felony, UVA Police Chief Timothy Longo Sr. said. Since his arrest, Jones was transferred from Henrico County to the Albemarle-Charlottesville Regional Jail on Tuesday afternoon.
He is expected to appear in Albemarle General District Court Wednesday for a bond hearing, court records show.
The latest revelations come just hours after University of Virginia head coach Tony Elliott spoke publicly for the first time since the shooting, describing the last 24 hours as a nightmare.
“I’m ready for somebody to pinch me and wake me up and say this didn’t happen,” Elliott said, speaking publicly for the first time since three of his players were fatally shot late Sunday.
“Today was much better, we were able to transition from the pain to finding a little bit of joy in celebrating the lives of Lavel, D’Sean and Devin,” Elliott said.
The deaths of players Devin Chandler, Lavel Davis Jr. and D’Sean Perry left three enormous holes on a team that felt more like family than anything, the coach said. He went on to describe them, calling Chandler “the life of the party,” Davis “the big man on campus” and Perry “the quiet guy everyone wanted to know about.”

Despite such tragedy, Elliott commended the strength of his team and staff for coming together and being able to process the shooting. Elliott said the team has inspired him to keep pushing forward. At the same time, he said staff has made it their mission to ensure the team had all the resources they need and that no one went into isolation.
“The message to the team is we’re going to celebrate their lives going forward and the impact that they’ve made thus far and the legacy that they’re going to be a part of helping us establish going forward,” Elliott said.
It’s been apparent from both the news conference and the actions of the UVA and Charlottesville community over the last 24 hours that the team isn’t alone in their grief. Students, Cavalier fans nationwide and even rival teams have shown their support.
A memorial honoring Devin Chandler, Lavel Davis Jr. and D'Sean Perry features signs with the football players' jersey numbers.
A vigil Monday drew hundreds on the Charlottesville campus, with candles placed around the Statue of Homer along with signs reading “UVA Strong” and “1-15-41” – the uniform numbers of the three slain players.
“It was amazing, it was remarkable to see all those students supporting their classmates like that. It was healing, actually,” said UVA Athletics Director Carla Williams Tuesday.
As the team and community mourn, questions remain about the logistics of football and the university as a whole going forward. Classes at UVA are set to resume Wednesday, Mike Mather, managing editor for UVA Today, told CNN Tuesday afternoon.

The Cavaliers are also scheduled to play a game against Coastal Carolina on Saturday.
Williams said the athletics department – along with the football team and staff – will make the decision on whether to play on Saturday.
“We’ll use our best judgment, we’ll make a decision soon,” she said.
Elliott said the biggest questions surrounding the team right now are the wellbeing of the families of their deceased teammates and when players can interact with them. The biggest question from players, the coach said, has been “OK coach, how do we move forward?”
“The team is very self-aware that this situation is bigger than football,” he said.
Players had roles in the team dynamic, coach says
Tuesday’s news conference also saw Elliott drawing on old memories with his players.
The coach said Davis had a big smile and was the type to light up a room. The team reminisced over the last few days about intense debates about basketball in the locker room.
“The other thing that resonated was how good of a teammate he was,” Elliott said, adding that outside of the team, everyone knew him. “He always found a way to keep them (the team) entertained, but he also set that standard of what it’s supposed to look like to work.”
A gifted football player who was always trying to make people around him happy died in the UVA shooting. These are the victims
Chandler smiled all the time, and loved to dance and sing as well as compete. Teammates remembered how he wasn’t good at video games, but he just loved competing.
“The thing I remember about him was that he brought a smile to my face because he was comfortable with who he was,” Elliott said. “Devin was the life of the party, he kept everyone energized and found fun in grueling and monotonous work.”
Perry was the artistic one who liked drawing, shaping pots and listening to classical music, Elliott said.
“He had a sense of humor that was one of a kind. You knew immediately when someone said something that that was D’Sean,” Elliott said. “He was probably the most interesting man on the team.”
Along with the three players who passed, two other people were injured, one of whom was identified as Michael Hollins, a junior running back for the Cavaliers. Elliott said he was hard on Hollins because he saw his potential. The coach added that Hollins had a workman mentality in engaging the discipline and structure of the team, which led to improvements in his play.
“I think he’s a young man who’s fully invested in this institution, this program,” Elliott said. “He’s a guy I’ve seen come into his own as a leader.”
Hollins’ family told CNN that he was intubated.
The suspect ‘repeatedly refused to cooperate’ in a gun-related probe
Jones is listed on UVA’s athletics website as a football player in 2018 who, as a freshman, did not participate in any games. A UVA spokesperson told CNN Jones had a pre-existing injury that prevented him from playing on the football team in 2018.
Jones went through medical treatment and rehabilitation during his time with the team and was only a member of the team for one season, the spokesperson says.
“What I do know is the young man was a student beginning in 2018 and was a walk-on for one semester with our football program,” Williams, the athletic director, said Tuesday.
Jones was the subject of a pending case with the university’s judicial council when Sunday’s shooting unfolded, officials said.
What we know about the suspect in the deadly University of Virginia shooting
“On September 15, in the context of reviewing a potential hazing issue, UVA Student Affairs heard from a student that Mr. Jones made a comment to him about possessing a gun,” said Brian Coy, the university spokesperson.
That person “did not see Mr. Jones in possession of a gun,” and the “comment about owning a gun was not made in conjunction with a threat,” Coy said.
“In the course of their investigation, University officials spoke with Mr. Jones’ roommate, who gave no indication of the presence of any weapons. In the course of their investigation, University officials discovered that Mr. Jones previously had been tried and convicted of a misdemeanor concealed weapons violation in 2021, for which he received a 12-month suspended sentence and a small fine.”
Throughout the investigation, Coy said, “Mr. Jones repeatedly refused to cooperate with University officials who were seeking additional information about the claims that he had a firearm and about his failure to disclose the previous misdemeanor conviction.”
Watch out for 'leakage': These are some clues students can look out for to help prevent school violence
So on October 27, “the Threat Assessment Team escalated his case for disciplinary action,” Coy said.
The school’s judicial council took over the case, and the results are pending, the university’s police chief said.
Jones was also involved in a hazing investigation on campus that was closed because witnesses would not cooperate, said UVA Police Chief Timothy Longo Sr.
Correction: A previous version of this story incorrectly spelled the last name of UVA Health spokesperson Eric Swensen.

Police suspect ‘edged weapon’ was used in killings of 4 University of Idaho students. Here’s what we know
By Steve Almasy, Chris Boyette, Hannah Sarisohn and Eliott C. McLaughlin, CNN
Updated 1:45 PM EST, Tue November 15, 2022
Police are investigating the deaths of four University of Idaho students found in a house near campus Sunday.
KAYU
CNN
 — 
Police believe an “edged weapon” was used to kill four college students who were found in a house near the University of Idaho – deaths that sent shock waves through the campus of about 11,500 students.
“Investigators are continuing to work diligently on establishing a timeline of relevant events to re-create the victims’ activities on the evening of November 12 and early morning of November 13, following all leads and identifying persons of interest,” a police statement says.
Authorities did not provide many additional details, but the Moscow Police Department said in a statement that preliminary information leads investigators to “believe that an edged weapon such as a knife was used.” No weapons linked to the bodies – discovered Sunday after police responded to a report of an unconscious individual – have been found, police said.
Though no suspect is currently in custody, police believe this was “an isolated, targeted attack,” and there is no threat to the campus or surrounding community, they said.
Autopsies are scheduled to be completed later this week, and they should provide more information on the causes of death, the police statement says.
Classes were canceled Monday as officials worked to learn what happened at the home in the city of Moscow, located on the Washington-Idaho border, about 80 miles south of both Spokane, Washington, and Coeur d’Alene, Idaho.
“Words cannot adequately describe the light these students brought to this world or ease the depth of suffering we feel at their passing under these tragic circumstances,” school President Scott Green said in a statement.
Here’s what we know about the victims and the investigation:
The victims
The students were identified as:
Ethan Chapin, 20, of Conway, Washington, was a freshman majoring in recreation, sport and tourism management and a member of the Sigma Chi fraternity, according to the university.
Xana Kernodle, 20, of Avondale, Arizona, was a junior majoring in marketing and was a member of Pi Beta Phi sorority, the university said.
Madison Mogen, 21, of Coeur d’Alene, was a senior majoring in marketing and a member of the Pi Beta Phi sorority, the university said.
Kaylee Goncalves, 21, of Rathdrum, Idaho, was a senior majoring in general studies and a member of the Alpha Phi sorority, according to the university.
The investigation
Officers responded to a call about an unconscious person shortly before noon Sunday and discovered the four bodies, Moscow police said in a news release.
“All I can say is the deaths are ruled a homicide at this point, and homicide and murder are synonymous,” Moscow police Capt. Anthony Dahlinger told the Idaho Statesman. “We certainly have a crime here, so we are looking for a suspect.”
3 dead, 2 others wounded in University of Virginia shooting as police search for suspect
Dahlinger declined to characterize the deaths as violent, and Cathy Mabbutt, the Latah County coroner, told The New York Times the deaths were not a murder-suicide.
Anyone with information about the case is asked to call 208-882-COPS.
“The Moscow Police Department and the City of Moscow (are) deeply saddened for the families of these individuals, fellow students and friends, and our community during this time,” the police department said.
CNN has reached out to the university and to the police department for more details.
The community response
The students’ deaths are “senseless acts of violence,” Moscow Mayor Art Bettge said.
“This tragedy serves as a sobering reminder that senseless acts of violence can occur anywhere, at any time, and we are not immune from such events here in our community,” the mayor said. “Let us come together in support of each other, and be there for each other, as we mourn as a community.”
The university set up counseling resources for students and employees, Green, the school president, said in his statement. School officials are working with students to set up a candlelight vigil later this week.
“As Vandals, we come together and support one another through challenging times, leaning into our collective strength. Look out for one another now,” Green said.

Warren Buffett’s company buys $4 billion stake in Taiwanese chip giant TSMC
By Diksha Madhok, CNN Business
Updated 2:11 AM EST, Tue November 15, 2022
TSMC is so important to Taiwan that the maker of advanced semicomductors has been dubbed 'sacred mountain.'
New Delhi
CNN Business
 — 
Shares of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company surged on Tuesday after Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway disclosed that it had purchased a $4.1 billion stake in one of the world’s largest chipmakers.
In a filing with the United States’ Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday, Berkshire Hathaway (BRKA) said it acquired about 60 million American depository shares of TSMC (TSM) in the three months ended September.
Shares of TSMC were up over 8% in Taiwan on Tuesday.
“TSMC welcomes all investors with the propensity to buy and hold TSMC’s stock,” a spokesperson for the chipmaker said.
TSMC accounts for an estimated 90% of the world’s super-advanced computer chips, supplying tech giants including Apple (AAPL) and Qualcomm (QCOM).
Berkshire’s purchase of a stake in the Taiwanese chip giant comes as tensions between China and the self-governed democratic island are escalating.
Taiwan has been facing growing military aggression from Beijing in recent months, and that has thrown a spotlight on the critical role it plays in the global chipmaking industry.
Super-advanced semiconductor chips — like the ones produced by TSMC — are difficult to make because of the high cost of development and the level of knowledge required, meaning much of the production is concentrated in just a handful of suppliers.
The firm — widely dubbed in Taiwan as its “sacred mountain” — is so important to the island that its employees can apply to be exempted from military reservist training, the defense ministry has said.
Tensions between Washington and Beijing have also been rising lately over chips, with President Joe Biden imposing a sweeping set of controls on the sale of advanced chips and chip-making equipment to Chinese firms. Experts fear that these controls could shift the tech arms race between the United States and China to a whole new level.

Attorney calls for criminal investigation after video shows corrections officers beating Black man while in custody

Video shows corrections officers beating Black man in custody
02:45 - Source: CNN
CNN
 — 
An attorney for a North Carolina man is calling for a criminal investigation into why his client, a 41-year-old Black man, was beaten while in custody at the Camden County, Georgia, Detention Center in September.
In a news release, civil rights attorney Harry Daniels says his client Jarrett Hobbs was “mercilessly” beaten by officers at the detention center.
Video provided to CNN by Daniels shows Hobbs alone in a cell at the detention center. In the video five officers can be seen entering Hobbs’ cell, and one grabs Hobbs at his neck. During a struggle inside the cell, at least four of the officers can be seen wrestling with Hobbs, some of the officers hitting him in the head. A second video released by his attorneys shows Hobbs being pulled out of the cell and officers can be seen wrestling him to the ground. The video appears to show at least one officer kicking Hobbs. Four of the five officers appear to be White; the other appears to be Black.
Neither video provided by Daniels has audio, and it’s not clear what happened prior to what is seen on the videos.
“This video is undeniable and the deputies’ actions are inexcusable,” Daniels said in the release.
Daniels tells CNN there is a third video from a different angle, which includes audio of the altercation. Daniels said they are not releasing that video at this time, and though it does not show the altercation, you can hear the interaction between Hobbs and the officers.
In the release, Daniels said Hobbs was suffering a psychological episode at the jail and asked to be placed in protective custody.
In a statement, the Camden County Sheriff’s Office said, “Sheriff [Jim] Proctor has ordered an internal investigation of the incident to begin immediately. This investigation will include all recorded video from the time the inmate entered the facility on September 3rd, 2022 until his release on September 30th, 2022. If deemed necessary an additional agency will assist with the investigation.”
“Internal investigations involve reviewing of videos, questioning of witnesses, and documentation of evidence recovered which takes time, and not completed overnight,” the statement added. It did not release the names of the officers involved. CNN contacted the sheriff’s office for more details but did not receive a response.
The Georgia Bureau of Investigation also announced Tuesday it will conduct an “independent & thorough investigation” of the incident following a request from Brunswick Judicial Circuit District Attorney Keith Higgins, the agency said on Twitter.
“Once the investigation is complete, we will provide the file to the Brunswick Judicial Circuit District Attorney’s Office,” the GBI said.
Officers are seen in video from the Camden County Detention Center in Georgia.
Hobbs violated his probation on a federal case out of North Carolina by being in Georgia where he was charged with speeding, driving on a revoked or suspended license and possession of a controlled substance, Daniels said.
In North Carolina court documents on his probation revocation, his probation officer, F.J. Carney, who was not present at the Georgia detention center, gave a narrative of the events that happened at the Camden County jail.
“While Defendant was in custody at the CCSO complex in Woodbine, Georgia, jailers heard a large banging from Defendant’s holding cell. Defendant was reportedly kicking his cell door and was told by jailers to stop after already being warned to stop previously,” the court document said.
“Officer Carney testified that Defendant apparently continued this kicking, resulting in the jailers approaching him, giving him verbal commands and putting his hands behind his back. However, Defendant allegedly did not comply and responded to the jailers saying ‘I ain’t doing sh*t.’. After the jailers reportedly continued to give him orders and approached him, Defendant tensed up, pulled away, and a physical altercation between Defendant and jailers ensued,” the document continued.
“According to Officer Carney, Defendant resisted the jailers and subsequently punched one deputy in the face while punching another deputy in the side of his head. One deputy sustained a bruised eye and a broken hand as a result of the incident. Officer Carney did note that the report reflected that Defendant was struck in the head by one of the correctional officers, although Officer Carney is unaware of the exact sequence of events,” it said.
Daniels is calling on the district attorney to bring charges.
CNN has reached out to the District Attorney for comment on the case and has not heard back.
Hobbs is in custody in North Carolina, his attorney said. Some information in this report was provided by CNN contributor Bakari Sellers, who is also representing Hobbs in this case.

Global population hits 8 billion as growth poses more challenges for the planet
By Tara Subramaniam, CNN and Reuters
Updated 3:38 AM EST, Tue November 15, 2022
A market in Kolkata, India. The UN projects India will surpass China to become the world's most populous nation in 2023.
CNN
 — 
The world’s population will reach 8 billion people on Tuesday, representing a “milestone in human development” before birth rates start to slow, according to a projection from the United Nations.
In a statement, the UN said the figure meant 1 billion people had been added to the global population in just 12 years.
“This unprecedented growth is due to the gradual increase in human lifespan owing to improvements in public health, nutrition, personal hygiene and medicine. It is also the result of high and persistent levels of fertility in some countries,” the UN statement read.
Middle-income countries, mostly in Asia, accounted for most of the growth over the past decade, gaining some 700 million people since 2011. India added about 180 million people, and is set to surpass China as the world’s most populous nation next year.
But even while the global population reaches new highs, demographers note the growth rate has fallen steadily to less than 1% per year. This should keep the world from reaching 9 billion people until 2037. The UN projects the global population will peak at around 10.4 billion people in the 2080s and remain at that level until 2100.
Most of the 2.4 billion people to be added before the global population peaks will be born in sub-Saharan Africa, according to the UN, marking a shift away from China and India.
Nigera's most populated city, Lagos (pictured), is among African metropolises poised to become the globe's new megacities.
Environmental impact
Reaching an 8 billion global population “is an occasion to celebrate diversity and advancements while considering humanity’s shared responsibility for the planet,” UN Secretary General António Guterres said in the UN statement.
Having more people on Earth puts more pressure on nature, as people compete with wildlife for water, food and space. Meanwhile, rapid population growth combined with climate change is also likely to cause mass migration and conflict in coming decades, experts say.
And whether it’s food or water, batteries or gasoline, there will be less to go around as the global population grows. But how much they consume is equally important, suggesting policymakers can make a big difference by mandating a shift in consumption patterns.
Carbon emissions of the richest 1%, or about 63 million people, were more than double the emissions of the poorest half of humanity between 1990 and 2015, according to a 2020 analysis by the Stockholm Environment Institute and non-profit Oxfam International.
Resource pressure will be especially daunting in African nations, where populations are expected to boom, experts say. These are also among the countries most vulnerable to climate impacts, and most in need of climate finance.

Biggest rainforest nations form triple alliance to save jungle
Story by Reuters
Updated 10:46 PM EST, Mon November 14, 2022
Macaws sit on a tree in the Amazon rainforest in Brazil.
Bruno Kelly/Reuters
The world’s three largest rainforest nations Brazil, Democratic Republic of Congo and Indonesia on Monday formally launched a partnership to cooperate on forest preservation after a decade of on-off talks on a trilateral alliance.
Reuters reported in August that Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, elected as Brazil’s president at the end of October, would seek a partnership with the two other leading rainforest nations to pressure the rich world to finance forest conservation.
The rapid destruction of rainforests, which through their dense vegetation serve as carbon sinks, releases planet-warming carbon dioxide, imperiling global climate targets. Regrowing previously deforested jungle has the benefit of removing greenhouse gas already in the atmosphere.
Representatives of the three countries, which represent 52% of the world’s tropical rainforest, signed the joint statement at the talks in Indonesia ahead of the G20, or Group of 20 industrialised nations, which begins on Tuesday.
Indonesia, Brazil biggest culprits in tropical forest loss linked to industrial mining: study
“South-to-south cooperation – Brazil, Indonesia, DRC – is very natural,” the Democratic Republic of Congo’s Environment Minister Eve Bazaiba said prior to the signing.
“We have the same challenges, the same opportunity to be the solution to climate change.”
In the agreement, the alliance said that countries should be paid for reducing deforestation and maintaining forests as carbon sinks.
The countries will also work to negotiate “a new sustainable funding mechanism” to help developing countries preserve their biodiversity, as well as to increase funding through the United Nations’ REDD+ program for reducing deforestation.
The G20 talks coincide with the second and final week of the COP27 United Nations climate summit in Egypt, where Lula’s environmental adviser Izabella Teixeira said Brazil would seek to get the involvement of other countries in the Amazon basin, which spans nine nations.
“Forests matters, nature matters. And I do believe that without Amazon protection, we cannot have climate security,” said Teixeira, who was environment minister under Lula during his previous term as president that ended in 2010.
“I believe that Brazil should promote that other countries should come together.”
Talks on the alliance to protect rainforest until now had foundered due to “institutional difficulties,” Teixeira said.
The joint statement cited a meeting of the three countries at last year’s climate summit in Glasgow that injected momentum into the talks.
They have reached fruition in the final weeks of the right-wing presidency of Jair Bolsonaro before Lula takes office January 1.

Singer Roberta Flack can no longer sing after ALS diagnosis
Story by Reuters
Published 8:44 PM EST, Mon November 14, 2022
Roberta Flack at the 62nd Annual GRAMMY Awards on January 26, 2020 in Los Angeles, California.
Jon Kopaloff/FilmMagic/Getty Images/FILE
Grammy-winning musician Roberta Flack, whose hits include “Killing Me Softly with His Song,” has been diagnosed with ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease, and can no longer sing, her representatives said on Monday.
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a progressive disease, “has made it impossible to sing and not easy to speak,” a statement from her publicists said. “But it will take a lot more than ALS to silence this icon.”
A documentary about Flack’s life is set to debut at a film festival in New York next week. It will air on PBS television in the United States in January. Flack, 85, also is releasing a children’s book in January.
ALS breaks down nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord that make muscles work, leading to progressive paralysis and death.
Flack had several No. 1 hits in the 1970s and produced 20 studio albums. She won four Grammys and was honored with a lifetime achievement award in 2020.
The singer also was the first artist to win two consecutive record of the year trophies in 1973 for “First Time I Ever Saw Your Face” and in 1974 for “Killing Me Softly with His Song.”

CNN
 — 
“Dancing With the Stars” head judge Len Goodman announced he’ll be retiring from the show.
“This will be my last season judging ‘Dancing With the Stars,’” Goodman said during Monday’s episode of the ballroom dance competition. “I’ve been on the show since it started in 2005, and it has been a huge pleasure to be a part of such a wonderful show but I’ve decided I want to spend more time with my grandchildren and family back in Britain.”
Goodman received a standing ovation from the ballroom crowd, while fellow judges Carrie Ann Inaba, Bruno Tonioli and Derek Hough appeared moved to tears.
Before joining the show, Goodman, 78, was a judge on “Strictly Come Dancing,” a British version of “Dancing With the Stars.”
A former professional ballroom dancer himself, Goodman, who has seen more than 3000 performances in his 31 seasons on the show, concluded his announcement with a nod to his final night of judging set for next week.
“It’s been such a wonderful experience for me and I look forward so much to next week’s finale. I’m sure it’s going to be absolutely brilliant,” he said.
The Season 31 finale of “Dancing With the Stars” will air Monday, November 21 on Disney+.

Airlines forced to pay more than $600 million in refunds to passengers amid pandemic woes
By Geneva Sands and Pete Muntean, CNN
Published 6:33 PM EST, Mon November 14, 2022
A departures board lists multiple canceled flights in Terminal 1 at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York on Thursday, April 9, 2020.
CNN
 — 
Airlines have paid more than $600 million in refunds to hundreds of thousands of passengers for canceled or changed flights since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Department of Transportation announced Monday.
At the same time, federal regulators are cracking down on a half-dozen airlines they say skirted rules, which determine when refunds are issued. This all comes as airlines are struggling to keep up with a rapid rise in demand for air travel.
The department is also issuing $7.25 million in fines against the six airlines for the “extreme delays in providing those refunds to passengers,” Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said on a call with reporters.
That brings the total assessed fines for 2022 to $8.1 million – a record in civil penalties for the department’s consumer protection program.
Ultra low-cost carrier Frontier Airlines is the only US airline to face fines related to refunds. Foreign based carriers face the majority of fines: Air India, TAP Portugal, Aeromexico, El Al and Avianca.
“[T]he department’s expectation that when Americans buy a ticket on an airline, we expect to get to our destination safely reliably and affordably. And our job at DOT is to hold airlines accountable for these expectations, many of which are a matter of law and regulation,” Buttigieg said.
Last month, the Department of Transportation said of the 7,243 consumer complaints received about the airlines in August, almost one in every five concerned refunds.
The process of getting airlines to issue refunds varied by airline, according to Blane Workie, DOT assistant general counsel for the Office of Aviation Consumer Protection, who spoke on the call with Buttigieg.
For example, Frontier, changed its definition of “significant schedule change” in March 2020.
“In essence, they were retroactively applying a more stringent rule to consumers, and I can certainly say that Frontier would not have provided these refunds to tens of thousands of passengers if DOT had not been involved,” she said.
As part of the process, DOT required that Frontier provide the required refunds or inform all those passengers on how to obtain refunds in case they need to fill out forms.
Other airlines had extreme delays in providing refunds, Workie said.
Most of the refund complaints that the department has received have been against foreign air carriers, noted Workie.
Asked if this would serve as a deterrent to airlines, Buttigieg said, the “overall objective is to make sure passengers get their money back.”
“It shouldn’t take an enforcement action from the US Department of Transportation to get airlines to pay refunds that they’re required to pay. And so, I have asked the team to undertake an exercise to make sure that the fines are calibrated to deter this in the future and save passengers a lot of time and save everybody a lot,” he said.
Buttigieg later noted that the department will continue “ratcheting up the penalty side” until they see less of this kind of behavior.
All refunds have either been made or consumers should have been informed of the refund process, according to Workie.
However, the fines will be collected after DOT orders are issued on Monday.
There are more enforcement actions and investigations underway, according to Buttigieg, who said that “there may be more news to come by way of fines.”
However, Workie said there are no pending refund investigations against US airlines.
Buttigieg also noted the upcoming holiday travel season, saying that it is expected to be “among the busiest” since 2019, in terms of busy travel days.
He touted other actions taken by the department, including a new airline consumer service dashboard to help people see what they are owed when a flight is canceled or delayed because of an airline issue.

 — 
Sleeping in a room exposed to outdoor artificial light at night may increase the risk of developing diabetes, according to a study of nearly 100,000 Chinese adults.
Sleep deprivation affects nearly half of American adults, study finds
People who lived in areas of China with high light pollution at night were about 28% more likely to develop diabetes than people who lived in the least polluted areas, according to the study published Tuesday in the journal Diabetologia.
Ultimately, more than 9 million cases of diabetes in Chinese adults age 18 years and older may be due to outdoor light pollution at night, the authors said, adding the number is likely to increase as more people moved to cities.
However, a lack of darkness affects more than urban areas. Urban light pollution is so widespread that it can affect suburbs and forest parks that may be tens, even hundreds, of miles from the light source, the authors said.
“The study confirms prior research of the potential detrimental effects of light at night on metabolic function and risk for diabetes,” said Dr. Phyllis Zee, director of the Center for Circadian and Sleep Medicine at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago, who was not involved in the study
Health impact of light at night
Prior research has shown an association between artificial light at night and weight gain and obesity, disruptions in metabolic function, insulin secretion and the development of diabetes, and cardiovascular risk factors.
A TikTok trend about mouth taping while you sleep can be dangerous
A study published earlier this year by Zee and her team examined the role of light in sleep for healthy adults in their 20s. Sleeping for only one night with a dim light, such as a TV set with the sound off, raised the blood sugar and heart rate of the young people during the sleep lab experiment.
An elevated heart rate at night has been shown in prior studies to be a risk factor for future heart disease and early death, while higher blood sugar levels are a sign of insulin resistance, which can ultimately lead to type 2 diabetes.
“Healthy sleep is hugely important in preventing the development of diabetes,” said Dr. Gareth Nye, a senior lecturer of physiology at the University of Chester in the United Kingdom. He was not involved in the Diabetologia study.
“Studies have suggested that inconsistent sleep patterns have been linked to an increased risk of type 2 diabetes,” he said in a statement.
The new study used data from the 2010 China Noncommunicable Disease Surveillance Study, which asked representative samples of the Chinese population about social demographics, lifestyle factors and medical and family health histories. Blood samples were collected and compared with satellite imagery of light levels in the area of China in which each person lived.
What you should know about sleep loss and inflammation, according to new study
The analysis found chronic exposure to light pollution at night raised blood glucose levels and led to a higher risk of insulin resistance and diabetes.
Any direct link between diabetes and nighttime light pollution is still unclear, however, because living in an urban area is itself a known contributor to the development of diabetes, Nye explained.
“It has been known for a long time now that living in (an) urbanised area increases your risk of obesity through increased access to high fat and convenience food, less physical activity levels due to transport links and less social activities,” Nye wrote.
Ways to block the light
Strategies for reducing light levels at night include positioning your bed away from windows and using light-blocking window shades. If low levels of light persist, try a sleep mask to shelter your eyes.
Be aware of the type of light you have in your bedroom and ban any lights in the blue spectrum, such as those emitted by electronic devices like televisions, smartphones, tablets and laptops — blue light is the most stimulating type of light, Zee said.
Using melatonin for sleep is on the rise, study says, despite potential health harms
“If you have to have a light on for safety reasons change the color. You want to choose lights that have more reddish or brownish tones,” she said. If a night light is needed, keep it dim and at floor level, so that it’s more reflected rather than next to your eye at bed level, she suggested.
Avoid sleeping with the television on — if you tend to fall asleep while it’s still on, put it on a timer, Zee suggested.
Dim ambient lights in the evening at least two to three hours before bedtime, and if you “absolutely have to use computer or other light-emitting screens, change screen light wavelength to longer ones of orange-amber,” Zee said. “Importantly, get light during the day — daylight is healthy!”

48,000 University of California academic workers go on strike

 — 
About 48,000 academic employees across the University of California system walked off the job Monday morning, demanding higher pay and improved working conditions, according to the union representing them.
Striking workers include researchers, graduate student researchers and instructors, trainees, fellows, and others who provide academic support across the University of California’s 10 campuses. The United Auto Workers union represents these academic employee groups who want transportation subsidies and pay that matches housing costs.
Among the salary demands, the union wants a $70,000/year minimum salary for post-doctoral employees; their current salary range starts at $55,632/year.
A third railroad union rejects proposed contract, further raising the odds of a strike
The UAW, which has been negotiating since Spring 2021, alleges the University of California has taken unlawful actions such as bypassing the bargaining process and making unilateral decisions.
“People live in very cramped situations, people often face the prospect and reality of houselessness,” graduate student instructor Jack Davies told CNN affiliate KSBW.
The University of California said on its website that it “strongly disagree[s] with the UAW allegations that UC has engaged in unlawful behavior. Throughout the negotiations, UC has listened carefully to the union’s concerns and bargained in good faith, as illustrated by the many tentative agreements reached thus far including on topics underlying the UAW’s allegations.”
On Monday evening, the University of California proposed a third-party mediator for negotiations in the strike, saying in a statement that it is the “best path to an agreement.”
“We remain hopeful that with mediation and by maintaining a spirit of flexibility and compromise we can achieve a fair agreement with the UAW,” the system said.

MacKenzie Scott announces another $2 billion in donations
By Ramishah Maruf, CNN Business

Why philanthropies could flourish following Bezos, Gates divorces
03:01 - Source: CNN
New York
CNN Business
 — 
Billionaire philanthropist MacKenzie Scott has donated almost $2 billion to more than 300 organizations in the last seven months, she said in a Medium post Monday. This followed an announcement from her ex-husband and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos that he will donate the majority of his wealth during his lifetime.
Exclusive: Jeff Bezos says he will give most of his money to charity
Since her divorce from Bezos in 2019, Forbes estimates Scott has given away $14.4 billion to more than 1,500 organizations. Her most recent donation totals $1,990,800,000.
Scott made the announcement on the day Bezos, along with his current partner Lauren Sanchez, told CNN he plans to give away the majority of his $124 billion net worth during his lifetime. And though Bezos did not specify his donations, he said would devote most of his wealth toward combating climate change and unifying humanity.
Bezos had been criticized for not signing the Giving Pledge, a commitment for the world’s wealthiest to dedicate most of their wealth to charity.
A database of Scott’s donations will be posted “soon,” but the Medium post did list the charitable organizations that received aid, ranging from immigrant resources to school districts.
Girl Scouts of the USA receive largest ever donation from single donor
Though specific donation amounts weren’t published, some organizations already announced how much they had received from the philanthropist. Last month, Girl Scouts of the USA said it received its largest ever single individual donation from Scott, totaling $84.5 million.
Scott had gifted $436 million to Habitat for Humanity International and its affiliates in March to promote homeownership in Black and minority communities.
Scott noted many of the 343 organizations she donated to are funds, meaning they “pool donations and spread them across a diverse group of smaller organizations working toward a common cause.”
Big impact
Scott has been praised for challenging “big” philanthropy and her focus on LGBTQ and minority-focused organizations, even though others have given large, unrestricted gifts. But the scope and speed of her philanthropy has raised eyebrows. Additionally, a report from the Center for Effective Philanthropy that details Scott’s givings noted it has come with criticisms.
The large gifts may overwhelm organizations or lead to a misuse of funds, and her one-time gifts might cause other donors to pull back their support, critics say. Others have called for transparency for her selection methods.
But of the 277 nonprofit organizations surveyed, slightly more than half of the respondents said their grant from Scott has made fundraising easier, with some saying they are able to use it as leverage with other donors. And the large gift “has enabled organizations to focus funds where they were most needed to achieve their mission.”
Nonprofit leaders who had received grants from Scott said it was transformational for their organizations.
“The amount of money didn’t even feel real — what felt more real was the pride and validation that the work I was doing mattered, and somebody had noticed,” said one nonprofit leader whom the report did not identify. Eighty-eight percent of respondents said it was the largest unrestricted grant they ever received.

My son has been asking for a dress. I finally decided to just get him dresses despite being afraid he’d get teased by other kids. Today, the boy next door asked why he was wearing a dress, I said “he wanted one” and he said “okay” then they continued to play. The kids are alright

CNN
 — 
Comedian Dave Chappelle is making headlines for his “Saturday Night Live” monologue in which he joked, among other topics, about Kanye West’s recent antisemitic comments.
Chappelle’s barbs on the subject included tongue-in-cheek advice on how West should have handled the resulting firestorm, and a quip about the decision by sneaker manufacturer Adidas to drop the rapper as a business partner.

But comments he made about former President Donald Trump deserve even more attention than the ones about Ye. And they should serve as a wake-up call for anyone who thinks the former President is going to quietly fade away.
Chappelle pivoted about halfway through his 15-minute opening monologue to the topic of Trump, remarking that “I’m watching the news now, (and) they’re declaring the end of the Trump era.” He then melded his acerbic comedy with a simple truth that everyone wishing Trump would disappear from the political landscape needs to hear: Trump’s base hasn’t come close to abandoning him.
“I’m just being honest with you, I live in Ohio amongst the poor whites,” he said, adding, “A lot of you don’t understand why Trump was so popular (and) … very loved.” Chappelle — who acknowledged in his monologue that he’s a Democrat — then delivered a comedic explanation for why Trump is adored by his followers.
He joked that Trump was an “honest liar” who told the unvarnished truth about a system set up to help the rich and powerful. And he recounted how Trump openly admitted as much during a 2016 campaign debate: “He said, ‘I know the system is rigged because I use it.’ ”
The comedian then joked about how Trump, accused during that debate by Hillary Clinton of not paying taxes, shot back: “That makes me smart.”
Chappelle shared that for many working-class Americans struggling to makes end meet, Trump’s “honesty” in revealing that the rich and powerful have been taking full advantage of a system designed for their benefit only enhanced his stature.
The damage Kanye West is doing is devastating
Now, we can debate all day why people really “love” Trump. Was it for the reasons Chappelle suggested? Or was it that, for some, there is a perverse appeal in his bigotry and defense of white nationalists? Is it his “owning the libs”? His tax cuts that greatly favored the wealthy? It may be a mix of all those reasons — or entirely different ones. But there’s no disputing that in polls taken before last week’s election, Trump was far and away the top choice of Republicans to be their 2024 presidential nominee.
A New York Times/Siena College poll found in mid-October that 49% of Republican voters favored Trump as the party’s 2024 presidential nominee. His closest rival, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, got 26% support. That poll was taken before the GOP came up short in the midterms.
Since then, many in the party are blaming Trump for Republican candidates’ lackluster performance at the ballot box, noting that the high-profile candidates he endorsed lost key, marquee races. Trump’s most notable losses span the country, from US Senate candidates Mehmet Oz in Pennsylvania and Blake Masters in Arizona, to his choices for governor in battleground states such as Michigan and Wisconsin.
Stop obsessing over where trans kids use the bathroom
Still, there is no reason to believe that core Republican voters will be dissuaded from supporting Trump despite last week’s election debacle for which he has been roundly blamed. Trump was still the top 2024 choice of the GOP base despite his botched handling of the response to the Covid-19 pandemic (as polls in 2020 showed), and his role in riling up the crowds responsible for the January 6 attack on the Capitol.
If his base has overlooked all that, it’s hard to imagine that all his supporters will abandon him just because Republicans didn’t get the “red wave” they were expecting.
There’s another deeply concerning reason why Trump’s support will not simply evaporate. As historian and expert on autocracy Ruth Ben-Ghiat explained in a 2021 interview, Trump is an authoritarian leader who has developed a cult-like following. Trump has “followed the authoritarian playbook with propaganda, with corruption, with incitements to violence,” she said. This makes Trump’s bond with his supporters unlike anything we are accustomed to seeing in American politics.
And in an article she penned last year for The Economist, Ben-Ghiat said that Trump’s “influence will not dissipate until the institutions of democracy formally confirm misconduct, for example with a court conviction.” That is why in her view “it is so important to hold Mr. Trump accountable.”

But who knows if Trump will ever be “held accountable” and what the impact would be on his supporters if he ever were to be? Doing so may make his followers cling to him even more tightly — despite what millions of Americans, including even some Republican officeholders, may want.
Given reports that Trump is expected to announce his 2024 presidential run this week, I’d predict that he won’t be going away any time soon, even without having delivered the “red wave” his supporters had so fervently hoped for.

HOMEDESTINATIONSABU DHABI
Abu Dhabi
Abu Dhabi brings its own brand of culture and tradition to the UAE formula of sparkling waterfront, opulent architecture and desert distractions. A world away from the frenetic bright lights of neighboring Dubai, the capital of the Emirates has fostered a somewhat more genteel pace, pouring huge investment into its extravagant outpost of Paris's Louvre museum and the breathtaking Sheikh Zayed Mosque. There is excitement — the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix is an F1 fixture and theme parks like Ferrari World Abu Dhabi inject some adrenaline — but the best attractions are served at a slower pace: the oasis tranquility of second city Al Ain, the panoramas of Jebel Hafit mountain and the boundless desert dunes of the Rub al Khali Empty Quarter.

It’s the most happening of cities, a place where over 200 languages are spoken and millions flock each year to see its world-famous sights. New York draws visitors in like nowhere else. The crowded streets of Manhattan are the stuff of legend. First timers will want to head to the top of the Empire State Building and stand beneath the glare of the lights of Times Square. But there’s so much more to see and do, whether it’s catching an Off-Broadway play, checking out world class art at MoMA or shopping the streets of SoHo. Brooklyn’s hip neighborhoods of Greenpoint and Fort Greene offer a more relaxed vibe, while the food in Queens’ Chinatown is worth the long subway ride.

 — 
As the dust settles from one of the most shocking financial implosions in history, one of the key unknowns is how much customers who can’t access their money expect to get back from FTX, the crypto exchange that filed for bankruptcy last week.
The answer, according to legal experts, may be zero.
Before its unraveling, FTX.com marketed itself as a safe-for-beginners destination for buying and selling cryptocurrencies. But a liquidity crunch last week forced FTX to halt withdrawals, leaving customers and investors in limbo. FTX reportedly used customer funds to prop up its sister hedge fund’s high-risk trading operation without permission, according to the Wall Street Journal.
On Friday, FTX and the hedge fund, Alameda Research, filed for bankruptcy.
Federal prosecutors in New York are now investigating the exchange’s collapse, a person familiar with the matter told CNN. And authorities in the Bahamas, where FTX is based, launched a criminal probe into the firm over the weekend.
The week that took down a crypto behemoth
The legal ramifications for FTX and its founder, Sam Bankman-Fried, remain unclear. But as the exchange, once valued at more than $30 billlion, collapses, it looks increasingly likely that customers who handed their money over to FTX could be left holding the bag.
“We just don’t know the extent of contagion,” said Howard Fischer, a partner at law firm Moses Singer and a former Securities and Exchange Commission lawyer. “The first ring of victims are the people who had assets held in FTX…They are probably not going to be made whole, or anywhere close to it.”
There are a few reasons for this.
In a traditional US bank failure, the government insures customer deposits, making them whole up to $250,000. But there simply is no mechanism for depositor insurance in the largely unregulated world of cryptocurrencies.
In theory, FTX’s customers should get a cut of what’s left of the company’s assets at the end of the bankruptcy process. But so far, at least, it’s not clear how much will be left to disburse.
Beware: The companies that hold your crypto aren't insured the way banks are
“As far as I know, they have two assets — the goodwill value of the exchange and the value of their FTT coins,” said Eric Snyder, head of the bankruptcy department at the law firm Wilk Auslander. (Goodwill value refers to intangible assets like a brand’s reputation and intellectual property. And FTT coins, the crypto token issued by FTX, have lost more than 90% of their value over the past week.)
In bankruptcies, Snyder explains, there’s a fairly simple formula to figure out how much creditors — in this case, FTX depositors — will receive.
“The numerator is the assets, the denominator’s liability. You divide one into the other, and the [result] is what everybody gets,” he said. “But if people are pulling out all the assets, then there’s not going to be much of a numerator.”
He added: “It’s very conceivable that the return will be minimal at best.”
Of course, the suddenness of FTX’s downfall makes it a difficult case to assess this early on, lawyers say.
Normally, companies would have weeks to prepare bankruptcy filings that disclose, among other things, an explanation of why the company sought Chapter 11 protection and what it aims to accomplish in bankruptcy court.
Dan Besikof, a partner at Loeb & Loeb who specializes in bankruptcy, says it’s too soon to say whether customers are going to get any money back.
“All you can really do is guess from tweets where things stand,” he said. “And how customers recover their money might depend on a lot of different things, including which entity they hold the money through, what amount of the coins still remain.”
The FTX fallout has rattled the entire crypto industry, raising serious questions about the future of digital assets and the lack of global regulation.
On Monday, Changpeng Zhao, the CEO of FTX competitor Binance, sought to reassure his audience of the sector’s legitimacy.
“It’s obvious that people are jittery,” said Zhao, widely known as CZ, in a question-and-answer session on Twitter. “I want to say, short-term, it is painful. But I think this is actually good for the industry long-term.”
The giant crypto exchange briefly emerged as a lifeline for FTX before reversing course last week.
Zhao, whose tweet announcing Binance’s divestment in FTX helped fuel the smaller firm’s liquidity crisis, has denied having a “master plan” to expose FTX. Still, critics note the biggest, and perhaps only, winner in the downfall of FTX is none other than Zhao, now unquestionably the wealthiest and most influential player in digital asset trading.
“As much as some people blame me for whistleblowing or poking the bubble, I apologize for that … I apologize for any turmoil that I caused. But I think any time, if there’s a problem, the earlier we reveal it, the better.”
—CNN Business’ Matt Egan and Kara Scannell contributed to this article.
Correction: An earlier version of this article misstated the name of the law firm Loeb & Loeb.

Slower pace of rate increases could be coming ‘soon,’ says Fed vice chair

 — 
It could soon be time for the Federal Reserve to ease up on its super-sized rate interest hikes, according to the central bank’s number-two policymaker, Vice Chair Lael Brainard.
“I think it will probably be appropriate soon to maintain a slower pace of increases,” Brainard said Monday at an event hosted by Bloomberg News in Washington, DC.
The Fed has taken the unprecedented step of issuing a series of massive rate hikes in its battle to tame decades-high inflation. At each of its past four meetings, the central bank approved a rate hike of three-quarters of a percentage point, raising its benchmark lending rate by 4 percentage points in just nine months.
Those efforts are having an effect on the economy, and while there remains additional work to do to bring inflation down to the Fed’s preferred target of 2%, it may be appropriate to take a more “deliberate” approach and review how monetary tightening is flowing through the economy, Brainard said.
“You can see that in financial conditions, you can see it in inflation expectations, which are quite well anchored, you can see it in interest rate-sensitive sectors,” she said, adding that lags in the data mean that it’s going to take some time for the cumulative tightening to take effect.
“It makes sense to move through a more deliberate and data-dependent pace as we continue to make sure that there’s restraint that will bring inflation down over time,” she added.
The Fed is keeping a close eye on the effects of its efforts, Brainard assured. While the main goal of tighter monetary policy is to bring demand into better alignment with supply, there are expectations that it could ultimately lead to higher unemployment.
Noting a “highly unusual labor market” thrown into upheaval due to the global pandemic, there remains a considerably high ratio of openings to unemployed workers. The Fed is hopeful that some demand can be filled by those high vacancies, instead of just layoffs, she said.
“It’s likely there will be a combination of both,” she said. “We’ll be watching the labor market as well as inflation very carefully as we go forward.”
How does inflation affect my standard of living?
Brainard’s remarks come a day after Fed governor Christopher Waller indicated that future rate hikes might come in 50-basis-point increments — half a percentage point — starting with the Fed’s December meeting.
Waller, speaking at a conference in Sydney, said there was evidence that inflation was moderating, but urged caution about overreacting to one data point, according to reports.
Last week, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that annual inflation had slowed to 7.7% in October, the lowest reading since January. Investors were exuberant at finally receiving some good news on inflation, sending stocks to their best day since 2020.
But inflation will have to make a continued run lower “before we really start thinking about taking our foot off the brakes here,” Waller said, according to Bloomberg.
“We’ve got a long, long way to go to get inflation down,” he said. “Rates are going to keep going up and they are going to stay high for a while until we see this inflation get down closer to our target.”

How an ‘electronic nose’ could help fight wildfires

German startup Dryad has designed a cheap sensor that could drastically reduce detection time for wildfires.

In the summer of 2021, wildfires caused a “disaster without precedence” in the Italian island of Sardinia, burning over 28,000 hectares (69,000 acres) of land and displacing thousands from their homes.
Almost half of the affected land burned in a single catastrophic fire that affected the Montiferru region, near the island’s western coast. Now, Montiferru is one of a dozen forest areas across the world that are testing out a new “ultra-early” warning system for wildfires, developed by a German startup called Dryad — after the nymphs of Greek mythology that live in symbiosis with trees.
Preventing even a fraction of wildfires from developing would have sweeping benefits. Climate change is making wildfires more intense, and the number of extreme wildfire events is projected to increase up to 14% by 2030.
Apart from the billions of dollars of damage they cause, the particles and chemicals they produce are strong pollutants and in 2021, wildfires released a record 1.76 billion metric tons of carbon in the atmosphere — equivalent to more than double Germany’s yearly CO2 emissions.
Existing early warning systems are based on visual detection of smoke, either through satellite imaging, cameras on the ground or human observers. But these systems are too slow, according to Dryad’s co-founder and CEO, Carsten Brinkschulte.
“In order to generate smoke that rises above the tree canopy and can be seen from a distance of, say, 10 to 20 miles, the underlying fire has to be substantially big — you might already have half a football pitch on fire underneath. Then, if you add the time for firefighters to arrive at the scene, it may have become too big to be extinguished at all.”
An electronic nose
Dryad, which has raised €13.9 million (about $12.2 million), aims to reduce the detection time of wildfires and catch them at the smoldering phase — when there is not yet an open flame —usually within the first 60 minutes.
To do so, the company has designed a solar-powered sensor fitted with a gas detector. “It can detect hydrogen, carbon monoxide and volatile organic compounds — it can basically smell the fire,” says Brinkschulte. “Think of it like an electronic nose that you attach to a tree.”
This company is making whirlpools to clean microplastics from water
Once the sensor detects a fire, it sends out a signal over a wireless network using a built-in antenna. The signal is then relayed to more complex devices and transmitted to the internet by satellite and 4G. Finally, the information is sent to the forest managers.
“We also send out an alert and we can interface directly with the local fire brigade’s IT systems. What you get is an alarm with the exact GPS coordinates of the sensor that picked up the fire,” says Brinkschulte.
Baptism of fire
The sensors sell for €48 ($49) each. Dryad, which has a team of about 30, sells the hardware and also offers an annual subscription model — priced at 15% of the total hardware cost — that includes maintenance and support. Its main clients are municipalities and private forests, as well as electricity companies and railroads, whose equipment is often the source of fires.
Placed at the edge of the forest, these gateway sensors transmit the emergency signals to the internet over satellite and 4G.
Dryad
So far, the startup has installed 300 sensors across a dozen test deployments in Germany, Greece, Spain, Portugal, Turkey, the United States and South Korea, as well as Montiferru in Italy. Brinkschulte says that these trial runs only require a handful of sensors because the fires are started intentionally, to show forest managers how the system works.
“We have been testing the Dryad system in a forest area of around 50 hectares (124 acres), which was particularly badly affected by arson,” says Philipp Nahrstedt, who manages a forest of 62,000 hectares in the central-eastern German state of Saxony-Anhalt.
“We set a forest fire and within 14 minutes it was detected by the sensors. This detection time was phenomenal and showed how much potential the Dryad system has,” he adds.
Dryad is now looking to ramp up production of the sensors, with a plan to make 10,000 units in the coming months and 230,000 next year.
“We’ll go into the millions over time,” says Brinkschulte, adding that Dryad’s goal is to have 120 million of them deployed by 2030. That, he says, would be able to save 3.9 million hectares of forest from burning — about 40% of the land area burned globally by wildfires in 2021 — and prevent 1.7 billion metric tons of CO2 from reaching the atmosphere.

Jennifer Siebel Newsom, wife of California Gov. Gavin Newsom, testifies that Harvey Weinstein raped her

 — 
Jennifer Siebel Newsom, a filmmaker and the wife of California Gov. Gavin Newsom, took the stand in Harvey Weinstein’s sexual assault trial in Los Angeles on Monday, at times breaking into tears while alleging he raped her in a hotel room in 2005.
Weinstein has pleaded not guilty to multiple sexual assault charges, including four counts of rape, four counts of forcible oral copulation, sexual penetration by force and sexual battery by restraint in incidents dating from 2004 to 2013.
Siebel Newsom was being cross-examined by the defense team when the judge halted proceedings for the day. She will resume her testimony Tuesday morning.
Earlier, Siebel Newsom, the fourth accuser to testify, said she was “a little nervous,” and grew emotional shortly after taking the stand.
Asked by prosecutor Marlene Martinez whether she could see Weinstein in court Monday, Siebel Newsom began to cry and said “yes” into the microphone in a shaky voice.
“He’s wearing a suit, and a blue tie and he’s staring at me,” she said.
These are the women expected to testify against Harvey Weinstein at his second sexual assault trial
She told the court she met the media mogul when she was 31 years old in 2005 while at a bar with other industry friends during the Toronto Film Festival. “There was this big person coming towards me and it felt like everybody sort of backed away,” she recalled, saying, “It felt like the Red Sea was parting.”
He then introduced himself to her and asked her to meet with him later to continue their talk because he had a meeting, she testified.
“I felt like I had to go meet with him … maybe he’ll give me good advice.. I thought that there was a genuine interest in talking to me about my work,” she said, adding she and a friend met with Weinstein at a different hotel bar.
Weinstein “was really focused on telling me I was special,” Siebel Newsom told the court, adding Weinstein told her he wished he could stay and talk some more, but had to catch a flight to New York.
Meeting was at an LA hotel, where Weinstein assaulted and raped her, Siebel Newsom tells court
She said Weinstein then contacted her at the end of September 2005 when he was in Los Angeles, and she was living in the West Hollywood neighborhood. He dropped by a party she was having for five minutes and, according to Siebel Newsom, said: “I’ll be in touch, I’d like to have a meal with you or a drink or something and continue the conversation. We can talk about your film projects.”
He called and invited her to a hotel where an assistant told her the meeting would be in Weinstein’s suite, she testified. After she arrived, either Weinstein or an assistant told everyone in the room to leave, she told the court.
She described Weinstein as uninterested in hearing about her projects. “He abruptly got up and said I’m going to go get more comfortable,” she said.
According to her testimony, Weinstein was down a hallway, bent over while wearing a robe. “Can you help me?” she says he asked.
“Then I saw that he was touching himself, and he grabbed me,” she told the jury as she began to cry.
He was aggressive and she tried to back away, she said.
Weinstein softened his approach, she testified, but eventually he carried or dragged her to the bedroom and raped her.
When asked by a prosecutor why she remained in the hotel suite, she said, “Because you don’t say no to Harvey Weinstein. He could make or ruin your career. I thought I was going to discuss my projects.”
Siebel Newsom said she didn’t tell anyone that night nor did she call police about the incident.
“I was so violated and I don’t know how that happened,” she said through tears. “I didn’t see the clues and I didn’t know how to escape.”
Defense asks about campaign contributions to husband
Defense attorney Mark Werksman said in his opening statement October 24 that Siebel Newsom had consensual sex with Weinstein because she wanted his help getting roles and producing films.
He took particular aim at her, attacking her credibility using crude language.
“She’s made herself a prominent victim in the #MeToo movement … otherwise she’d be just another bimbo who slept with Harvey Weinstein to get ahead in Hollywood,” Werksman said.
On Monday, he spent some time focused on whether the governor – who Siebel Newsom married in 2008 – knew of the alleged rape at the time he accepted a campaign contributions from Weinstein. Siebel Newsom said she asked the campaign staff to ask Weinstein for money but Newsom returned the funds “right away” in October 2017 after figuring out something happened.
“I told him that Harvey was sketchy at different times, and he picked up on it himself when he met him,” she testified.
Weinstein is charged with forcible oral copulation and forcible rape of Jane Doe 4 between September 1, 2004 and September 30, 2005, according to court documents. Jane Doe 4 has been identified as Siebel Newsom.
Siebel Newsom is a Stanford University graduate who has written, directed and produced several documentaries, including “Miss Representation,” “The Mask You Live In” and “The Great American Lie.” During her time as California’s first partner, Siebel Newsom has advocated for working mothers and launched initiatives focused on closing the gender pay gap, among other efforts.
The trial in California is his second such sexual assault case since reporting by The New York Times and The New Yorker in 2017 revealed Weinstein’s alleged history of sexual abuse, harassment and secret settlements as he used his influence as a Hollywood power broker to take advantage of young women.
Weinstein was found guilty in 2020 in New York of first-degree criminal sexual act and third-degree rape and was sentenced to 23 years in prison. He has maintained his innocence, and New York’s highest court agreed in August to hear his appeal in the case.

Xi and Biden cool the heat, but China and the US are still on collision course

 — 
The world can breathe a little easier after US President Joe Biden’s talks with Chinese leader Xi Jinping on Monday.
But the two 21st century superpowers are still on a collision course.
The summit in Indonesia yielded two important outcomes, according to the US: A joint position that Russia must not use a nuclear weapon in Ukraine and an expected resumption of talks on climate between American and Chinese negotiators, a boost for the COP 27 global climate conference in Egypt.
Biden, meanwhile, reported that he stressed to Xi that Beijing also has an obligation to temper North Korea’s destabilizing missile and nuclear activity that has the Pacific region on edge.
That the world’s two most powerful leaders had not been addressing these issues together in recent months shows how the entire world suffers when Washington and Beijing are as deeply estranged as they’ve been this year.
Public statements from both sides also appeared to indicate a basic foundation that each recognize the critical nature of their rivalry, and both want to ensure that it doesn’t boil over into a war, at least yet. They are moving towards reopening more regular conversations — US Secretary of State Antony Blinken is now expected to visit China next year. Such exchanges have been suspended since House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan in August and triggered fierce Chinese protests and a vast military operation showing a growing capacity to cut off the self-governing island.
Communications between leaders are critical at times of crisis – and any understanding and trust between Xi and Biden could come into play in the event, for instance, that the two sides’ naval forces slide into a clash in the South China Sea. Biden has known Xi for years and having a channel to the top in Beijing is especially vital now that his counterpart has become synonymous with the Chinese state itself, as “Xi Jinping thought” becomes official doctrine. The lack of such communications between leaders is one reason why the Russian standoff with the West over Ukraine is so perilous.
Leon Panetta – a former White House chief of staff, defense secretary and CIA chief who dealt with US-China relations for decades – expressed cautious optimism after the talks on the sidelines of the G20 summit.
“If the result of this meeting is to put the relationship back on a more diplomatic plane, in which instead of beating each other up they can begin a dialogue on the kind of issues that need to be dealt with, I think this meeting could very well be pivotal,” Panetta told CNN’s John King on “Inside Politics.”
Limits of leader summits
Relationships between leaders can set the tone for inter-state contacts. But they are also often overrated by the leaders themselves and in post-summit analysis. The dynamics that have led to the US and China each viewing the other as their prime national security threat are being driven by national interests not personality, even if Xi’s assumption of ultimate power in Beijing with a norm-busting third term may mean he may now have less of an immediate political reason to demonstrate toughness toward the United States.
But at the summit in Bali, Indonesia, it was clear that while both sides want to avoid a clash now, their goals – China wants to be the preeminent Asian and potentially global power, as does the US – remain fundamentally incompatible.
While Biden said he now understands that China has no imminent plan to invade Taiwan, he did rebuke Xi over Beijing’s “coercive and increasingly aggressive actions toward” the island, according to the White House. China’s readout of the talks expressed irritation with a central premise of Biden’s foreign policy – the global clash between democracy and autocracy, and the fact that relations with Beijing tend to be viewed by this prism.
“Neither side should try to remold the other in one’s own image or seek to change or even subvert the other’s system,” the Chinese Foreign Ministry said.
“Instead of talking in one way and acting in another, the United States needs to honor its commitments with concrete action,” the readout added.
Equally, Xi’s public comments before the talks that “a statesman should think about and know where to lead his country. He should also think about and know how to get along with other countries and the wider world,” could be seen as an acknowledgment of new responsibility with China now a major world power. But they could also be read as the kind of lecture that Washington once delivered to Chinese leaders that Xi is now taking the opportunity to throw back at the US.
Biden said after the talks that he didn’t find Xi “more confrontational or more conciliatory. I found him the way he’s always been: Direct and straightforward. … We were very blunt with one another about places where we disagreed or where we were uncertain of each other’s position.”
Such commentary suggests heated behind-closed-doors disagreements on the most volatile areas in the relationship – Taiwan, trade and human rights, for example. But at least, after adding a measure of strategic confusion to the US position on Taiwan with his own recent comments that suggested Washington would come to the island’s defense in the event of a Chinese invasion, Biden said he and Xi now understood exactly where one another were coming from.
Progress for the world
But there were some signs that the world’s most powerful nations can still work together in the planet’s wider interests.
Biden publicly told Xi that the US was ready to reengage in climate talks – at an opportune moment for the Egypt climate summit. After the talks, a White House readout said that the two leaders “agreed to empower key senior officials to maintain communication and deepen constructive efforts” on climate change, global macroeconomic stability including debt relief, health security and global food security.”
The US statement that Xi and Biden “reiterated their agreement that a nuclear war should never be fought and can never be won and underscored their opposition to the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons in Ukraine” was also important.
While Beijing has yet to confirm Xi’s side of the conversation, China’s consummation of a new friendship with Moscow just before the invasion of Ukraine caused alarm in the West. And as top US and Russian officials met in Turkey on Monday, partly about the nuclear issue, the signals coming out of the Xi-Biden talks could be an important indication of restraint from Beijing to Moscow and a diplomatic win for Washington.
Biden’s maneuvering is also the latest sign that an emerging goal of his foreign policy is to stress differences between Moscow and Beijing. Before he went to Asia, Biden suggested that China didn’t have that much respect for either Russian President Vladimir Putin or Russia itself.
So, Washington’s foreign policy has come full circle, since part of Richard Nixon’s motivation in engaging China during the 1970s Cold War deep freeze was to open strategic gaps between Beijing and Moscow.
Things aren’t so different now, though the dynamic between the Kremlin and Beijing has reversed, with China the global power and Russia the junior partner.

Michelle Obama on Donald Trump’s 2016 win: ‘It shook me profoundly’

 — 
Michelle Obama addressed in a new book the deep hurt and disappointment she felt when Donald Trump won the 2016 presidential election.
“It shook me profoundly to hear the man who replaced my husband as president openly and unapologetically using ethnic slurs, making selfishness and hate somehow acceptable, refusing to condemn white supremacists or to support people demonstrating for racial justice,” wrote Obama in “The Light We Carry,” a copy of which was obtained by CNN. “It shocked me to hear him speaking about differentness as if it were a threat.”
Audio excerpts from the book were first released Monday to NPR.
Obama wrote that she and Barack Obama had built their principles on “hope and hard work,” and that she was confounded when the country chose to elect Trump.
Michelle Obama praises Biden but stops short of full-throated 2024 endorsement
“For eight years, we tried to live those principles out loud, recognizing that we made it as far as we had despite and maybe even in defiance of the bigotry and bias so deeply embedded in American life,” said Michelle Obama. “We understood that our presence as Black people in the White House said something about what was possible. So we doubled-down on our hope and hard work, trying to inhabit that possibility.”
“Whether or not the 2016 election was a direct rebuke of all that, it did hurt. It still hurts,” she said. “It felt like something more, something much uglier than a simple political defeat.”
“Stuck in my house, over the frightening months of early 2020, I saw no logic to any of it,” Obama said, analyzing how she sunk into a deep lack of hope. “What I saw was a president whose lack of integrity was reflected in an escalating national death count, and whose poll numbers were still decent.”
Obama also said how she was scared when Barack Obama first brought up to her that he wanted to run for president.
“I found the prospect of it actually terrifying,” she said, describing how she took time to come to terms with the decision. “I could have altered the course of history because of my fear. Instead I said ‘yes.’”
Obama’s new book, which goes on sale Tuesday, is a guide and reflection on how she coped with the last few years, how she overcame despair and anxiety, and rebuilt hope in the future. Her first memoir, “Becoming,” was released in 2018, selling more than 17 million copies worldwide, making it one of the top-selling books of all time.

 — 
Christina Applegate celebrated receiving a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on Monday.
The event marked Applegate’s first public appearance since she shared her multiple sclerosis diagnosis last year. The actress reflected on her career in a moving speech that was filled with heart and humor.
“I’ve had a really interesting life,” Applegate said. “The life started as being a little girl, waiting in line to see the first ‘Star Wars’ on this very street, at that very theater, looking at these [stars on the street] going, ‘who are these people?’ What did they do? Did they do something right? Did they do something wrong? Whatever it is, I want one. I f-ing want one! And I was five years old. So this day means more to me than you can possibly imagine.”
Applegate was honored at the event by several current and former colleagues, including her “Married…With Children” TV family Katey Sagal and David Faustino, and her “Dead To Me” co-star Linda Cardellini.
“You are my everything. I love that I started with you two,” she said, referring to Faustino and Sagal, who stood by her side as she spoke. “I thank you so much from the bottom of my heart. You are my people. You are my loves.”
In a recent interview with the New York Times, Applegate spoke about the effort it took for her to finish filming the third and final season of “Dead to Me,” which debuts on Netflix later this week.
“If people hate it, if people love it, if all they can concentrate on is, ‘Ooh, look at the cripple,’ that’s not up to me,” she told the publication. “I’m sure that people are going to be, like, ‘I can’t get past it.’”
“Fine, don’t get past it, then,” she added. “But hopefully people can get past it and just enjoy the ride and say goodbye to these two girls.”
Applegate shed tears when she addressed her daughter in the crowd at Monday’s ceremony.
“Thank you for standing beside me through all of this,” Applegate said, before quipping to the audience, “Oh, by the way, I have a disease. Did you not notice? I’m not even wearing shoes…You’re supposed to laugh at that!”

Banksy confirms seven new murals in Ukraine

Three days after Banksy debuted his latest mural on Instagram, spray painted on the wall of a bombed building in the city of Borodianka, Ukraine, the anonymous street artist confirmed that he completed seven new works in Ukraine in total.
Banksy confirmed the news to The Art Newspaper after a series of murals suspected to be his appeared in the liberated Ukrainian city, which is located about 35 miles northwest of Kyiv. Other works are located in the capital and other cities in the region.

The first artwork to be identified, which went viral over the weekend, shows a female gymnast balancing on a pile of rubble on the side of a building damaged by Russian strikes.
The graffiti artist posted three images of the piece Friday on social media, with a simple caption reading ""Borodyanka, Ukraine"" — an alternative spelling for the town's name.

Another artwork depicts a little boy, wearing a martial arts uniform tied with a black belt, flipping a grown man onto his back. Some have connected the image to Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose honorary black belt was revoked earlier this year by World Taekwondo, though Banksy has not publicly commented on the image or its meaning.
Other murals showed two children using a metal tank trap as a seesaw, and a woman in hair curlers and a gas mask holding a fire extinguisher.

Borodianka was hit particularly hard by Russian airstrikes and shelling in the early days of the country's invasion of Ukraine, with many buildings reduced to piles of rubble by long-range attacks. It was home to 13,000 people before the war, but most fled after Russia's invasion. What was left of the city was then occupied by Russian forces, who moved in on February 28.

The town came back into Ukrainian control on April 1, and returning residents found their houses ransacked and shops pillaged with windows broken and contents stolen. It has since been the focus of reconstruction efforts, with several tower blocks demolished as a result of damage caused by the fighting.
The series is the first set of Banksy artworks to pop up since last summer's ""Great British Spraycation,"" which saw the enigmatic artist leave behind his signature pop art commentary at sites across a number of British coastal towns.
Internet speculation grew before the artworks were confirmed. Credit: Ed Ram/Getty Images
Last year, the artist also focused his efforts on raising money for social and political causes, auctioning a painting for a record-breaking $23.1 million for UK healthcare organizations, and selling t-shirts in support of anti-racist protestors arrested for toppling a statue of slave trader Edward Colston in Bristol. (The protesters were cleared of charges in January.)
After confirming his authorship of the gymnast mural, many Ukrainians and supporters of the country in the face of its invasion thanked the artist in social media comments and posts.
Why this Chinese artist is outselling Van Gogh
""This is such a historic moment for our country, that people like Banksy and other famous figures are coming here and showing the world what Russia has done to us,"" a Kyiv resident told Al Jazeera English in a video posted to Twitter on Sunday.
CNN's Teele Rabane contributed to this report.

How a NASA scientist and a record-breaking mountaineer conquered an unknown mountain to raise money for girls’ education

 — 
Exploring the peaks of the world’s highest mountains or the secrets of space’s deepest labyrinths has become almost second nature for Poorna Malavath and Kavya Manyapu.
It has taken Manyapu to NASA where her research has included designing space suits, and Malavath to the top of Mount Everest when in 2014, she became the youngest ever woman to summit the world’s highest mountain at just 13 years old.
Now, these two women have channeled their exploring spirit into climbing some of the world’s most difficult mountains as part of their campaign, Project Shakthi, which raises money to fund girls’ education.
At the end of August, they climbed a 6,012m virgin peak in Ladakh, India – one previously unmapped and untouched by human expeditions – aiming to use the symbolism of blazing a trail both literally and metaphorically.
Never climbed before, the mountain presented difficult challenges for even an experienced mountaineer like Malavath, for there were neither trails to follow nor advice from previous climbers to cling to.
“We have to prepare ourselves mentally to accept everything,” Malavath explains to CNN Sport. “So it is completely different and it has given me so much more knowledge to guide others.”
Every member of the team experienced some form of altitude sickness ascending the virgin peak, given the altitude at which they were climbing.
Project Shakthi Team
Rainy weather conditions that turned to snow at high altitude added to the complexities of climbing a virgin peak.
“The night when we were planning to leave for our summit bit, it actually snowed at our high camp, which meant avalanche conditions on the mountain we wanted to climb that day,” Manyapu recalls to CNN.
“We had to rapidly come back as a team, make a safety call and then prepare for the next day. So it was very challenging.”
And for a relatively inexperienced climber like Manyapu, though she had trained extensively, the challenges were even greater.
“Poorna and I several times when we were in the tent, we would talk about: ‘What if, you know, we won’t be able to make it to the summit, you know, what if this? What if that?’” Manyapu says.
“But then we would always like go back and encourage each other and motivate each other that, you know, let’s just take it one step at a time.”
‘I’ve always been inspired by her story’
In the group’s darkest moments on the trek, they found motivation in Project Shakthi’s purpose and its tagline: ‘We climb so that girls can read,’ a deeply personal cause for both Malavath and Manyapu.
Reflecting during the Covid-19 pandemic on her own childhood during which her family moved from India to the United States “to help fulfill her dreams,” Manyapu realized that she could help girls without the same support system to also access opportunities.
“I have a three-year-old daughter, so when I look at her, I feel like it’s my responsibility to make the world at least one percent better for her and her generation,” she adds.
Manyapu comes from the same village in India as Malavath, but the two women met for the first time in 2019, when Manyapu was pregnant with her daughter.
“I’ve always been inspired by [Malavath’s] story since 2014,” Manyapu says. “I called her up and I said this is something I want to start an initiative where we could climb for a cause.
“We’ve done things for our passion so far, but how about taking our passion to serve a purpose of empowering, educating and elevating underprivileged school children?”
When Malavath embarked on her climb up Mount Everest as a 13-year-old, she was unaware about the problems of inequality which rack society.
“As I continued climbing the seven continents’ highest mountains, I came to know about that society,” she says. “And there are many girls who are struggling in rural areas and they aren’t getting any kind of opportunities.
“I always think about the students who are studying with me and the people who are in the villages… One of my friends got married at like 14 or 15 years, and now she has two kids and they are going to school. And I just finished my education.”
Malavath and Manyapu hold up their Project Shakthi logo at the summit.
Project Shakthi Team
On that climb up Everest, Malavath recalls vomiting from the exertion, remaining stuck on the expedition for “like 50 days because of weather” and being determined to summit the mountain.
“When I got an opportunity to climb Mount Everest, it was a different aim to prove that girls can do anything,” she says. “Then after that, I became a mountain lover maybe because mountains have taught me so much.”
As well as raising money for education, the project will aim to change the mindset about what women can accomplish and elevate stories that can serve as role models.
As part of this, Project Shakthi will partner with the US-based AVS Academy to pair student volunteers with girls sponsored by the organization so that they can receive one-on-one mentorship.
“I think we both together bring a story that really would help them see that what a person can do, what a girl can do,” Manyapu says. “Because I believe representation matters. And while we are at a generation where we do see women in various fields, we still have a lot of gender gap to close.”
Since August 2009, when the Indian parliament passed the landmark Right to Education Act that made education free and compulsory for all children under 14, the number of girls in school has increased, though the national averages obscure variations across the states, according to the country’s Annual Status of Education Report.
Around the world, while enrollment rates are almost equal between genders, the completion rates are still disparate – according to the World Bank, only 36% of girls complete lower secondary school compared to 44% of boys in what it calls low-income countries.
And to tackle this global issue, Project Shakthi has set its sights on broadening its goals.
Manyapu and Malavath were accompanied by a team on their expedition.
Project Shakthi Team
Manyapu and Malavath will climb Mount Aconcagua, the highest mountain in South America at 6,961 meters, in December as part of the next phase of Project Shakthi, inviting people interested in climbing to join them.
In the meantime, the project has already begun selecting girls who will receive its sponsorship through the $12,000 it has raised so far.
“Poorna and I actually visited our village back in India right after we completed our expedition of the virgin peak,” Manyapu says. “And we are starting in our village because that’s where our roots are.”
Eventually, the project will aim to sponsor girls across the globe, empowering them and exposing them to opportunities that would otherwise remain hidden, as Malavath and Manyapu continue their mission so that girls can have an education.

Retired detective and Kansas City drug kingpin charged with conspiring to run an underage sex-trafficking operation
By Scott Glover and Daniel A. Medina, CNN
Published 3:47 PM EST, Mon November 14, 2022

CNN
 — 
A veteran homicide detective in Kansas City, Kansas conspired with a local drug kingpin to help run a sex-trafficking operation involving underage girls, prosecutors alleged in an explosive indictment unsealed Monday.
Roger Golubski, a retired 35-year-veteran of the Kansas City, Kansas Police Department allegedly used his position to shield the operation from law enforcement investigations, according to the three-count indictment filed in U.S. District Court in Topeka. Golubski entered a plea of not guilty, said his attorney, Chris Joseph.
“Roger maintains his innocence and looks forward to clearing his name from these decades-old and uncorroborated allegations,” Joseph said in an email to CNN.
The sex trafficking operation, which was run out of an apartment complex in the 1990s by a local crack dealer named Cecil Brooks and two other men, victimized girls as young as 13, according to prosecutors.
In exchange for his protection, Golubski collected cash from Brooks and was allowed to “choose girls to provide him sexual services,” the indictment alleges.
Golubski, who retired from the police department in 2010, was charged in September with sexually assaulting a woman and a teenage girl two decades ago “while acting under color of law,” meaning he used his position as a police officer to commit the crimes. He has pleaded not guilty to those charges as well.
Former Kansas City detective charged with kidnapping, sexually assaulting two women
As he awaited trial under home confinement in that case, prosecutors unveiled a second indictment on Monday charging him with “conspiracy against rights” and two counts of “involuntary servitude” in connection with the alleged sex trafficking ring. Both cases stem from a years-long grand jury probe first reported by CNN last year.
According to Monday’s indictment, Brooks recruited “young girls who were runaways” or came from broken homes and kept them locked in a room at an apartment complex where he and co-defendants LeMark Roberson and Richard “Bone” Robinson used threats and physical beatings to force them to engage in sex acts. The indictment refers to two unidentified victims who allege they were held captive and forced into sex.
One of the victims told authorities she was just 16 years old when Golubski pulled her hair, choked her and raped her.
SEND A TIP:
We offer several ways to reach our journalists securely.
It was not immediately clear whether Golubski’s co-defendants appeared in court and, if so, how they pleaded to the charges. None were immediately available for comment.
Golubski first came under public scrutiny in 2016 for his work in the double murder conviction of a man named Lamonte McIntyre. McIntyre, who had served 23 years in prison, was freed in 2017 when the district attorney for Wyandotte County, which includes Kansas City, Kansas, concluded he no longer had faith in the conviction and asked a judge to dismiss the case.
Following his release, McIntyre and his mother filed a civil lawsuit in federal court against multiple officers involved in his arrest, taking particular aim at Golubski. The suit accused Golubski of using his badge to terrorize the Black community for decades. It alleged a wide array of crimes and misconduct, including sexually preying upon vulnerable Black women and of having an illicit association with Brooks, who allegedly paid Golubski for information and protection.
The case settled over the summer for $12.5 million but neither Golubski, nor the other defendants, which included fellow officers and the county government, acknowledged any wrongdoing.
The allegations centered around Golubski garnered national attention last year when Team Roc, the social justice and philanthropic arm of rapper Jay-Z’s entertainment company Roc Nation, took out a full-page ad in the Washington Post calling the alleged police corruption in Kansas City “one of the worst examples of abuse of power in U.S. history” and urged the Department of Justice to investigate Golubski and the Kansas City Kansas Police Department.

 — 
The 22-year-old University of Virginia student suspected of killing three football players and wounding two other people was facing school disciplinary action after UVA officials learned he failed to disclose his conviction last year on a misdemeanor concealed weapons charge, a school spokesperson says.
Christopher Darnell Jones Jr., a former football player, faces three counts of second-degree murder and three counts of using a handgun in the commission of a felony, UVA Police Chief Tim Longo said Monday.
Suspect accused of killing 3 University of Virginia football players is denied bond as new revelations emerge
He also faces two counts of malicious wounding, each accompanied by a firearm charge, Albemarle County prosecutor James Hingeley said Tuesday.
Jones and the victims had just returned from a school field trip in Washington, DC, late Sunday when the victims were gunned down on and near a bus on the Charlottesville campus, officials said.
The shooting claimed the lives of UVA football players Devin Chandler, Lavel Davis Jr. and D’Sean Perry, university president Jim Ryan said.
Now, with the suspect in custody, attention has turned to the school’s past dealings with him – including an investigation this fall into comments he made about having a gun.
On Wednesday, a gun shop owner said Jones had twice tried to buy a gun – once failing a background check – before buying a handgun and a rifle in separate purchases this year.
The suspect ‘repeatedly refused to cooperate’ in a gun-related probe
Jones was the subject of a pending case with the university’s judicial council when Sunday’s shooting unfolded, officials said.
Mourners honor 3 beloved students and athletes killed in the shooting
“On September 15, in the context of reviewing a potential hazing issue, UVA Student Affairs heard from a student that Mr. Jones made a comment to him about possessing a gun,” university spokesman Brian Coy said.
That person “did not see Mr. Jones in possession of a gun,” and the “comment about owning a gun was not made in conjunction with a threat,” Coy said.
“In the course of their investigation, University officials spoke with Mr. Jones’ roommate, who gave no indication of the presence of any weapons. In the course of their investigation, University officials discovered that Mr. Jones previously had been tried and convicted of a misdemeanor concealed weapons violation in 2021, for which he received a 12-month suspended sentence and a small fine.”
Throughout the investigation, Coy said, “Mr. Jones repeatedly refused to cooperate with University officials who were seeking additional information about the claims that he had a firearm and about his failure to disclose the previous misdemeanor conviction.”

So on October 27, “the Threat Assessment Team escalated his case for disciplinary action,” Coy said.
The school’s judicial council took over the case, and the results are pending, UVA Police Chief Timothy Longo Sr. said.
Jones was also involved in a hazing investigation on campus that was closed because witnesses would not cooperate, Longo said.
Suspect’s father says son was ‘real paranoid’
The motive behind the killing of three UVA Cavaliers remains a mystery, the university’s president said.
Jones was taken into custody Monday afternoon in Henrico County, about 80 miles east of Charlottesville, authorities said. His arrest ended an hours-long manhunt that prompted an overnight lockdown on UVA’s campus, with about 500 people sheltering in classrooms and libraries, Longo said.
In 2018, Jones was a freshman running back but didn’t play in any games, according to his biography on the athletics department website. A university spokesperson said he joined the team, but an old injury prevented him from practicing, and Jones went through rehabilitation and treatment. It was Jones’ only season as part of the team.
Watch out for 'leakage': These are some clues students can look out for to help prevent school violence
His father, Chris Jones Sr., told CNN affiliate WTVR that his son was “real paranoid … about something. He wouldn’t tell me everything.”
The father said his son visited him about a month ago and said some people were picking on him, and he didn’t know how to handle it, Jones Sr. told WTVR. The father said he told his son to just go to class and ignore them.
The father said he couldn’t believe what authorities said his son did and apologized for his alleged actions.
Jones went to Varina High School in Henrico County – about 30 minutes from Petersburg – for three years where he was a star football player, a member of the National Honor Society, president of the Key Club and student of the year as a freshman and sophomore, according to the UVA football website.
He played his senior season at Petersburg High School where he was honorable mention all-conference as a running back and linebacker.
Jones bought handgun in July, shop owner says
According to a Colonial Heights gun shop owner, Jones bought a Glock 45 – a 9mm pistol – in July and a Ruger AR-556 – an AR-15-style rifle – in February.
There was “nothing noteworthy” about those purchases, Dance’s Sporting Goods owner Marlon Dance said in an email.
But Jones tried to buy a handgun in 2018 before he turned 21 and was denied, Dance said. In 2021, he tried to buy a Smith & Wesson semiautomatic rifle but failed a background check, according to Dance.
“Jones DID NOT receive either of the firearms he attempted to purchase, and both attempted purchases were forwarded to the Virginia State Police for further action,” Dance wrote.
CNN reached out to University of Virginia Police for comment on the investigation and the gun used in the shooting but has not head back.
Colonial Heights is just north of Petersburg.

 — 
Amazon founder Jeff Bezos plans to give away the majority of his $124 billion net worth during his lifetime, telling CNN in an exclusive interview he will devote the bulk of his wealth to fighting climate change and supporting people who can unify humanity in the face of deep social and political divisions.
Though Bezos’ vow was light on specifics, this marks the first time he has announced that he plans to give away most of his money. Critics have chided Bezos for not signing the Giving Pledge, a promise by hundreds of the world’s richest people to donate the majority of their wealth to charitable causes.

Exclusive: Jeff Bezos offers his advice on taking risks right now
01:50 - Source: CNN
In a sit-down interview with CNN’s Chloe Melas on Saturday at his Washington, DC, home, Bezos, speaking alongside his partner, the journalist-turned-philanthropist Lauren Sánchez, said the couple is “building the capacity to be able to give away this money.”
Asked directly by CNN whether he intends to donate the majority of his wealth within his lifetime, Bezos said: “Yeah, I do.”
Bezos said he and Sánchez agreed to their first interview together since they began dating in 2019 to help shine a spotlight on the Bezos Courage and Civility Award, granted this year to musician Dolly Parton.
The 20-minute exchange with Bezos and Sánchez covered a broad range of topics, from Bezos’s views on political dialogue and a possible economic recession to Sánchez’s plan to visit outer space with an all-female crew and her reflections on a flourishing business partnership with Bezos.
Dolly Parton
That working relationship was on display Saturday as Bezos and Sánchez announced a $100 million grant to Parton as part of her Courage and Civility Award. It is the third such award, following similar grants to chef Jose Andrés, who has spent some of the money making meals for Ukrainians — and the climate advocate and CNN contributor Van Jones.
Dolly Parton receives $100 million Courage and Civility Award from Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez
“When you think of Dolly,” said Sánchez in the interview, “Look, everyone smiles, right? She is just beaming with light. And all she wants to do is bring light into other people’s worlds. And so we couldn’t have thought of someone better than to give this award to Dolly, and we know she’s going to do amazing things with it.”
The throughline connecting the Courage and Civility Award grantees, Bezos said, was their capacity to bring many people together to solve large challenges.
“I just feel honored to be able to be a part of what they’re doing for this world,” Bezos told CNN.
Unity, Bezos said, is a trait that will be necessary to confront climate change and one that he repeatedly invoked as he blasted politicians and social media for amplifying division.
How to give it away
But the couple’s biggest challenge may be figuring out how to distribute Bezos’ vast fortune. Bezos declined to identify a specific percentage or to provide concrete details on where it would likely be spent.
Despite being the fourth-wealthiest person in the world, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, Bezos has refrained from setting a target amount to give away in his lifetime.
Bezos has committed $10 billion over 10 years, or about 8% of his current net worth, to the Bezos Earth Fund, which Sánchez co-chairs. Among its priorities are reducing the carbon footprint of construction-grade cement and steel; pushing financial regulators to consider climate-related risks; advancing data and mapping technologies to monitor carbon emissions; and building natural, plant-based carbon sinks on a large scale.
Bezos donates $100 million each to CNN contributor Van Jones and chef Jose Andres
Though Bezos is now Amazon’s (AMZN) executive chair and not its CEO — he stepped down from that role in 2021 — he is still involved in the greening of the company. Amazon is one of more than 300 companies that have pledged to reduce their carbon footprint by 2040 according to the principles of the Paris Climate Agreement, Bezos said, though Amazon’s (AMZN) footprint grew by 18% in 2021, reflecting a pandemic-driven e-commerce boom. Amazon’s (AMZN) reckoning with its own effect on the climate mirrors its outsized impact on everything from debates about unionization to antitrust policy, where the company has attracted an enormous level of scrutiny from regulators, lawmakers, and civil society groups.
Bezos compared his philanthropic strategy to his years-long effort constructing a titanic engine of e-commerce and cloud computing that has made him one of the most powerful people in the world.
“The hard part is figuring out how to do it in a levered way,” he said, implying that even as he gives away his billions, he is still looking to maximize his return. “It’s not easy. Building Amazon was not easy. It took a lot of hard work, a bunch of very smart teammates, hard-working teammates, and I’m finding — and I think Lauren is finding the same thing — that charity, philanthropy, is very similar.”
“There are a bunch of ways that I think you could do ineffective things, too,” he added. “So you have to think about it carefully and you have to have brilliant people on the team.”
Bezos’ methodical approach to giving stands in sharp contrast to that of his ex-wife, the philanthropist MacKenzie Scott, who recently gave away nearly $4 billion to 465 organizations in the span of less than a year.
The economic downturn
While Bezos and Sánchez plot out their plans for Bezos’ immense wealth, many people of more modest means are bracing for what economists fear may be an extended economic downturn.
Last month, Bezos tweeted a warning to his followers on Twitter, recommending that they “batten down the hatches.”
'Batten down the hatches': Bezos and fellow billionaires are issuing recession warnings
The advice was meant for business owners and consumers alike, Bezos said in the interview, suggesting that individuals should consider putting off buying big ticket items they’ve been eyeing — or that companies should slow their acquisitions and capital expenditures.
“Take some risk off the table,” Bezos said. “Keep some dry powder on hand…. Just a little bit of risk reduction could make the difference for that small business, if we do get into even more serious economic problems. You’ve got to play the probabilities a little bit.”
Many may be feeling the pinch now, he added, but argued that as an optimist he believes the American Dream “is and will be even more attainable in the future” — projecting that within Bezos’ lifetime, space travel could become broadly accessible to the public.
Bezos and Sánchez’s partnership
Sánchez said the couple make “really great teammates,” though she laughed, “We can be kind of boring,” Sánchez said. Bezos smiled and replied, “Never boring.”
Sánchez, the founder of Black Ops Aviation, the first female-owned and operated aerial film and production company is a trained helicopter pilot. She said in the interview that they’ve both taken turns in the driver’s seat.
Bezos has credited his own journey to space for helping to inspire his push to fight climate change. Now, it is Sánchez’s turn.
Sánchez told CNN she anticipates venturing into orbit herself sometime in 2023. And while she did not directly address who will be joining her — quickly ruling out Bezos as a crewmate — she said simply: “It’ll be a great group of females.”
Washington’s NFL team
Jay-Z and Jeff Bezos are interested in buying the Washington Commanders together
Bezos may be adding NFL owner to his resume. CNN recently reported that Bezos and Jay-Z are in talks on a potential joint bid on the Washington Commanders.
It is not clear if the two have yet spoken with Dan Snyder and his wife, Tanya, the current owners of the NFL team, about the possibility.
But during the interview on Saturday, Melas asked Bezos if the speculation was true.
“Yes, I’ve heard that buzz,” Bezos said with a smile.
Sánchez chimed in with a laugh, “I do like football. I’m just going to throw that out there for everyone.”
Bezos added, “I grew up in Houston, Texas, and I played football growing up as a kid … and it is my favorite sport … so we’ll just have to wait and see.”

First on CNN: Former White House aide Hutchinson will testify Wednesday before Atlanta-area grand jury
By Jake Tapper, Sara Murray and Zachary Cohen, CNN
Updated 10:58 PM EST, Mon November 14, 2022
Cassidy Hutchinson, who was an aide to former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, testifies during a public hearing of the House January 6 committee, June 28, 2022.
Andrew Harnik/Reuters
CNN
 — 
Former White House aide Cassidy Hutchinson will testify Wednesday before an Atlanta-area special grand jury probing efforts by former President Donald Trump and his allies to overturn the 2020 election in Georgia, a source familiar with the matter told CNN.
Hutchinson, a former top aide to then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, previously cooperated with investigations by the House select committee investigating January 6, 2021, and the Justice Department.
CNN reported last month that Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis had secured Hutchinson’s cooperation in the investigation.
Hutchinson could offer Georgia prosecutors insights about what she witnessed in the West Wing, as well as specific steps her former boss took related to Georgia. In public testimony before the January 6 committee this summer, she revealed how Trump and his inner circle were warned about the potential for violence on January 6, and how the former president wanted to join the throngs of his supporters at the Capitol.
The Georgia probe – set off by an hour-long January 2021 phone call from Trump to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger asking him to “find” the votes necessary for Trump to win the Peach State – has steadily expanded with time.
It now covers presentations on unfounded election fraud claims to state lawmakers, the fake elector scheme, efforts by unauthorized individuals to access voting machines in one Georgia county and a campaign of threats and harassment against lower-level election workers.
For months, the special grand jury has been scrutinizing those events to determine whether any of them may have been illegal. When the panel, which does not have the power to issue indictments, completes its work, it is expected to issue a report with recommendations, including whether anyone should face criminal charges.
Kemp also to appear this week
Another notable figure expected to appear before the grand jury this week is Georgia Republican Gov. Brian Kemp, who is slated to testify Tuesday, a source told CNN.
The Tuesday grand jury appearance was first reported by the Atlanta-Journal Constitution.
A judge previously said Kemp, who sailed to reelection last week, would not have to testify until after the midterm elections. Judge Robert McBurney, who oversees the grand jury, rejected Kemp’s earlier efforts to quash his subpoena but said there would be limits to the questions Kemp could be asked.
Among the topics prosecutors are eager to ask Kemp about is a December 2020 phone call in which Trump allegedly tried to push Kemp to convince state legislators to overturn Joe Biden’s win in the Peach State.
This story has been updated with additional details.
CNN’s Paul LeBlanc contributed to this report.

Experimental therapy gantenerumab fails to slow or improve Alzheimer’s memory loss in clinical trials
By Brenda Goodman, CNN

How Alzheimer's disease destroys the brain
01:38 - Source: CNN
CNN
 — 
An experimental treatment, gantenerumab, failed to help people at high risk of memory loss from Alzheimer’s or those who were in the early phases of the disease, the manufacturer said Monday.
Gantenerumab is part of a class of injected drugs that are designed to remove sticky protein pieces called beta amyloid from the brain. Beta amyloid buildup is a hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease.
1 in 10 Americans over 65 have dementia, study finds
Most of these drugs have worked as intended to clear the beta amyloid, but many have still failed to demonstrate any real-life benefits to patients; their brain function and memory doesn’t improve significantly, despite treatment.
Roche said Monday that gantenerumab appears to have removed less beta amyloid from the brains of study participants than anticipated. The company said the results from Phase 3 of its trials, called Graduate, were hard but important to share.
“So many of our families have been directly affected by Alzheimer’s, so this news is very disappointing to deliver,” Dr. Levi Garraway, Roche’s chief medical officer and head of global product development, said in a news release. “While the GRADUATE results are not what we hoped, we are proud to have delivered a high quality, clear and comprehensive Alzheimer’s dataset to the field, and we look forward to sharing our learnings with the community as we continue to search for new treatments for this complex disease.”
Experimental Alzheimer's drug may have contributed to death of study participant, according to reports
Roche said it would share more findings from its study at an upcoming medical conference.
The results for gantenerumab follow positive results for a different beta amyloid reducing drug, lecanemab. The companies testing that medication, Biogen and Eisai, announced this year that lecanemab had slowed the decline of brain function in Alzheimer’s disease by about 27% compared with a placebo. Some experts feel that degree of benefit is on par with that of the controversial Alzheimer’s drug Aduhelm, which was approved by the US Food and Drug Adminstration despite a lack of support from the agency’s independent advisers.
Dr. Constantine Lyketsos, a professor of psychiatry at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, said that if gantenerumab had removed as much beta amyloid as the company predicted it would, it might have shown a degree of benefit in line with lecanemab and Aduhelm.
“In other words, a very modest but not clinically significant effect,” said Lyketsos, who was not involved in the research.

The Alzheimer’s Association said in a statement that the results of Roche’s study are “disappointing,” but it remains “hopeful for this class of treatment.”
“Each anti-amyloid treatment being tested acts in a different way, and research into their effectiveness and safety must continue. It is important to evaluate each treatment independently,” Maria Carrillo, the nonprofit’s chief scientific officer, said in the statement.
An estimated 6.5 million Americans are living with Alzheimer’s disease in 2022, according to the Alzheimer’s Association.

John King: What Hobbs' projected win in Arizona means for Democrats02:10
Nov. 14, 2022 US election coverage
By Aditi Sangal, Elise Hammond, Maureen Chowdhury and Mike Hayes, CNN
Updated 8:33 AM ET, Tue November 15, 2022
What we covered here
Arizona decision: Democrat Katie Hobbs will win the race for Arizona governor, CNN projects.
Where things stand in House races: Republicans appear to be inching closer to the 218 seats that would deliver them a House majority, but 16 congressional races — including several in California — remain uncalled.
Democrats keep the Senate: Democrats will maintain their narrow Senate majority, CNN projects, after victories in close contests in Nevada and Arizona.
Meanwhile in Georgia: The state's Senate contest is headed to a Dec. 6 runoff, and a Democratic victory there would broaden the party's majority in the chamber.
GOP leadership elections: As control of the House hangs in the balance, Republicans held a candidate forum Monday. It will be followed by internal leadership elections on Tuesday.

CNN Projection: Democrat Katie Hobbs will defeat Republican Kari Lake in Arizona gubernatorial race
From CNN's Maeve Reston

Democrat Katie Hobbs will win Arizona’s governor’s race, CNN projects, defeating one of the most prominent defenders of former President Donald Trump’s lies about the 2020 election. 
Calling the 2020 election rigged, Republican Kari Lake had repeatedly said she would not have certified Joe Biden’s win in Arizona in 2020. Hobbs, as Arizona’s secretary of state, had rejected GOP lies about the election. 
Lake’s defeat follows the defeat of two other high-profile election deniers in the state – Republican Senate nominee Blake Masters and secretary of state nominee Mark Finchem. 
Before the projection, Lake had already begun sowing doubts about the 2022 results.
During an appearance on right-wing activist Charlie Kirk's talk show Thursday, she said, ""I hate that they're slow-rolling and dragging their feet and delaying the inevitable. They don't want to put out the truth, which is that we won."" 
There is no evidence that the election officials were delaying the reporting of results. At a news conference Thursday, Bill Gates, chairman of the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors, called out Lake’s comments. “It is offensive for Kari Lake to say that these people behind me are slow-rolling this when they are working 14-18 hours,” Gates, a Republican, said, gesturing to the election workers who were involved in tallying the ballots behind him through a glass window. 
Lake, a former news anchor at Fox 10 in Phoenix, ascended quickly to become one of the most prominent Republicans in the 2022 cycle as she and Hobbs vied to replace term-limited Republican Gov. Doug Ducey. The outgoing governor had endorsed Lake’s primary opponent, but then backed Lake in the general election. 
Hobbs, a former social worker who worked with victims of domestic violence before becoming a state lawmaker, ran a far more low-key and understated campaign, limiting her access to reporters and holding small, intimate events with supporters. She made democracy and abortion rights her central focus, portraying Lake as an “extreme” and “dangerous” figure who could jeopardize the sanctity of the 2024 presidential election by refusing to certify the results. 
Lake hewed closely to the Trump playbook on more than just the 2020 election. She promised to declare an “invasion” at the border — in what she described as an effort to amass greater power for the governor’s office to address the migrant crisis — and she called for the arrest of both of Dr. Anthony Fauci and her Democratic opponent. 
Before announcing her bid, Lake left her anchor job in 2021 — stating that she didn’t like the direction that journalism was going — after becoming a household name in Phoenix. In one of her campaign videos, she said she was taking a sledgehammer to “leftist lies and propaganda,” as she destroyed television sets with the tool in stiletto boots.

Hobbs' lead narrows after Maricopa County releases new ballots
From CNN staff
Maricopa County, Arizona’s most populous county, released more than 71,000 votes Monday evening, slightly narrowing the lead held by Democrat Katie Hobbs over Republican candidate Kari Lake for the state's governor's race.
In the first installment of votes released, Lake got about 57% of the votes vs 43% for Hobbs, CNN's John King noted.
It's unclear, he said, if that will be enough to overtake Hobbs' lead.
Watch CNN's John King full analysis below.

Arizona Secretary of State-elect Adrian Fontes said that although the election system in the state is not quick, it is thorough.
The state is expecting to release more results Monday night. Fontes thanked election officials across Arizona for the work they have done processing ballots since Election Day.
Fontes told CNN that as the new election chief, he does not plan to make changes to Arizona’s election system because “there’s no reason to.”
“Just because we're living in a world of instant gratification doesn't mean that we should sacrifice accuracy, accountability and security so that folks can, you know, click away,"" he told CNN's Erin Burnett. ""Arizona's election systems are solid, and we've been doing a real good job for a long, long time.""
The new elections chief added that the difference between recent years and past elections is the tight margins. This means it takes longer for races to be projected because not one candidate is winning by a large number of votes, he said.
Fontes, a Democrat, defeated Republican challenger Mark Finchem, a self-proclaimed member of the far-right extremist group the Oath Keepers, who called the 2020 election “irredeemably compromised.”
Though Fontes won the election, he said he doesn’t think the state is past the moment of people distrusting the vote counting system.
“This isn't a one and done sort of an exercise. The cancer that is is election denialism, the disease that's pervaded over the last couple of years for all the wrong reasons, has to be flushed out bit by bit. It's going to take a long time for a lot of folks to regain confidence that they should never have lost in the first place in our election system,” he said.
""I'm proud to do that work as well as I can — working with the coalition of independents and Republicans who came forward in my campaign to help us bring reason and some truth into these processes,” Fontes added.
Some context: In Arizona, in addition to in-person voting, voters have the option to mail or drop off their ballots on Election Day. The state doesn’t even start the important process of signature verification on any of those ballots until the Wednesday after the election, according to officials.
Most states have some sort of signature verification system for their absentee and mail-in ballots, according to a tally from the National Conference of State Legislatures.

McCarthy pledges to kick Omar, Swalwell and Schiff off key committees if he becomes speaker
From CNN's Melanie Zanona
House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy promised Monday that he would kick key Democrats off committees if his party gains control of the lower chamber.
McCarthy said that he would remove Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar from the House Foreign Affairs Committee and Democratic Reps. Eric Swalwell and Adam Schiff from the House Intelligence Committee, according to a source in the room during a Republican conference leadership forum.
The California Republican is vying to become speaker of the House.
CNN has not yet projected which party will control the lower chamber, though Republicans appear on track to gain a narrow House majority.
Some context: The vote to elect the next speaker will take place in January at the start of the new Congress, but House Republicans are holding their internal leadership elections to pick a speaker nominee this week.
Republicans held a candidate forum Monday evening. It will be followed by leadership elections on Tuesday, according to a copy of the schedule shared with CNN.

GOP Sen. Josh Hawley on Monday said the midterm election ""was the funeral for the Republican Party as we know it.""
“I think that this election was the funeral for the Republican Party as we know it,” he said at the US Capitol as he headed to vote. “The Republican Party as we have known it is dead –– and voters have made that clear.”
The Missouri senator added:
""We need to be thinking about what the future here is. I like a lot of what President Trump did as president. I think we've got a lot to talk about there. But we need to have a conversation about our core convictions to the party and clearly this party is going to have to, actually it's going to have to be different, or we're not going to be a majority party in this country.""
On whether he supports Trump running in 2024, Hawley said, ""I'm not gonna give him advice, he'll choose to do what he's gonna do.""

Analysis: These Republicans admit the party has an extremism problem
From CNN's Zachary B. Wolf
Confronted with an unexpected moment of reckoning, some moderate Republicans are pointing out that the party has some important decisions to make about its future: 
Are they going to be the party of former President Donald Trump or a party that wins elections?
Are they going to be able to excise the ""extremism"" in their party that more Republicans are openly talking about?
First test: The first indication of where the party is headed will come this week when Republicans, anticipating they will ultimately hold a slim House majority, choose their nominee for speaker.
Some of the most Trump-aligned lawmakers want Rep. Kevin McCarthy to commit to a more combative stance against the Biden administration. While McCarthy expects to prevail, the unfolding drama will show what he has to sacrifice to keep Republicans in the House on the same page. CNN reported Monday that Trump has been quietly working to shore up support for McCarthy. 
Moving beyond extremism: Two moderate Republican governors who will be handing over their jobs to Democrats next year are speaking out about how their party failed in a year when it should have romped.
""Voters, generally speaking, especially in battleground states, aren't interested in extremism. They just aren't,"" Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker told CNN's Jake Tapper in an interview that aired Monday on ""The Lead."" Baker, who will be replaced by Democratic attorney general Maura Healey in January, said Trump's influence hurt Republicans on Election Day and is driving people from the party.
Third strike for Trump: Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, long a Trump critic, was more unvarnished in his criticism during an interview Sunday on CNN's ""State of the Union."" 
""Commonsense conservatives that focused on talking about issues people cared about, like the economy and crime and education, they did win,"" Hogan told Dana Bash. ""But people who tried to relitigate the 2020 election and focused on conspiracy theories and talked about things the voters didn't care about, they were almost universally rejected.""
In that regard, American voters were sophisticated, splitting tickets to elect Republicans in certain races and Democrats in others.
Hogan, who will be replaced by Democrat Wes Moore in January, said this is the third straight election Trump has cost Republicans. ""It's like three strikes, you're out,"" he said, adding, ""the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again, expecting a different result. And Donald Trump kept saying, 'We're going to be winning so much, we will get tired of winning.' I'm tired of losing. I mean, that's all he's done.""
Others are not quite as direct, even if they're saying some similar things.

No candidate announced a run against McCarthy for House GOP leadership, sources say
From CNN's Manu Raju, Annie Grayer and Melanie Zanona
No candidate stood up to announce a run against House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy once he finished speaking and taking questions at a post-election Republican conference meeting Monday, according to two sources in the room.
A candidate can still stand up to run tomorrow when the leadership election is held. 
Some context: The vote to elect the next speaker will take place in January at the start of the new Congress, but House Republicans are holding their internal leadership elections to pick a speaker nominee this week.
Republicans held a candidate forum Monday evening. It will be followed by leadership elections on Tuesday, according to a copy of the schedule shared with CNN.

McCarthy addressed Republican conference and got a standing ovation 
From CNN's Manu Raju

House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy addressed the Republican conference behind closed doors Monday and got a standing ovation at the first post-election meeting, according to a source familiar with the meeting.
“They don’t give out gavels in small, medium, and large — we have the majority and we have the gavels,” he said.
It was a call for unity, a source said, adding that McCarthy said, “We will win as a team — or we will lose as individuals.""
One member in the room said McCarthy was taking questions from lawmakers in the audience. Some members were standing up to show support, while others raised concerns to see what rule changes McCarthy will make.
Rep. Matt Gaetz asked McCarthy if he would try to solicit or accept speaker votes from any Democrats, according to a source in the room. McCarthy told him “no.”
Sources told CNN today that McCarthy allies had tried to convince moderate Democratic Rep. Henry Cuellar to switch parties. The Texas congressman's office said it was not an idea he would entertain.
Some context: The vote to elect the next speaker will take place in January at the start of the new Congress, but House Republicans will hold their internal leadership elections to pick a speaker nominee this week.

McCarthy allies tried to convince moderate Democrat to switch parties
From CNN's Daniella Diaz, Melanie Zanona and Manu Raju
With a razor-thin majority looking likely, allies of House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy recently attempted to convince moderate Democratic Rep. Henry Cuellar to switch parties in hopes of padding their slim margins, according to two sources familiar with the conversation. But Cuellar flatly rejected the idea, the sources said.
McCarthy’s spokesperson said the Republican leader was not involved if these conversations took place and said this is not in any way part of their strategy for the majority or for his speakership bid. 
""Anyone suggesting this is simply exercising in fan fiction,” said McCarthy spokesperson Mark Bednar. “Leader McCarthy is going to be elected Speaker by the current and newly-elected members of the House Republican Conference. Our efforts are exclusively focused on bringing our conference together and saving the country.""
Cuellar’s office did not confirm whether he spoke to any McCarthy allies about switching parties but made clear it was not an idea he would entertain.
“As a standard rule we do not discuss private conversations between members of Congress,” Cuellar’s office said. “However, Congressman Cuellar is a lifelong Democrat and will remain a Democrat. Period.”
The Wall Street Journal was the first to report the outreach to Cuellar.

Hear the call that proves a senior officer was told of kids trapped with Uvalde shooter
07:53 - Source: CNN
Exclusive: New audio of phone call shows for the first time that a senior Uvalde officer was told children needed to be rescued from inside a classroom
By Shimon Prokupecz, Matthew J. Friedman and Rachel Clarke, CNN
Updated 11:15 PM EST, Mon November 14, 2022
Uvalde, Texas
CNN
 — 
Uvalde’s acting police chief knew there were “eight to nine” children alive and needing rescue from a shooter in the classrooms at Robb Elementary but failed to organize help, new audio of a phone call and CNN analysis of newly obtained video shows.
Lt. Mariano Pargas called his Uvalde Police Department dispatchers to get details after they relayed a call over the police radio from 10-year-old Khloie Torres that she was in a room “full of victims,” according to a recorded conversation obtained by CNN from sources close to the investigation into the failed law enforcement response to the massacre.
Communication failures and a lack of leadership in the chaotic response are blamed for why it took 77 minutes to stop the gunman who holed up in two conjoining classrooms, with some officers saying they were not made aware of the 911 calls from children and others saying they could not hear radio transmissions.
Pargas’s phone call proves for the first time that a senior officer was directly made aware of a 911 call from inside the classroom and was given details on the exact location of children who were alive and begging to be rescued.
The conversation, recorded routinely as part of police procedure, shows Pargas calling at 12:16 p.m., about six minutes after Khloie reached 911 and when she was still on the line with a dispatcher, and four minutes after the call information was relayed on the Uvalde police radio channel.
“The calls you got in from the … from one of the students, what did they say?” he asks.
The dispatcher responds: “OK, Khloie’s going to be, it’s Khloie. She’s in Room 112, Mariano, 112.”
Pargas asks: “So how many are still alive?” and is told: “Eight to nine are still alive. She’s not too sure … She’s not too sure how many are actually DOA or possibly injured. We’re trying …”
Pargas ends the call with “OK, OK thanks” and disconnects.
Pargas, seen on a recording from an officer's body-worn camera, called his dispatchers outside the school.
City of Uvalde
Based on analysis of surveillance and body cameras at the scene, he walks back into the hallway at 12:17 p.m. and mentions injured victims to a Border Patrol officer. At 12:18 p.m., he does not mention the children when a Texas Ranger talks to him about organizing the flow of information.
Pargas is last observed walking away from the school’s entrance at 12:20 p.m. New angles of the hallway security cameras obtained by CNN confirm Pargas does not reenter the hallway near room 112 where officers are gathering and eventually breach the classroom door some 30 minutes later.
Officers entered the classrooms and killed the shooter at 12:50 p.m., 77 minutes after he began his murderous rampage inside the school. Nineteen children and two teachers died after the attack in Uvalde, Texas, last May 24. At least three of the dead – two children and one teacher – survived their initial injuries and died after the classrooms were breached.
Interactive: Uvalde under scrutiny: What we know about the key figures connected to the shooting response
Pargas was placed on administrative leave by Uvalde Mayor Don McLaughlin in July when videos from body cameras raised questions about whether he had taken any action to assume command. “This administrative leave is to investigate whether Lt. Pargas was responsible for taking command on May 24th, what specific actions Lt. Pargas took to establish that command, and whether it was even feasible given all the agencies involved and other possible policy violations,” McLaughlin said in a statement at the time.
The recording of the phone call newly obtained by CNN only seems to underscore Pargas’s inaction.
When CNN reached Pargas by phone seeking comment for this story, he said he was unable to talk about anything to do with the police department on the advice of his lawyers.
Lt. Mariano Pargas, in a photo from Uvalde Police Department, was placed on leave in July.

“I want to defend myself. I really do,” he said on Monday. “There’s a lot of stuff that I can explain, that I would love to defend myself. And that’s the problem we’re having right now … the victims and everybody’s saying everything they want to say, but we can’t say nothing because we were told not to talk to, you know, we can’t say anything cause we’re still under that, not to talk to any, media or anything.”
He added: “It’s not that we’re afraid because there’s nothing to be afraid of. We did what we could, but the thing is that we’ve been told that we can’t (speak publicly).”
Just last week, Pargas was reelected as a Uvalde county commissioner after defeating three write-in candidates including Javier Cazares, who lost his daughter Jackie in the shooting.
Clear details and no action
The audio of the 911 calls from Khloie Torres and her classmate Miah Cerrillo, published exclusively by CNN with the approval of the girls’ parents, revealed the girls gave details and directions to the authorities at 12:10 p.m., more than 30 minutes after officers started arriving en masse at the school but still a full 40 minutes before forces entered the room to challenge and kill the shooter. Later in the call, after gunshots are heard, Miah says of the killer, “He’s shooting.”

Recounting what happened in an interview with a Texas Ranger and an FBI agent two days after the shooting, Pargas makes no mention of being aware at the time that children were with the shooter in the conjoining classrooms of 111 and 112, or of the 911 call, according to records of interviews obtained by CNN.
But he did know that teacher Eva Mireles had been shot in her classroom as he was told by her husband, a former member of Pargas’s police department then working for the school police, Pargas said. He said he observed the officer, Ruben Ruiz, tensing, and decided he should be disarmed and taken out of the hallway.

“He was holding the gun real tight,” Pargas said of Ruiz in his interview. “And we were just afraid that he was gonna try to run in the classroom and try to do what I wanted to do if I could have done it.”
In a second interview in mid-June, when prompted about 911 calls from inside the classroom, Pargas said he did not have a clear memory. “I don’t remember. I really don’t,” he said. “I know somebody said, and I’m not sure if it was dispatch or somebody, I remember somebody saying that they thought there was a kid calling and calling dispatch that he was inside.”
Asked if he relayed that information, he replied: “I’m almost sure I did to the people that were lined up (in the hallway).”
Pargas enters the hallway to tell other officers there were victims with the shooter. Communication issues that day included radios not working inside the school building.
City of Uvalde
Pargas did not mention his follow-up call with his department and said he did not know for sure there were children in the rooms with the gunman.
“We didn’t know who or what was in there because he was so quiet,” he told a Ranger. “We had no idea.”
Later in the interview, he added: “The last thing we thought was that he had actually shot the kids. We thought he had shot up in the air, broken the lights. We had no idea what was behind those doors.”
Why the chief didn’t take charge
Pargas was acting chief of the Uvalde Police Department on the day of the massacre, while Chief Daniel Rodriguez was on vacation.
He told investigators he rushed to the vicinity of the school – about a mile and a half away – when someone came into his office to say there had been an accident and there was a man with a rifle.
CNN analysis of video from surveillance and body cameras shows Pargas was the fifth officer to run into the school hallway after the gunman.
Pargas, to the right in a blue shirt, entered the hallway at 11:36 a.m.
Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District
Three of Pargas’s UPD officers were shot at as they approached the classrooms where the gunman had holed up, and two were injured.
But Pargas said he did not consider who should be in charge, especially once he saw then-school police chief Pedro “Pete” Arredondo.
“The minute I saw Pete Arredondo … I figured this is school property and we’re here to assist pretty much. That’s normally what we do – when something happens in the school, we pretty much assist the school because it’s their jurisdiction,” Pargas told the Ranger gathering information in mid-June.
“I don’t think I stopped to say, well, who’s giving orders or who’s in command. We’re just trying to see what we could do as fast as we could.”
Arredondo has said he never considered himself the incident commander, though he did try to negotiate with the shooter as well as issue orders to those in the hallway with him.
More officers from more local, state, and federal agencies arrived, and there was no clear direction of what was going on inside or outside the school building.
Pargas, left, here being asked by one of his officers if they had to wait for a specialist team, told investigators he assumed school police chief Pedro ""Pete"" Arredondo was in charge.
City of Uvalde
As they stood at the entrance door at 12:10 p.m., guns drawn but static, a UPD detective asks Pargas about the Border Patrol tactical team: “Are we just waiting for BORTAC, or what’s going on?”
Pargas responds: “Yeah, they tell me the DPS Ranger found somebody and they’re going to come in.”
Another local officer then asks him for an “OIC” – an officer in charge – and Pargas appears to direct him to Texas Ranger Christopher Ryan Kindell, who is himself now suspended and under investigation for actions he failed to take at Robb Elementary.
Pargas’s thoughts on whether to take charge did not appear to change as time went by and more information came out.
A Texas House committee report into the tragedy at Robb Elementary said the lack of any effective incident command was a key problem. The report, which faults the choices Pargas made, said the fact that UPD officers responding to reports of a crash and a man with a gun were first on scene would have made them initial commanders, and while Arredondo could then have assumed command at the school he would have needed to go outside the building to coordinate effectively.
Pargas, center, did not mention the victims in the classroom to Ranger Christopher Ryan Kindell, left, when the two spoke at 12:18 p.m.
Uvalde Game Warden
Pargas had arrived at the school where his granddaughter was a student without a radio and may not have heard the transmission about Khloie’s call.
But one of his detectives made sure he was aware of what was said.
“Full of victims, child called 911 saying the room’s full of victims,” he is told at 12:12 p.m., as seen on footage from a body camera worn by another officer.
“The room is full of victims,” the detective reiterates as Pargas pulls the radio from the detective’s vest. “Child 911, child 911 call.”
Pargas then walks inside the school building where officers from local, state and federal law enforcement agencies were lined up at the end of a hallway leading to the classrooms.
“A child just called that they have victims in there,” he says before turning and leaving the area.
Two days after the massacre, Pargas told an investigator he wished more could have been done.
But then he gives some praise to the operation: “I think keeping him contained, I think it did save a lot more lives that could have been taken that day.”

US studying how to modify powerful armed drone as Ukrainian demand grows
By Alex Marquardt, CNN

 — 
As Russian forces have retreated in Ukraine’s south, the Biden administration has announced a slew of new military aid packages for Ukraine, but all were missing a piece of weaponry that Ukraine’s military has long sought: the multi-use Gray Eagle drone, armed with Hellfire missiles.
According to two officials, the US has been looking into modifications that can be made to the deadly drone. Changes that would make the potential of losing any – with their sensitive onboard technology – less of a danger and possibly increase the likelihood of Ukraine receiving them.
“There are specific and very technical tweaks and neutering that can be done to these that may make it possible in the nearer term,” a congressional official said. “But those things take time and are fairly complex.”
A US official confirmed that the Army is leading the efforts to study what changes are possible to the drone, which is made by General Atomics and referred to in the Army as the MQ-1C.
“When you’re talking drones, this is about as good as you can get,” says Seth Jones, the director of the International Security Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “These are really sophisticated drones.”
CIA Director Bill Burns meeting with Russian counterpart Monday
Without any changes however, the Gray Eagle, which can carry four Hellfire missiles and fly at 25,000 feet for almost 30 hours, would likely not be on upcoming lists of military aid allocated to Ukraine.
“There’s still real interest in providing this particular system, provided we can make the necessary modifications and they are still useful to Ukraine on the battlefield,” the US official said.
Discussions over the Gray Eagle are ongoing and it has not been ruled out or officially denied to Ukraine, the US official and a Ukrainian official said. The Wall Street Journal previously reported that the Pentagon had declined Ukraine’s request.
Ukraine is ‘pushing back’
“We are pushing back, we didn’t give up,” the Ukrainian official said. “This is about survivability [for Ukraine].”
Pentagon spokesman Colonel Roger Cabiness would not comment specifically on the Gray Eagle, saying only that the Department of Defense continues to consult with Ukraine on security assistance.
The White House declined to comment and General Atomics did not respond to a request for comment.
On top of the lethal capability of the missiles it carries, the Gray Eagle would allow Ukrainian forces greater ability to gather intelligence and carry out reconnaissance from farther away, expand the assistance of targeting by artillery on the ground and combat the drones flown by Russia.
Throughout the war, the US has been slow and reluctant to provide Ukraine with dramatically more advanced and longer-range capabilities, like missiles that would allow Ukraine to strike inside Russia and therefore potentially be seen by Moscow as a significant escalation in the conflict.

In the case of the Gray Eagle, a US official argued, the concern is less about escalation than technological security: the potential for the pricey drones to go down in Ukraine and be recovered by the Russians.
“These are very expensive systems and there are concerns that they could be shot down,” said the official, declining to say what parts of the drone would be most dangerous if they end up in Russian hands.
It’s a scenario that the US has recently been on the receiving end of. After Iranian drones were shot down in Ukraine, the US was able to examine the wreckage, the Washington Post reported.
The US official declined to elaborate on what technology on the Gray Eagle is the most sensitive but said they wouldn’t be considered escalatory since similar capabilities are being provided.
The technology in question likely centers on the imaging and intelligence-gathering capabilities and sensors, Jones from CSIS said, adding that he believes US fears are really rooted more in escalating the conflict with Russia.’
“You’re really going to fly those pretty far back from the frontlines,” he said. “I don’t think you’d risk them up close and you wouldn’t need them up close because they can fire from a distance and they can collect [intelligence] from a distance.”
US has modified weapon systems before
This wouldn’t be the first time modifications have been made to US systems to get them to Ukraine. The Wall Street Journal reported in March that classified components were removed from Stinger antiaircraft missiles by simply taking out several screws. That was enough for the US to be able to ship them out.
Like the Gray Eagle, the US has also so far pushed back on requests for the long-range ATAMCS missiles, with a range of around 200 miles (300 kilometers). Ukraine is so keen to get them that they have offered a remarkable level of transparency with the US, sharing their targets, sources told CNN.
“We need ATACMS,” the Ukrainian official reiterated when asked what else, along with the Gray Eagle, is at the top of their wish list.
A $400 million US package for Ukraine announced earlier this month included another commitment of more than 1,000 unmanned Phoenix Ghost drones. Unlike the Gray Eagle, those are smaller, single-use suicide drones.
Since Russia invaded Ukraine in late March, the Biden administration has supported Ukraine with increasingly advanced weapons. Pushing, while trying not to cross, a line that they believe Russia would see as overly escalatory.
Last week, President Joe Biden reiterated his team’s concerns, telling reporters at a news conference: “I’m not looking for [Ukraine] to start bombing Russian territory.”
Biden highlighted the fact that while the US has given Ukraine the highly-effective HIMARS mobile rocket systems, they have not been offered the longer-range munitions that go with those systems, which includes ATACMS.
'I'm not looking for conflict': Biden discusses three-hour meeting with Xi
Nor have fighter jets been sent to Ukraine by any NATO country, perhaps the most hotly debated part of any discussion over what weapons should be given to Ukraine.
They are still being considered, three people familiar with the discussions say. Whether that means US warplanes or Soviet-origin fighters like the Mig-29 is a key part of the conversation. The US could ask a country like Poland to give Ukraine Mig-29s and backfill Poland with American jets.
Sending American warplanes directly to Ukraine makes little sense, the congressional official said, since there is little air-to-air combat, Ukrainian pilots aren’t trained on them and they require significant maintenance.
Then there’s the question of how that would affect Russian President Vladimir Putin’s calculus amid fears he could use a nuclear weapon.
“Are we pouring escalatory measures that might be tolerated by Putin into a bucket that at some point overflows?” another person familiar with the discussions asked. “What level is in that bucket right now? And how much volume are you proposing adding to it? Those are things US intelligence and defense officials are trying constantly to figure out.”
Ukrainian officials are increasingly frustrated with the administration’s general fears of escalation, pointing out that they could already have used the HIMARS – the most advanced US system in Ukraine to date – to hit Russian territory, but haven’t.
“This is bullshit frankly, what kind of escalation?” the Ukrainian official asked. “They drop a nuclear bomb, or what we are afraid of? This I don’t understand.”

January 6 committee says Trump ‘failed to comply’ with subpoena
By Annie Grayer and Sara Murray, CNN
Published 8:07 PM EST, Mon November 14, 2022

 — 
The House select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, Capitol Hill insurrection said former President Donald Trump has “failed to comply” with its subpoena for documents and testimony.
“In the days ahead, the committee will evaluate next steps in the litigation and regarding the former President’s noncompliance,” Democratic Rep. Bennie Thompson and GOP Rep. Liz Cheney, who serve as chair and vice chair of the committee respectively, said in a statement.
The committee has previously held witnesses in contempt of Congress for defying the panel’s subpoenas but has little ability to force compliance with the subpoena quickly through the courts.
Trump sued the committee on November 11 as a way to challenge its subpoena according to filings in a federal court in Florida. His lawsuit sought to challenge both the legitimacy of the committee – which multiple courts have upheld – and claim he should be immune from testimony about the time he was president.
Thompson and Cheney said in their statement on Monday, “[Trump’s] attorneys have made no attempt to negotiate an appearance of any sort, and his lawsuit parades out many of the same arguments that courts have rejected repeatedly over the last year.”
Trump’s lawyers said in the court filings they’ve communicated with the House over the past week and a half as the subpoena deadlines neared, offering to consider answering written questions while expressing “concerns and objections” about the bulk of the document requests. After Trump missed his first deadline to produce documents on November 4, his team replied on November 9, according to court documents, saying that he wouldn’t testify and found no records to turn over related to personal communications.
“The truth is that Donald Trump, like several of his closest allies, is hiding from the Select Committee’s investigation and refusing to do what more than a thousand other witnesses have done,” Thompson and Cheney wrote. “Donald Trump orchestrated a scheme to overturn a presidential election and block the transfer of power. He is obligated to provide answers to the American people.”
The panel subpoenaed Trump on October 21 seeking documents by November 4 and testimony starting on November 14. When the former president did not turn over documents by the first deadline, Thompson accused Trump’s team of trying to delay, according to court documents.
“Given the timing and nature of your letter – without any acknowledgment that Mr. Trump will ultimately comply with the subpoena – your approach on his behalf appears to be a delay tactic,” Thompson wrote.
In Trump’s lawsuit, his attorneys argued, “the Subpoena’s request for testimony and documents from President Trump is an unwarranted intrusion upon the institution of the Presidency because there are other sources of the requested information, including the thousand-plus witnesses the Committee has contacted and one million documents that the Committee has collected.”
Trump said in the lawsuit that the House’s demands, if he met them, would violate privilege protections around the executive branch, including revealing conversations he had with Justice Department officials and members of Congress about the 2020 election and “pending governmental business.”
He also argued to the court that he shouldn’t have to reveal inner workings about his 2020 presidential campaign, “including his political beliefs, strategy, and fundraising. President Trump did not check his constitutional rights at the Oval Office door. Because the Committee’s Subpoena to President Trump infringes upon his First Amendment rights it is invalid.”
Trump’s attorney, David Warrington, said in a statement with the release of the lawsuit in part that “long-held precedent and practice maintain that separation of powers prohibits Congress from compelling a President to testify before it.”
Trump’s back-and-forth with the House followed by the lawsuit will make it much harder for the committee to enforce the subpoena – and the dispute essentially will be unresolvable before the current Congress expires in January.

London
King Charles III is celebrating his first birthday on the British throne with a new photograph and a new role as Ranger of Windsor Great Park.
Released on Monday, his 74th birthday, the photograph marks Charles' appointment as Ranger.
The photo shows the monarch leaning against an ancient oak tree in Windsor Great Park, with the winter sun gleaming in the background.

The post of Ranger was previously held by his father, Prince Philip, the late Duke of Edinburgh, for 70 years. Duties include offering guidance to the Deputy Ranger on the stewardship of one of the country's oldest estates, Buckingham Palace said in a statement.
Festivities for the King's birthday began Monday with a rendition of ""Happy Birthday"" by the band of the Household Cavalry at Buckingham Palace, where Charles was born in 1948. This performance was followed at midday by a 41-gun royal salute from the King's Troop Royal Horse Artillery in Green Park.
Charles came to the throne on September 8, with the death of his mother, Queen Elizabeth II, at age 96.
Last month, the UK Royal Mint unveiled King Charles III's coin portrait.

Clues at ancient lake site reveal earliest known cooked meal

 — 
Scientists have found the earliest known evidence of cooking at an archaeological site in Israel.
The shift from eating raw to cooked food was a dramatic turning point in human evolution, and the discovery has suggested prehistoric humans were able to deliberately make fires to cook food at least 780,000 years ago.
The detailed study of fish teeth unearthed at the Gesher Benot Ya’aqov site, situated on the edge of the ancient lake Hula, revealed that some of our early ancestors — most likely Homo erectus — were able to cook fish, said study author Dr. Irit Zohar, a researcher at Tel Aviv University’s Steinhardt Museum of Natural History.
The lakeside dwellers feasted on a large freshwater species, according to Zohar, who is also a curator of the Beit Margolin Biological Collections at Oranim Academic College.
No human remains had been found at the site, but the stone tools matched those found at Homo erectus sites across Africa, Zohar said. She said the lake would have been shallow, and it might have been easy to catch large fish like the extinct Luciobarbus longicep, which could grow up to 6.5 feet (2 meters), by hand.
“This is an incredibly important discovery,” said archaeological geochemist Dr. Bethan Linscott, who wasn’t involved in the study.
“Evidence for the controlled use of fire in the (early Stone Age) … is ephemeral at best, and as such, the evidence of anthropogenically (because of human activity) accumulated and cooked fish remains described here will undoubtedly have a wide impact on the research community,” said Linscott, who is a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Oxford in the United Kingdom.

The shift to eating cooked meals meant humans expended less energy on the intensive work of searching for and digesting fresh, raw food, freeing up more time in which to develop new social and behavioral systems.
“Diet has had a big impact on the evolution of our species. It has been suggested that the consumption of meat in particular contributed to the increase in relative brain size of our early Homo ancestors — but pathogenic bacteria make the consumption of uncooked meat a risky business,” Linscott said.
“Cooking, however, kills bacteria and increases the energetic value of meat — thereby creating a new, reliable food source for early hominins. Understanding when this happened is therefore a topic of great interest, because it might help to explain why our hominin ancestors evolved the way that they did.”
The research was published in the journal Nature Ecology and Evolution on Monday.
The Israeli research team includes: (from left) Dr. Irit Zohar, Dr. Marion Prévost, Professor Naama Goren-Inbar, Dr. Guy Sisma-Ventura, Professor Nira Alperson-Afil, Professor Israel Hershkovitz.

Does burning equal cooking?
Previous research by Zohar, who has worked at the site for 16 years, had found that the layers of sediment where stone tools were found — suggesting human occupation — were associated with a high number of fish teeth from two particular species (Luciobarbus longiceps and Carasobarbus canis) that were part of the carp family but now extinct.
There were, however, very few fish bones, which unlike teeth soften under high temperatures and easily decay. Other work by study coauthor Nira Alperson-Afil, professor in the department of Israel studies and archaeology at Bar-Ilan University, had identified traces of hearths — some of the earliest outside Africa.
Stone Age humans had unexpectedly advanced medical knowledge, new discovery suggests
To determine whether the prehistoric inhabitants of the site actually cooked fish there and didn’t just discard fish remains in a fire, the researchers identified changes in the size of tooth enamel crystals, which respond differently to changes in temperature.
In the experiments, Zohar and collaborator Dr. Jens Najorka, who is X-ray lab manager at the Natural History Museum in London, analyzed 56 teeth belonging to prehistoric and freshwater fish that allowed them to identify the changes caused by cooking at low versus high temperatures. The results suggested the fish were cooked at temperatures between 392 and 932 degrees Fahrenheit (200 and 500 degrees Celsius).
A 3D reconstruction of the skull from the fish species Luciobarbus longiceps shows the location of the teeth.

“We do not know exactly how the fish were cooked but given the lack of evidence of exposure to high temperatures, it is clear that they were not cooked directly in fire and were not thrown into a fire as waste or as material for burning,” Najorka said in a news release.
The team was also able to determine that fish were a regular part of the diet — they weren’t just a seasonal treat or a last resort when other sources of food were scarce. The researchers did this by looking at the geochemical composition of oxygen and carbon isotopes in the enamel of the teeth to figure out during which season the fish died. The results suggested that they were cooked and eaten year round.
Early migration
Homo erectus was the first hominin to migrate outside Africa, and the research suggested ancient Lake Hula might have been a key staging post on the route of these early migrations.
Exactly when humans first began cooking fish — or any other type of food — is unknown, and there’s no consensus on when ancient hominins first developed the ability to start fires and cook. Until this study, the earliest hard evidence of the use of fire to cook was by Neanderthals and Homo sapiens, who cooked starchy roots in what’s now South Africa about 170,000 years ago.
DNA analysis reveals first known Neanderthal family
The cumulative weight of the evidence put forward in the study suggested the fish was cooked, said John McNabb, a professor at the Centre for the Archaeology of Human Origins at the University of Southampton’s department of archaeology. He was not involved in the study.
“When and where deliberately set and controlled fire first appeared, and when we began to cook our food, are two of the really big questions that researchers into human origins have long sought answers for,” he said via email.
“Fire is not just about safety and protection. It prolongs the working day and provides a really important mechanism for social bonding — we literally built our societies around our fires. Cooking opens up new dietary opportunities and brings new food stuffs on-line, as well as increasing the nutritious potential of what we eat. Was cooking the reason Homo erectus was able to move into strange new territories.”

What to know about upcoming House leadership elections
By Clare Foran, Melanie Zanona and Annie Grayer, CNN
Published 1:31 PM EST, Mon November 14, 2022

CNN
 — 
A new Congress won’t be sworn in until January and control of the House has not yet been determined, but Republicans appear on track to recapture the chamber and the race to determine who will serve as the next speaker is underway.
House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy has officially declared his bid for the speakership, but is already facing headwinds from members of the hardline, pro-Trump House Freedom Caucus who are threatening to withhold their support as they hope to extract concessions.
On the Democratic side, Nancy Pelosi, the current House speaker, has not yet made clear what her next move will be. Speculation has intensified in Washington over her political future and whether she will run again for the top leadership spot for House Democrats or if she will instead decide to step aside as a new generation of potential leaders waits in the wings.
Timing for internal GOP leadership elections – and the speaker vote
The vote to elect the next speaker will take place in January at the start of the new Congress, but House Republicans will hold their internal leadership elections to pick a Speaker nominee this week.
Republicans are scheduled to hold a candidate forum on Monday evening, followed by leadership elections on Tuesday, November 15, according to a copy of the schedule shared with CNN.
The elections are conducted behind closed doors and are done via secret ballot. In the GOP’s internal leadership elections, McCarthy only needs a simple majority to win his party’s nomination for speaker. That is expected to happen, but McCarthy could still fall short of 218 votes – the magic number needed to win the speaker’s gavel in January.
During that speaker vote, McCarthy will have a higher hurdle to clear. The full House holds a vote on the floor for Speaker and to win, a candidate needs to win a majority of all members, which amounts to 218 votes if no member skips the vote or votes “present.”
When will Democrats hold their election?
House Democrats will hold their internal leadership elections later – the week after Thanksgiving.
House Democratic leadership elections have been announced for Wednesday, November 30. Voting will take place behind closed doors via secret ballot using an app.
To be elected to any position in Democratic leadership, a candidate needs to win a majority among those present and voting. If more than two candidates run and no one wins a majority, the candidate with the fewest votes after the first round of voting will be eliminated and voting will proceed to a second round. That process continues until one candidate wins a majority.
Whoever is elected for the top leadership spot in the House Democratic caucus would serve as their party’s Speaker nominee. But if Republicans have a majority, that nominee would be expected to fall short in the vote by the full House in the Speaker’s election in January and would be poised to become House Minority Leader instead.
The first election on November 30 will be for the next House Democratic Caucus Chair and whoever is elected to that role will administer the rest of the leadership elections.
Who to watch in GOP leadership elections
McCarthy has been working the phones locking down support from across the conference and has received former President Donald Trump’s endorsement. But even if he becomes his party’s speaker nominee, as is expected, he could still face a rocky road to securing the gavel.
Members of the pro-Trump House Freedom Caucus are threatening to withhold support for McCarthy’s speakership bid and have begun to lay out their list of demands, putting the California Republican’s path to securing 218 votes in peril if the party ultimately takes the House with a slim majority. Members of the caucus are emboldened by the likelihood of a narrow House GOP majority – which would make the margins for McCarthy’s vote math tight.
McCarthy and his team are confident he will ultimately get the votes to be speaker. And two would-be challengers, Reps. Jim Jordan and Steve Scalise, the current House GOP whip, have lined up behind his speakership bid.
But if enough members of the Freedom Caucus withhold their support, it could imperil his speaker bid or force him to make deals to weaken the speakership, something he has long resisted.
CNN reported Sunday that Rep. Andy Biggs of Arizona, a former chairman of the pro-Trump House Freedom Caucus, is considering mounting a long-shot challenge to McCarthy, according to GOP sources familiar with the matter. McCarthy’s team has been prepared for this possibility.
If a challenger does emerge, it would be more of a protest candidate than a serious one. But the House Freedom Caucus is hoping to show McCarthy during the internal GOP leadership elections that he doesn’t have the floor votes for speaker, in hopes of forcing him to the negotiating table.
Republican races besides leader of the party
Aside from the speaker’s race, Republicans’ underwhelming performance in the midterms has scrambled other leadership races.
The race for House GOP whip – a position that will only open up if Republicans win the majority – was already competitive, though Rep. Tom Emmer, who chairs the House GOP’s campaign arm, was seen as having the edge since he was likely to be rewarded if they had a strong night.
Now, Republicans say it could be tougher for Emmer to pull out a win.
Emmer told reporters Tuesday he still plans to run and that he doesn’t know if a smaller majority impacts his bid. But his pitch to members is similar to McCarthy’s, saying: “we delivered.”
Meanwhile, Rep. Jim Banks of Indiana, a Trump ally and the head of the conservative Republican Study Committee, also officially declared his candidacy for the whip’s position. And Rep. Drew Ferguson of Georgia, the current deputy whip, is also vying for the post, arguing that his experience on the whip’s team will be even more valuable in a slimmer majority, where the chief vote counting job will be crucial for governing.
Who to watch: Nancy Pelosi
What happens in Democratic leadership elections revolves around the key question of what Pelosi decides to do.
Pelosi was asked by CNN’s Dana Bash on “State of the Union” on Sunday whether she would make a decision on running for leadership before the party’s leadership elections.
“Of course. Well, you know that I’m not asking anybody – people are campaigning, and that’s a beautiful thing,” the California Democrat told Bash. “And I’m not asking anyone for anything. My members are asking me to consider doing that. But, again, let’s just get through the election.”
If Pelosi decides to run again for the top leadership spot for House Democrats, it will make clear that she is not yet ready to relinquish her role atop the House Democratic caucus. Pelosi, a towering figure in Democratic politics, commands widespread support among her members and is viewed as an effective leader within her party.
But if she runs again for leadership, such a move would also likely surprise, and even frustrate, many in Washington, including members of her own party, who have been anticipating that she might step aside for a new generation of leadership to take the reins.
If Pelosi does not run for the top leadership post, it would set the stage for a major shakeup in House Democratic leadership and mark the end of an era for Washington. The move would kick off a fight for her successor that could expose divisions within the party as other prominent members of the party look to move up the leadership ladder.
Pelosi’s future freezes much of the Democratic races
Until Pelosi makes her announcement, much of the rest of the field is expected to remain essentially frozen in place.
Currently, Maryland Rep. Steny Hoyer serves as the No. 2 House Democrat, in the role of House majority leader, and South Carolina Rep. Jim Clyburn serves in the role of House majority whip. Massachusetts Rep. Katherine Clark serves in the role of assistant Speaker and New York Rep. Hakeem Jeffries serves as House Democratic caucus chair.
As potential candidates for the higher rungs of House Democratic leadership wait to see what Pelosi does before publicly making moves, some Democrats vying for other positions in their party’s leadership have already announced their candidacy.
Democratic Rep. Joe Neguse of Colorado, who currently serves as the co-chair of the Democratic Policy and Communications Committee, has announced his run for caucus chair to replace Jeffries who is term limited.
The race to lead the party’s campaign arm, DCCC chair, is starting to take shape up after the current chair Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney of New York lost his reelection.
Democratic Rep. Tony Cardenas of California announced his race for the spot on Friday but others are being floated as well including Reps. Ami Bera and Sara Jacobs of California.

 what are you guys doing? What qualifications does Bezos have giving economic advice? How about letting your audience know he's not an actual economist, or better yet get a real economist on. Being a billionaire does not make one an expert.

Kevin McCarthy seeks to assuage House Republican concerns behind closed doors ahead of leadership election
By Melanie Zanona, Gabby Orr, Alex Rogers and Annie Grayer, CNN
Updated 9:44 PM EST, Mon November 14, 2022
CNN
 — 
House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy sought to assuage House Republican concerns at a closed-door meeting on Capitol Hill on Monday night, part of his campaign to lead the House GOP conference and possibly take the speakership in the next Congress.
The California Republican and House minority leader got a standing ovation in the conference’s first post-election meeting, according to a source familiar with the meeting. However, McCarthy also faced tough questions and complaints from his members who were disappointed in Republicans’ performance in this year’s midterms. While the GOP appears likely to win enough seats to flip control of the House, the margin is expected to be smaller than originally predicted.
GOP puts on a show of disunity as it edges toward House majority
“They don’t give out gavels in small, medium, and large – we have the majority and we have the gavels,” McCarthy said at the meeting, according to the source. CNN has not yet projected who will control the House in the next congress.
House Republicans will hold a closed-door vote on Tuesday. McCarthy will only need a simple majority to advance from Tuesday’s vote as the speaker nominee, but the vote on the House floor for speaker will come when the new House convenes in January, and McCarthy will need 218 votes at that time to win the speakership.
On Monday night, Rep. Andy Biggs of Arizona, a former chairman of the pro-Trump House Freedom Caucus, announced in an interview with Newsmax he was mounting a long-shot challenge to McCarthy during the House GOP’s internal leadership elections.
“I’m going to be nominated tomorrow to the position of Speaker of the House,” Biggs said on Newsmax. “We’ll see if we can get the job done and the votes. It’s going to be tough. Kevin has raised a lot of money and done a lot of things. But this is not just about Kevin. I think it’s about institutional direction and trajectory.”
One of McCarthy’s sharpest critics, Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida predicted McCarthy is far short of the threshold he will need to get the coveted post.
“What I can tell you as I stand here right now is that Kevin McCarthy does not have 218 votes to become speaker,” he said. “I don’t think he has 200.”
Trump encourages allies to back McCarthy
Former President Donald Trump has been privately encouraging allies to support McCarthy’s bid for House speaker, according to two sources familiar with the effort, believing that the California Republican will be an asset down the road should the former president find himself in a contested 2024 primary.
Trump reaffirmed his support for McCarthy’s leadership bid in an interview with Fox News last week and he has since been working the phones to persuade Republican allies to back him, particularly conservative members who remain skeptical of McCarthy.
What to know about upcoming House leadership elections
The news comes on the eve of Trump’s expected announcement for a third presidential campaign. The former president and the California Republican have spoken multiple times since the midterm elections, sources said, and McCarthy’s camp is hoping Trump’s endorsement will help win over some of the staunchest Trump supporters who have been critical of McCarthy.
Despite Trump’s pro-McCarthy campaign, it hasn’t fully broken through. Some of Trump’s staunchest allies have been all over conservative media attacking McCarthy. However, one notable Trump ally who will actually get to vote in the speaker’s race went on Steve Bannon’s podcast on Monday and expressed support for McCarthy: Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, who called it a “bad strategy” and “risky” to challenge McCarthy given their likely razor-thin majority.
McCarthy has worked hard to court Greene, from having weekly meetings with her in his office to promising her better committee assignments after Democrats kicked her off committees for incendiary remarks.
Meanwhile, Trump aides and allies have been privately critical of Minnesota Rep. Tom Emmer, head of the National Republican Congressional Committee, amid the GOP’s underwhelming midterm gains, especially on the House side. CNN has not yet projected which party will control the lower chamber, though Republicans appear on track to gain a narrow House majority. Emmer is competing against Rep. Jim Banks, an ally of Donald Trump Jr., for the position of House GOP whip.
Trump is on the defense as he prepares for expected 2024 announcement
“The strategy is to protect McCarthy from blame because [Trump] needs him for his presidential run,” said one Trump adviser.
Trump has been eager to lock up public support from Republicans for his third presidential bid, with a separate GOP source saying he has been asking to see which GOP lawmakers have endorsed him in the media. So far, House GOP Conference Chair Elise Stefanik has been the highest-ranking Republican to officially back Trump’s 2024 bid.
Trump’s support for McCarthy stands in contrast with his relationship to Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. GOP sources told CNN last week that Trump is calling up his allies in the Senate to gin up opposition to the Kentucky Republican ahead of leadership elections in that chamber Wednesday.
A small, but vocal, group of GOP senators has been calling to delay their leadership elections so they can have a “family discussion” about why the GOP underperformed. And at least one Republican, Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, has publicly vowed to oppose McConnell’s bid for GOP leader.
McConnell has been calling his colleagues over the last several days to shore up his support as his team plans to plow forward with leadership elections on Wednesday. They are planning to have a GOP air-clearing session on Tuesday.
House Freedom Caucus’ influence looms
Several members of the Freedom Caucus met with McCarthy in his office Monday as they seek to extract concessions from him in exchange for their speaker votes.
Pennsylvania Republican Rep. Scott Perry said that while McCarthy has been willing to hear them out, he doesn’t see McCarthy cutting any deals until after Tuesday, when Perry is “99% confident” that someone will challenge McCarthy to show him he doesn’t have the 218 votes he would need on the House floor in January.
“I don’t think anything’s gonna really change between now and then,” Perry told CNN, leaving the meeting in McCarthy’s office.
While Democrats may have bucked the national trend, Republicans still hold a large sway in GOP-led states
Rep. Bob Good, who said McCarthy faces “an uphill climb” to the speakership, said they’ve asked McCarthy to bring to them his proposal for running the House.
Good later said he would back Biggs’ run.
“I’m voting for Mr. Biggs tomorrow,” he said. “The country needs transformational change. And that’s gotta start with changing how Congress operates, how the Republican Party operates.”
Perry said that while their primary focus has been seeking rules changes that would empower individual members – and weaken the speaker – that is “not the limit” of their issues.
“We want to see this place change dramatically, to reflect the will of the people and to acknowledge how broken it is,” he said. “It’s incumbent upon anybody that wants to lead to kind of lay out their vision and how they would change their portion of it.”
This story and headline have been updated with additional developments Monday.

Banksy confirms seven new murals in Ukraine
Published 14th November 2022

Three days after Banksy debuted his latest mural on Instagram, spray painted on the wall of a bombed building in the city of Borodianka, Ukraine, the anonymous street artist confirmed that he completed seven new works in Ukraine in total.
Banksy confirmed the news to The Art Newspaper after a series of murals suspected to be his appeared in the liberated Ukrainian city, which is located about 35 miles northwest of Kyiv. Other works are located in the capital and other cities in the region.
Borodianka, which was hit particularly hard by Russian airstrikes in the first few weeks of the conflict, was the first site in Ukraine where Banksy confirmed new street art. Credit: Ed Ram/Getty Images
The first artwork to be identified, which went viral over the weekend, shows a female gymnast balancing on a pile of rubble on the side of a building damaged by Russian strikes.
The graffiti artist posted three images of the piece Friday on social media, with a simple caption reading ""Borodyanka, Ukraine"" — an alternative spelling for the town's name.

Another artwork depicts a little boy, wearing a martial arts uniform tied with a black belt, flipping a grown man onto his back. Some have connected the image to Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose honorary black belt was revoked earlier this year by World Taekwondo, though Banksy has not publicly commented on the image or its meaning.
Other murals showed two children using a metal tank trap as a seesaw, and a woman in hair curlers and a gas mask holding a fire extinguisher.

Borodianka was hit particularly hard by Russian airstrikes and shelling in the early days of the country's invasion of Ukraine, with many buildings reduced to piles of rubble by long-range attacks. It was home to 13,000 people before the war, but most fled after Russia's invasion. What was left of the city was then occupied by Russian forces, who moved in on February 28.

The town came back into Ukrainian control on April 1, and returning residents found their houses ransacked and shops pillaged with windows broken and contents stolen. It has since been the focus of reconstruction efforts, with several tower blocks demolished as a result of damage caused by the fighting.
The series is the first set of Banksy artworks to pop up since last summer's ""Great British Spraycation,"" which saw the enigmatic artist leave behind his signature pop art commentary at sites across a number of British coastal towns.
Internet speculation grew before the artworks were confirmed. Credit: Ed Ram/Getty Images
Last year, the artist also focused his efforts on raising money for social and political causes, auctioning a painting for a record-breaking $23.1 million for UK healthcare organizations, and selling t-shirts in support of anti-racist protestors arrested for toppling a statue of slave trader Edward Colston in Bristol. (The protesters were cleared of charges in January.)
After confirming his authorship of the gymnast mural, many Ukrainians and supporters of the country in the face of its invasion thanked the artist in social media comments and posts.
Why this Chinese artist is outselling Van Gogh
""This is such a historic moment for our country, that people like Banksy and other famous figures are coming here and showing the world what Russia has done to us,"" a Kyiv resident told Al Jazeera English in a video posted to Twitter on Sunday.
CNN's Teele Rabane contributed to this report.

Margot Robbie says her ‘Pirates of the Caribbean’ spinoff isn’t happening
By Scottie Andrew, CNN
Published 2:02 PM EST, Mon November 14, 2022
Margot Robbie isn't playing a pirate for now. Her planned ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" spinoff starring a crew of women pirates has been canceled by Disney, she told Vanity Fair.

CNN
 — 
It’s not a pirate’s life for Margot Robbie after all. The Oscar nominee said the “Pirates of the Caribbean” spinoff in which she was set to star has been canceled.
Robbie said work had stopped on the planned “Pirates” film because Disney didn’t want to move forward with it, according to her Vanity Fair cover story. She’d been working on the film with writer Christina Hodson, who penned the script for Robbie’s Harley Quinn flick, “Birds of Prey.”
“We had an idea and we were developing it for a while, ages ago, to have more of a female-led – not totally female-led, but just a different kind of story – which we thought would’ve been really cool, but I guess they don’t want to do it,” Robbie said, referring to Disney.
Robbie and Hodson were first attached to the project in June 2020, one of two planned “Pirates” films, the Hollywood Reporter said at the time. The film series’ producer Jerry Bruckheimer confirmed Robbie’s involvement as recently as May of this year.
The original “Pirates” film series was loosely inspired by the Disney theme park ride of the same name and starred Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow. Depp starred in all five, with Keira Knightley, Orlando Bloom and Geoffrey Rush in supporting roles. The films grossed more than $4.52 billion worldwide, per CNBC, making it one of the most successful film franchises of all time.
But reviews got progressively colder as the series went on, and as Depp’s public reputation suffered, so did the potential for future films starring Sparrow.
A reboot of the series (separate from the canceled Robbie-starring spinoff) has been in development since 2019, with original series screenwriter Ted Elliott and HBO’s “Chernobyl” creator Craig Mazin. Bruckheimer told the Times this year that Depp would likely not star in future “Pirates” films, though the “future is yet to be decided.”
Robbie, meanwhile, is leading another studio tentpole: Next year’s highly anticipated “Barbie” adaptation, directed by Greta Gerwig. She’s also set to star in an “Ocean’s Eleven” prequel that will reportedly also star Ryan Gosling.

'Can we Google it?': CNN reporter checks local GOP official's voting claim in interview

New York
CNN Business
 — 
Google has agreed to a record $391.5 million settlement with 40 states for allegedly misleading consumers over its location tracking practices, a coalition of attorneys general announced Monday.
The attorneys general described it as the largest multi-state privacy settlement in US history.
The coalition, which included attorneys general from New York, Kentucky and Oregon, claimed Google had been misleading users about locating tracking in various ways since 2014. That included confusion around “the scope of the Location History setting” and “the extent to which consumers who use Google products and services could limit Google’s location tracking by adjusting their account and device settings,” according to a release from the office of Pennsylvania attorney general and governor-elect Josh Shapiro.
As part of the settlement, Google is required to be more transparent, including showing additional information whenever a location-related setting is turned on or off, making key location tracking policies clearly visible and giving users more details on the type of location data being collected and its use. Google will also now face limits on its usage and storage of some location information.
“Consistent with improvements we’ve made in recent years, we have settled this investigation which was based on outdated product policies that we changed years ago,” Google spokesperson José Castañeda told CNN Business.
The attorneys general opened an investigation into Google after a 2018 Associated Press report that the company “records your movements even when you explicitly tell it not to.” In a statement at the time, Google said it provides “clear descriptions of these tools, and robust controls so people can turn them on or off, and delete their histories at any time.”
The search engine faced a similar suit in January when four attorneys general from the District of Columbia, Texas, Indiana and Washington state claimed it had used “dark patterns” and deceptive practices to track users’ physical location even when those users have made efforts to block Google from doing so.
Location data like the kind collected by Google can be used to target advertising and build profiles on internet users. Google and other large tech companies have come under renewed scrutiny for their handling of location data in the wake of the overturn of Roe v. Wade. After facing pressure from lawmakers over how such data could be used to track abortion seekers, Google said it would start deleting user location history for visits to abortion clinics and fertility clinics, among other destinations.

President Joe Biden held a three-hour talk Monday with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping, their first in-person encounter since Biden took office and an opportunity that both sides appeared to hope would lead to an improvement in rapidly deteriorating relations.
Emerging afterward, Biden told reporters he was “open and candid” with Xi about the range of matters where Beijing and Washington disagree. He cast doubt on an imminent invasion of self-governing Taiwan, and seemed hopeful his message about avoiding all-out conflict was received.
Still, the US president was frank that he and Xi came nowhere near resolving the litany of issues that have helped drive the US-China relationship to its lowest point in decades.
“I’m not suggesting this is kumbaya,” Biden said at a news conference, “but I do not believe there’s a need for concern, as one of you raised a legitimate question, a new Cold War.”
Biden entered Monday’s talks hoping for an opportunity to take stock with Xi of the world’s most important bilateral relationship. He described Xi as not overly confrontational but instead “the way he’s always been: direct and straightforward.”
Biden's past promises for US to defend Taiwan under microscope in meeting with China's Xi
“He was clear, and I was clear that we will defend American interests and values, promote universal human rights and stand up for the international order and work in lockstep with our allies and partners,” Biden said. “We’re going to compete vigorously but I’m not looking for conflict.”
In a sign both men arrived to meeting hoping to improve the souring relationship, Biden announced his Secretary of State Antony Blinken would visit China and said officials from each country would begin working together through issues. Formal talks on climate cooperation between the US and China are expected to resume as well as part of a broader set of agreements between Biden and Xi, two US officials tell CNN.
China previously halted talks – viewed by the Biden administration as a key area where the two nations must work together – as part of retaliation for the visit to Taiwan by Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi. The US and Chinese envoys for climate change are talking, but the Biden administration will see what China is prepared to do to make concrete progress, one of the US officials said.
US Climate Envoy John Kerry’s spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment on whether formal climate talks between the two countries were back on.
The White House said in a statement after the meeting that Biden raised concerns about human rights and China’s provocations around Taiwan. But they found at least one area of apparent agreement – that nuclear weapons cannot be used in Ukraine, where that nation is trying to fight off a Russian invasion.
“President Biden and President Xi reiterated their agreement that a nuclear war should never be fought and can never be won,” a White House readout said, referring to the threat of nuclear weapons use in Ukraine.
Biden did underscore areas of potential cooperation with Xi, including on climate change, in talks that stretched past their expected time at a luxury hotel in Bali.
And he sought to convince Xi that a nuclear armed North Korea was not in China’s interests – particularly because further nuclear or long-range missile tests by Pyongyang could prompt Biden to scale up American military presence in the region.
“It’s difficult to determine whether or not China has the capacity” to convince Kim Jong Un to back off his tests, Biden said. “I’m confident China is not looking for North Korea to engage in further escalatory means.”
‘Good to see you’
The meeting began in the later afternoon with Biden and Xi walking toward each other from opposite sides of a hotel lobby, shaking hands in front of a row of US and Chinese flags. They smiled for cameras and Xi – through a translator – appeared to say, “Good to see you.”
What's at stake for the world's top two economies as Biden and Xi meet
“As leaders of our two nations, we share responsibility, in my view, to show that China and the United States can manage our differences, prevent competition from becoming anything ever nearing conflict and to find ways to work together on urgent global issues that require our mutual cooperation,” Biden said as the talks got underway.
“The world expects, I believe, China and the United States to play key roles in addressing global challenges,” he said.
Speaking second, Xi seemed to offer what could be interpreted as a pointed message to his counterpart, who has spent more than half-a-century on the world stage.
“A statesman should think about and know where to lead his country,” Xi said through a translator. “He should also think about and know how to get along with other countries and the wider world.”
The two leaders’ talks Monday could have consequences stretching months or even years as the world’s largest economies veer toward increasingly hostile relations.
The moments spent together on the sidelines of the Group of 20 summit here will amount to only a fraction of the time the two men have been in each other’s company since 2011. Biden has claimed that as vice president, he spent north of 70 hours with Xi and traveled 17,000 miles with him across China and the United States – both exaggerations, but still reflective of a relationship that is now perhaps the most important on the planet.

China warns US not to cross ‘red line’ over Taiwan
Xi stated that Taiwan is the “first red line” that “must not be crossed” in China-US relations, according to a Chinese foreign ministry readout.
Referring to the “Taiwan question” as the “very core of China’s core interests” and “the bedrock of the political foundation” of China-US relations, Xi stated that peace and stability across the Taiwan strait and “Taiwan independence” is “as irreconcilable as water and fire.”
China’s ruling Communist Party has long claimed the self-ruled democracy of 24 million as an inseparable part of its territory, despite having never ruled over it, and has pledged to take it back – by force if necessary.

In the meeting, Xi stated that basic norms of international relations and the three Sino-US joint communiques – which touches on the Taiwan issue – are the “most important guardrail and safety net” for bilateral relations and are “vitally important” for the two sides to “manage differences and disagreements and prevent confrontation and conflict.”
“We hope that the US side will match its words with action and abide by the one-China policy and the three joint communiques. President Biden has said on many occasions that the US does not support ‘Taiwan independence’ and has no intention to use Taiwan as a tool to seek advantages in competition with China or to contain China. We hope that the US side will act on this assurance to real effect,” according to the readout.
Xi also defended China’s human rights records and governance system, saying that China has “Chinese-style democracy” that fits its national conditions, according to the readout. He acknowledged the differences between China and the US, but stressed that they should not become “an obstacle to growing China-US relations.”
“The Chinese nation has the proud tradition of standing up for itself. Suppression and containment will only strengthen the will and boost the morale of the Chinese people,” the readout said.
A meeting long in the making
The meeting Monday took place at a remarkably low moment in US-China ties. Biden hoped coming face-to-face again after nearly two years communicating only by phone and video-conference can yield a more strategically valuable result, even if he entered the talks with little expectation they would produce anything concrete.
Relations have deteriorated rapidly amid economic disputes and an increasingly militarized standoff over Taiwan. The tensions have led to a decline in cooperation on areas where the two countries once shared common interests, like combating climate change and containing North Korea’s nuclear program.
Biden and Xi return to the table with high stakes -- and low expectations
In a national security strategy document released last month, Biden for the first time identified China as posing “America’s most consequential geopolitical challenge,” and wrote the country was the “only competitor with both the intent to reshape the international order and, increasingly, the economic, diplomatic, military, and technological power to advance that objective.”
There was almost no expectation among American officials that any of those issues could be resolved simply by getting Biden and Xi in the same room. Just arranging the meeting itself required US and Chinese officials to establish lines of communication after Beijing furiously cut off most channels following House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan over the summer.
“Every matter associated with this meeting, from phone calls to logistics, has been very carefully considered, negotiated, and engaged between the two sides,” a senior US administration official said.
Planning for Monday’s meeting predated Pelosi’s trip, and discussions continued between US and Chinese officials despite Beijing’s furor. The process was “serious, very sustained and professional in the best traditions of US-China diplomacy,” the official said.
A second official acknowledged the talks setting up the meeting were not always friendly.
“I won’t say that the conversations weren’t contentious because obviously there’s lots of areas where we have differences and challenges,” the official said. “The dozens of hours we have spent talking to our Chinese counterparts has definitely surfaced many of those issues.”
For his part, Biden takes meetings like this “incredibly seriously” and reads extensively beforehand. In meetings with advisers, he runs through various scenarios for how the meeting might go.
“He goes through ‘if this happens, then should we handle it this way,’” the first official said. “He understands that this is, in many respects, the most important bilateral relationship. And it’s his responsibility to manage it well and he takes that very, very seriously.”
Officials said in Monday’s meeting they expected Biden’s senior-most advisers to accompany him as part of his official delegation. And they said they expected Xi to similarly surround himself with top aides, though the US team entered the meeting expecting to see some new faces on the Chinese side amid an ongoing transition inside Xi’s inner circle.
China's Xi is more powerful than ever. What does it mean for the world?
Biden and Xi entered the meeting with momentum
For Xi, the trip to Bali also marked one of his first journeys abroad since the onset of the Covid pandemic, which prompted the Chinese government to impose strict lock downs and draconian restrictions. Xi’s reemergence on the physical world stage also comes on the heels of China’s Communist Party Congress in Beijing, during which he secured a norm-breaking third term as its leader.
Even a week ago, most inside the White House were expecting Biden to enter the talks comparatively weakened by Democratic losses in the midterm elections. But better-than-expected results for Democrats left the president feeling as if he was entering his meetings this week with the wind at his back, according to top aides.
“I know I’m coming in stronger, but I don’t need that,” Biden said of his own improved political fortunes on Saturday.
US officials previewing the meeting have stressed the Biden administration is not looking to come out of it with specific “deliverables,” including a joint statement listing areas of potential cooperation. Rather, the setting is aimed at offering both Biden and Xi a significant opportunity to better share their respective countries’ goals and perspectives.
“Xi is not an enigma to President Biden,” a senior administration official told CNN. “He knows him. And he is mindful of where Xi is trying to take China. He sees China as a competitor, and he feels confident the US can win that competition.”
China’s pandemic-era isolation, US officials say, had made it relatively harder in recent years to get a read on Beijing’s intentions abroad as Xi declined to travel outside of China – but they believe that is all about to change.
“We can expect them to be more assertive on the world stage,” the senior administration said. But, they added: “What that looks like is difficult to know right now.”
Sullivan said this week that finally substituting the pandemic-era video calls with a face-to-face meeting for the first time since Biden took office “takes the conversation to a different level strategically and allows the leaders to explore in deeper detail what each of them see in terms of their intentions and priorities.”

Trump tells Mar-a-Lago special master that he got to decide which White House documents were his to keep
By Katelyn Polantz and Tierney Sneed, CNN
Updated 12:52 PM EST, Mon November 14, 2022

 — 
Former President Donald Trump argued in a newly public court filing that a president gets to decide whether records from his White House are personal documents – and that he had decided that all the records he took to Mar-a-Lago were in fact his personal property.
The argument is Trump’s latest legal bid to hold off parts of the criminal investigation into sensitive records kept at his Florida resort and home after he left the White House.
The Justice Department responded by saying that Trump’s legal theory for when he can deem records from his White House as personal is wrong.

“Plaintiff may not designate records qualifying as ‘Presidential Records’ under the Presidential Record Act … as his ‘personal’ records simply by saying so,” the department said, adding that such a theory would “nullify” the purpose of the law.
The assertions came in dueling “global issues” briefs that Trump and DOJ filed last week under seal to lay out their big picture arguments about how special master Raymond Dearie, a senior judge in Brooklyn, should approach his review of the materials the FBI seized from Trump’s Florida home in August.
US District Judge Aileen Cannon – who appointed Dearie to conduct a third-party review of what documents should be withheld from investigators because of privilege issues – unsealed a redacted version of the briefs on Monday.
The Justice Department told the special master that prosecutors should be allowed to use nearly 2,800 documents in its criminal probe while the remaining privilege disputes are hashed out.
That would mean criminal investigators could get access to most of the documents taken from the former president’s Florida resort that are still in dispute, while privilege issues are resolved over one document Trump claims is covered by attorney-client privilege and more than 121 documents he says are shielded by executive privilege, according to the new DOJ filing.
Trump has sought to categorize “several hundred” seized records as his personal records, the Justice Department said. While attacking his logic for doing so, the department also argued that even if the records are personal, they should not be withheld from the federal criminal investigation into alleged mishandling of materials from Trump’s White House found at Mar-a-Lago.
The former president argued that if the federal government disagreed with how Trump has designated the records as personal, it would have to sue him.
“Plaintiff was authorized to – and did in fact – designate the seized materials as personal records while he served as President,” Trump’s legal team wrote. “President Trump was still serving his term in office when the documents at issue were packed, transported, and delivered to his residence in Palm Beach, Florida. Thus, when he made a designation decision, he was President of the United States; his decision to retain certain records as personal is entitled to deference, and the records in question are thus presumptively personal.”
The special master’s review of the disputed documents – which amount to roughly 22,000 pages – does not encompass looking at documents from Mar-a-Lago that were marked as classified. Those are being looked at by intelligence authorities and criminal prosecutors.
Sparring over executive privilege
In addition to its rebuke of what Trump considers to be personal records, the department also countered assertions from Trump that if Dearie rejects Trump’s argument that a document is a personal record, the former president could then assert executive privilege over the document. “The Special Master should not indulge this type of gamesmanship,” the department wrote.
The department also pushed again that Trump be required to declare under oath whether the government accurately described what it took from Mar-a-Lago.
Exclusive: DOJ mulling potential special counsel if Trump runs in 2024
This would put the former president on the spot to back up public, out-of-court statements suggesting the FBI planted evidence in the search. Trump’s lawyers have resisted requests that he authenticate the government’s description of what it seized from his resort.
In the new filing, the department pointed to the previous move by Cannon to block a requirement for such a declaration. She did so at the time based on the principle that Trump had not had a chance to review the seized materials, DOJ noted.
“Now that Plaintiff has reviewed the seized materials and claimed the overwhelming majority of them to be his personal records, considerations of fairness, integrity, and evenhandedness require Plaintiff to do what the government has done – namely, verify the property inventory or correct it if he believes it to be in error,” prosecutors said.

New York Times: Amazon plans to lay off thousands of employees

 — 
Amazon is planning to lay off some 10,000 employees in corporate and technology jobs, the New York Times reported on Monday, citing anonymous sources with knowledge of the matter.
The job cuts could start as early as this week, and will likely include staff working on Amazon (AMZN) devices (such as its voice-assistant Alexa), as well as people in its retail and human resources divisions, according to the report. “The total number of layoffs remains fluid,” the report stated.
Amazon did not immediately respond to CNN Business’ request for comment Monday. CNN has not been able to independently confirm the report. The Wall Street Journal also reported Monday that Amazon is set to lay off thousands of workers, citing a person familiar with the matter.
Silicon Valley's greatest minds misread pandemic demand. Now their employees are paying for it.
The news would make Amazon the latest in a spate of tech companies that have announced significant layoffs in recent weeks, amid broader economic uncertainty and a sharp slowdown in the demand many tech giants saw during the pandemic that led them to quickly add staff. Last week, Facebook-parent Meta announced it is laying off 11,000 employees.
Earlier this month, Amazon said it was freezing corporate hiring “for the next few months,” citing economic uncertainty and “how many people we have hired” in recent years. Amazon rapidly grew its headcount as the pandemic shifted consumer habits and spending towards e-commerce. In its most-recent earnings report, however, Amazon forecast its revenue for the holiday quarter would be lighter than analysts had expected.
Shares in Amazon have fallen more than 40% in 2022 so far amid a broader market decline.
News of potential layoffs comes at a crucial time for the retail industry, ahead of the holiday shopping season. Despite recession fears and inflationary pressures, the National Retail Federation is predicting a 6% to 8% sales increase from last year during the holiday shopping months.
Last month, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos tweeted about the possibility of a looming recession, writing, “the probabilities in this economy tell you to batten down the hatches.” In an interview with CNN’s Chloe Melas on Saturday, Bezos said that advice was meant for business owners and consumers alike. “Take some risk off the table,” he said. “Just a little bit of risk reduction could make the difference.”

Feds end Ukraine-related foreign lobbying investigation into Rudy Giuliani without filing charges
By Kara Scannell, CNN
Updated 6:51 PM EST, Mon November 14, 2022

 — 
Federal prosecutors investigating Rudy Giuliani’s activities in Ukraine have closed their investigation after more than two years and said no criminal charges will be brought.
Prosecutors with the office of US Attorney for the Southern District of New York have been investigating Giuliani, the former personal attorney to former President Donald Trump, for possible violations of foreign lobbying laws since early 2019.
On Monday, they informed a judge overseeing the investigation that they were closing the case.
The notification came in a court filing with prosecutors asking the judge to terminate the special master who was appointed to oversee a review of documents obtained when the FBI executed a search warrant on the former New York City mayor’s home in April 2021.
“The Government writes to notify the Court that the grand jury investigation that led to the issuance of the above-referenced warrants has concluded, and that based on information currently available to the Government, criminal charges are not forthcoming,” prosecutors wrote.
A spokesman for the US attorney’s office declined to comment.
“It’s wonderful, long-expected news,” said Robert Costello, an attorney for Giuliani. “Unfortunately, Mayor Giuliani had to spend two and a half years to three years with this cloud over his head.”
Ted Goodman, a spokesperson and political adviser to Giuliani, said: “The mayor has been completely and totally vindicated. We hope this will help bring an end to the unwarranted attacks on the mayor - a man who is quite literally the most successful prosecutor of the most dangerous criminals over the past fifty years. I challenge someone to find a more successful crime fighter than Rudy Giuliani, a man who cleaned up city government and took down the mafia.”
The end of the investigation also closes a chapter from the Trump administration that involved two South Florida businessmen, shadow diplomacy efforts including a plot to oust the US ambassador to Ukraine, and an impeachment trial of the former president.
Prosecutors had examined whether Giuliani violated foreign lobbying laws by operating on behalf of Ukrainian officials when he sought the ouster of the then-US ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, while urging Ukraine to investigate Trump’s 2020 political rival, then-Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, and his son Hunter.
US law requires anyone lobbying on behalf of a foreign government or official to register and failing to do so is a violation.
Giuliani had claimed his activities in Ukraine were done in his capacity as a lawyer for Trump, and that he “never represented a Ukrainian national or official before the United States government.”
In April 2021, federal agents executed search warrants at Giuliani’s Manhattan apartment and Park Avenue office, seizing 18 electronic devices. Prosecutors also disclosed that they had covertly searched Giuliani’s iCloud account in 2019. Earlier this year he met with prosecutors and provided passwords for some of the locked devices.
The green light for the search warrants – especially against a former president’s personal attorney – was one of the first high-profile moves by Attorney General Merrick Garland in the early days of the Biden administration.
Giuliani’s role as the then-president’s attorney and his involvement with Ukrainian officials added complexity to the investigation, people familiar with the matter told CNN. It wasn’t clear if Giuliani received any compensation from Ukrainians and he was publicly touting his efforts, which could make it more difficult for prosecutors to prove he was secretly lobbying for foreign actors.
Former Trump ally Tom Barrack and associate acquitted of foreign lobbying charges
Two South Florida businessman, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, helped introduce Giuliani to Ukrainians and translate for him on trips. Once viewed as potential witnesses in the government’s case, they became caught up in their own campaign finance and fraud scheme and have both been found guilty or pleaded guilty.
The decision to close the investigation also shows the challenges the Justice Department has faced when trying to enforce foreign lobbying laws, an area of increased focus because of the potential risks to national security.
Earlier this month, Trump ally Tom Barrack and his former assistant were acquitted of acting as undisclosed foreign agents for the United Arab Emirates.
The New York investigation isn’t the only legal threat Giuliani is facing. His actions trying to overturn the 2020 election results to favor Trump have drawn scrutiny and potentially costly fines or settlements. Dominion Voting Systems filed a billion-dollar defamation lawsuit against Giuliani for his unfounded election fraud claims.
Giuliani has been told he’s a target of the criminal investigation conducted by the special grand jury in Fulton County, Georgia, which is investigating Trump’s efforts to sway the election in his favor. He appeared before the grand jury in August.
Federal prosecutors are also conducting a wide-ranging investigation into efforts to interfere with the transfer of power from the Trump to Biden administration.

Tom Brady makes history as Tampa Bay Buccaneers win first-ever regular season game in Germany

 — 
Tom Brady has become well-accustomed at making history over his long and illustrious NFL career. And on Sunday, the 45-year-old set more historic marks from all the way across the globe.
Brady’s Tampa Bay Buccaneers beat the Seattle Seahawks 21-16 at the Allianz Arena in Germany, the NFL’s first regular season game in the country.
With the victory, Brady became the first quarterback to win an NFL game in three different countries outside of the US.
As a New England Patriot, Brady won all three of the international games he played in, with two in London and one in Mexico City.
And now, he can add Germany to the list as the NFL’s most decorated player adds another accolade to his ever-expanding collection.
After the victory, Brady described the atmosphere in the Allianz Arena – the home of German football giants, Bayern Munich – as “pretty electric.”

“It was a great atmosphere,” he told the NFL Network. “It felt like a pretty hyped up game when we came out for warm-ups.
“It was pretty electric so I hope the German fans got what they wanted. Great win by our team, we needed it. Played against a great opponent, our defense played great and I’m glad we found a way to slug it out and win.”
Despite a tough season prior to Sunday, Brady looked much more like himself, throwing a 31-yard touchdown pass to Julio Jones and with Leonard Fournette running for another as the Buccaneers raced into a 14-0 second lead.
With the Bucs up 14-3 in the third quarter, the team attempted to pull out all the stops as Fournette attempted to throw to Brady though Brady slipped and Fournette was intercepted by Tariq Woolen.
And when Chris Godwin caught a four-yard touchdown pass from Brady early in the fourth quarter, the result looked wrapped up with the score at 21-3.
However, a late comeback from the Seahawks meant the German fans went home with their fair share of excitement.
Tyler Lockett’s touchdown with just over eight minutes narrowed the gap and Brady’s untimely interception to Cody Barton was capitalized on by Seattle as Marquise Goodwin caught a touchdown pass from Seattle quarterback Geno Smith to reduce the deficit to just five with under four minutes to play.
Smith finished the afternoon with 275 passing yards and two touchdown passes.

But, just when they needed it, Tampa Bay produced a time-killing drive to kill the game off behind the running ability of Rachaad White – who ran for a career-high 105 yards – and secure the team’s fifth victory of the season and second in a row.
The Bucs now head into their bye week atop the NFC South and looking much more like the team that was predicted to vie for a Super Bowl ring.
For the Seahawks, after a promising start to the season, they fall to 6-4, but head back to the West coast of the US with their heads held high after showing resolve late on.

Congress returns for lame duck with long to-do list
By Daniella Diaz, Ted Barrett and Clare Foran, CNN
Updated 7:49 AM EST, Mon November 14, 2022
The Capitol is seen early Monday, November 14.
J. Scott Applewhite/AP
CNN
 — 
Lawmakers are set to return on Monday after being away for several weeks campaigning for the crucial midterm elections.
They face a jam-packed legislative to-do list before the new congressional session begins in January.
With that in mind, Democratic leaders are eager to bring several bills to the floor for votes during the lame duck session – the period after the midterms and before the new Congress begins.
The busy agenda includes: Funding the government to avert a shutdown before the end of the calendar year, passage of the National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, the annual must-pass legislation that sets the policy agenda and authorizes funding for the Department of Defense, a vote in the Senate to protect same-sex marriage and possible consideration of other key issues.
While Democrats may have bucked the national trend, Republicans still hold a large sway in GOP-led states
While the House is able to pass legislation by a simple majority, Democrats in the Senate face an uphill climb given their narrow majority. With a 50-50 partisan split in the Senate, Democrats lack the votes to overcome the filibuster’s 60-vote threshold – and do not have enough support within their party to abolish the filibuster, as many are anxious to do. Therefore, major priorities for liberal voters – like the passage of legislation protecting access to abortion after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade – are expected to remain out of reach for the party for the foreseeable future.
Democrats, who currently control both chambers, are returning with a new reality in the wake of Tuesday’s election they did not expect: Key races that will determine the balance of power in the House have not been called, and CNN has not yet projected who would control the House. While Republicans still appear likely to win enough seats to control the chamber, it would likely be with a narrower margin than originally anticipated.
On Saturday, CNN projected that Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada will win reelection, meaning the Democrats will continue to control the Senate once the news session of Congress starts in January. But with a runoff election set for Georgia’s US Senate seat set for December 6, the final make-up of the chamber won’t be known until at least then.
At a news conference Sunday, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer warned of a busy lame-duck session, promising “heavy work” and “long hours,” though he declined to get into specifics, saying he first needs to talk to his caucus about their agenda.
Funding the government
Congress passed a short-term funding bill in September that is set to expire December 16, making funding the government the number one priority for Congress when they return from recess.
Takeaways from a grim weekend for Republicans in the election that won't end
Because the legislation must be passed, it could attract additional measures that Democrats want to clear during the lame duck session. For example, additional financial support for Ukraine as it continues to defend itself against Russia. While that funding has bipartisan support, some conservatives – such as Rep. Kevin McCarthy of California, the top House Republican who is expected to become speaker if his party eventually wins the chamber – are balking at the pricey contributions and are vowing to scrutinize more closely additional requests from the Biden administration, a dynamic that is dividing Republicans.
Democrats also want more funding for the Covid-19 pandemic, but Republicans are not likely to support that request. Democrats may also seeking more money for the Department of Justice investigation into the January 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol.
Congress also has to pass the defense bill. Consideration of the wide-ranging bill could spark debate and a push for amendments over a variety of topics, including whether to punish Saudi Arabia for its recent decision to cut oil production.
Senate Democrats will also continue confirming judges to the federal bench nominated by President Joe Biden, a key priority for the party.
Same-sex marriage vote in the Senate
A Senate vote on codifying same-sex marriage is also on tap. In mid-September, the chamber punted on a vote until after the November midterm elections as negotiators asked for more time to lock down support – a move that could make it more likely the bill will ultimately pass the chamber.
The bipartisan group of senators working on the bill said in a statement at the time, “We’ve asked Leader Schumer for additional time and we appreciate he has agreed. We are confident that when our legislation comes to the Senate floor for a vote, we will have the bipartisan support to pass the bill.” The bill would need at least 10 Republican votes to overcome a filibuster.
Schumer has vowed to hold a vote on the bill, but the exact timing has not yet been locked in. Democrats have pushed for the vote after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, sparking fears that the court could take aim at same-sex or inter-racial marriage in the future.
Electoral Count Act
Votes are likely on bipartisan legislation that would make it harder to overturn a certified presidential election, a response to former President Donald Trump’s efforts to block the 2020 election results, which led to the siege of the Capitol. It is supported by Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican. If the bill passes the Senate, it would also need to clear the House, which in September, passed its own version of the legislation.
Debt limit
Meanwhile, it’s not yet clear when exactly the nation will run up against the debt limit and it appears unlikely for now that Congress will act to raise it during the lame-duck session, especially as other must-pass bills compete for floor time. But political battle lines are already being drawn and maneuvering is underway in Washington over the contentious and high-stakes issue. Democrats are insisting it would be irresponsible to cause a damaging default over paying for bills already accrued. While Republicans are digging in and insisting that they will only approve a debt limit hike if Democrats agree to cut spending moving forward.
Meet the history-makers of the 2022 midterm elections
At his news conference Sunday, Schumer vowed to “look at” the issue over the next few weeks, but said he needs to talk to the other members of leadership and see where the makeup of the House ultimately lands.
“The debt ceiling, of course, is something that we have to deal with. And it’s something that we will look at over the next few weeks,” Schumer said. “I have to talk to the leadership first. We don’t know where the House is going to be.”
Congress does not need to raise the nation’s borrowing limit until sometime next year, but there’s been some internal debate over whether Democrats should try to raise before the end of this year, especially if Republicans wind up in control of the House.
McCarthy thrust the issue to the forefront with comments last month that echoed those of several colleagues.
“If people want to make a debt ceiling (for a longer period of time), just like anything else, there comes a point in time where, OK, we’ll provide you more money, but you got to change your current behavior,” he said in an interview with Punchbowl News.
Minnesota Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar summed up the busy work period ahead in an interview with “CNN This Morning” on Thursday.
“In Washington, we have a bunch of things on our plate, including getting the defense bill done with Ukraine right before us and the strides that (Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky) is making against Vladimir Putin,” she said. “On our plate is the end-of-the-year budget bill to make sure we get that right, As you know the Electoral Count Act, an effort that I’m leading with (Maine Republican Sen.) Susan Collins and (West Virginia Democratic Sen.) Joe Manchin and others, so we don’t have January 6 happen again. All of that is immediately when we get back.”

18 students, driver injured in Kentucky school bus crash, officials say
By Kiely Westhoff and Theresa Waldrop, CNN
Updated 4:47 PM EST, Mon November 14, 2022
The bus crashed early Monday in Magoffin County, Kentucky.
WKYT
CNN
 — 
All 18 students and a driver have “varying degrees of injuries” after their bus crashed in eastern Kentucky early Monday, a school official said.
No fatalities have been reported, Magoffin County School District Superintendent Chris Meadows said in a statement.
The students range from elementary to high school, according to the Kentucky Department of Education.

A county spokesman said earlier that the driver and 21 students were hospitalized, some with critical injuries. The error came about because the preliminary list of injured included duplicate names, Meadows said.
The injured were taken by helicopter or ambulance to hospitals, Meadows said.
The bus was the only vehicle in the crash, said Kentucky State Police spokesman Paul Blanton. The driver appeared unable to answer questions, he said.
The bus was east of Salyersville, the county seat, when it “left the roadway,” according to a spokesperson for the state education department.
The initial investigation indicates that it then went over an embankment, a Kentucky State Police spokesperson said at a news conference Monday afternoon.
The bus, which did not have seat belts, looked like it had rolled over and landed on its side, according to Meadows.
First responders needed to use rescue equipment, including ropes and Stokes baskets, to pull the children up the hill, said Magoffin County Fire Chief Paul Howard.
A few of the students had already climbed up the hill when he arrived, Howard said.
The stretch of road where the crash occurred is “an area that has been slated for the possibility of putting up a guardrail,” but water and sewer infrastructure under the road has complicated the process, Magoffin County Executive Judge Matt Wireman said.
Asked if they would review seat belt requirements for students on district school buses, Meadows said they would need to review state guidelines but, “when it comes to student safety, everything’s on the table.”
Multiple surrounding counties sent people to help the lone dispatcher who was on duty when a student called 911 to report the crash, Wireman said.
“We had the all-call that went out today and surrounding counties answered that call, and they came to help our children and I just can’t thank them enough,” he said.
Officials at the news conference did not have any updates on the medical conditions of the injured.

Subway is selling premade sandwiches in smart vending machines

Your next Subway order could come from a vending machine.
Subway reported strong third-quarter sales Monday and publicly unveiled its first Grab and Go “smart fridge” filled with premade sandwiches, snacks and drinks. The machine debuted in September at University of California San Diego, and the company plans to add more across North America in high-trafficked areas like other college campuses, airports and hospitals.
Subway is rolling out Grab & Go fridges that have pre-mad sandwiches.

Local franchises will prepare and deliver sandwiches to the refrigerators, which are equipped with artificial intelligence and “natural language processing” so customers can choose to order verbally and have a contactless experience. Initial reaction from customers has been “extremely positive,” Subway said in its release.
Subway is leaning into grab-and-go. In 2020 the company began selling premade sandwiches in regular fridges at retail locations like casinos, gas stations and airports. Subway said Monday that program has rolled out to 400 locations with “plans for continued growth in the coming year.”

“As more of our guests search for dining experiences to meet their ‘in-the-moment’ needs, the brand’s non-traditional locations and platforms can serve them wherever and whenever they are craving Subway,” said Taylor Bennett, vice president of non-traditional development at Subway, in a press release.
It’s just one of many recent new programs from Subway as the company is in the midst of remodeling its brand image and selection. Recently it unveiled the most extensive menu makeover in the company’s nearly 60-year history.
So far, the results have been positive: Sales at stores open at least a year rose 8.4% in the third quarter, the privately held company announced last month. For the previous 18 months, Subway said it had “record-setting sales” across its roughly 20,000 US locations, bolstered by a number of changes that include new sandwiches, soups and store remodels.
Subway attributed its recent success to its new “Subway Series” menu — which was streamlined to help speed up service — and an increase in digital orders.
It’s also seeing a rebound in sales in locations that have been hit hard by Covid-19. Sales for the first three quarters of this year at Subway’s “non-traditional” locations — like airports, colleges and hospitals — have increased sales by more than 20% thus “indicating a strong recovery in 2022 across channels impacted by the pandemic.”
The fridges could also fill the void left by Subway’s shrinking brick-and-mortar footprint. The number of locations has declined for the fifth year in a row to 20,746 according to its website.

Tyson’s financial chief apologized Monday for his arrest last weekend after he allegedly wandered into the wrong home and fell asleep in a bedroom.
“I’m embarrassed and I want to let you know that I take full responsibility for my actions,” John R. Tyson, the chief financial officer of Tyson Foods, said during a Monday earnings call with investors. He is the great-grandson of the meat processing company’s founder.
“I also want to apologize to our investors as I have to our employees,” Tyson said on the call. “This was an incident inconsistent with our company values as well as my personal values. I just wanted you guys to hear this directly from me and to know that I’m committed to making sure this never happens again.”
Tyson Foods (TSN) CEO Donnie King commented on the situation as well, saying that the company was taking the matter seriously through its “strong, robust corporate governance process” and that the company’s board is overseeing an independent “thorough review of this matter.”
Tyson Foods CFO arrested after entering wrong home, falling asleep
Tyson, 32, was arrested on the morning of November 6 in Fayetteville, Arkansas, and booked into the Washington County Jail at 2:23 a.m. He allegedly entered a home that wasn’t his and was found asleep on a bed by a woman who lived there, according to news reports. The woman called the police, who identified Tyson through his driver’s license.
According to a police report Tyson was charged with public intoxication and criminal trespass, and he was released the same day on bond.
Beyond Meat executive who allegedly bit a man's nose will leave the company
Tyson’s arrest and apology come after a recent public misconduct scandal by another high-profile senior executive at a food company.
Doug Ramsey, former chief operating officer at Beyond Meat, left the company last month shortly after being arrested for assault. Ramsey was arrested in September on charges of “terroristic threatening” and third-degree battery after he allegedly bit a man’s nose following an Arkansas college football game. Ramsey was released on an $11,000 bond the following day, according to court records.
Beyond Meat suspended Ramsey following the incident and he left the company in October.

‘I wish that more people knew more about him’: What we know about the UVA shooting victims
By Christina Zdanowicz, Caroll Alvarado and Eric Levenson, CNN
Updated 9:45 AM EST, Fri November 18, 2022
Devin Chandler, D'Sean Perry and Lavel Davis Jr. were killed on the University of Virginia main campus.
CNN
 — 
Devin Chandler was a gifted football player who was always smiling and trying to make sure those around him were happy, his former football coach Adam Sykes said in a statement.
Chandler was one of three football players from the University of Virginia who were killed in a shooting late Sunday as a bus returned to the school’s main campus in Charlottesville from a field trip, school officials said.
“(Chandler) was one of the happiest young men I ever had the privilege of knowing,” Sykes said. “He was always smiling, and you saw him with every kind of group in the school. He just wanted to make those around him as happy as he was.”
University of Virginia President Jim Ryan identified the three athletes killed as Chandler from Virginia Beach, Virginia, Lavel Davis Jr. from Ridgeville, South Carolina, and D’Sean Perry of Miami.
“This is an unimaginably sad day for our community,” said Ryan.
Two students were wounded in the shooting and were treated at UVA Medical Center, Ryan said. One has been released.
These are the stories of the victims.
Devin Chandler
from University of Virginia
Devin Chandler was not only a great football player, but a “big kid” who loved to smile, sing and dance, UVA head football coach Tony Elliott said at a press conference Tuesday.
“Devin was what you wanted in a young person that’s at this level but he was just a big kid,” Elliott said. “The thing I remember about him is he always brought a smile to my face, because he just was happy with where he was, comfortable in his skin, and had a very bubbly personality.”
Chandler, a junior, played as a wide receiver and kick returner for UVA and had transferred this offseason from the University of Wisconsin.
Chandler’s family moved to Arlington, Tennessee, before his high school freshman year, where he played as a wide receiver and defensive back for Arlington High School, according to Sykes, who was head football coach at the school.
“We knew from the moment we saw him he was a very gifted player with a lot of potential,” Sykes said.
Chandler was a player the team could always count on, Sykes said.
“Even during his junior year when his dad passed away in the middle of the season, he came to me and said, ‘Coach, I want to play this week. My dad would want me to play this week.’ That was his character: always thinking of others.”
D’Sean Perry
from University of Virginia
D’Sean Perry’s family members say they are devastated by the loss of their son, a statement said.
“He was a loving, giving, caring, God-fearing young man who was full of life and potential, and who made his family proud,” the statement said. “His positive impact was not only felt by our family, but also by the several communities that genuinely loved D’Sean, and that he was blessed to be a member of.”
Perry’s family appreciates the outpouring of love and support, according to the statement.
One of Perry’s friends was at the vigil that drew hundreds to the campus on Monday.
“He was an amazing studio artist. He loved anime, he loved to cook and was one of the most loyal people that you’d ever met,” said Zoe Tran, who told CNN affiliate WUSA that she met Perry during her first year on campus.
In between tears, Tran said she was grateful for Perry and his friendship.
“I wish that more people knew more about him,” Tran said. “He was very reserved, but I think it was because he saved all of his love for those who were close to him.”
Elliott said many people didn’t know about Perry’s artistic side.
Perry was “very, very artistic, and could draw, could shape pots with clay, loved music, very cultured and well-rounded,” Elliott said. “Just a great teammate and had a sense of humor that was one of a kind that only D’Sean could have.”
Perry was also known for his quick wit and his kind heart among the teachers and staff at Miami’s Gulliver Preparatory Academy, from which he graduated in 2019, the school’s president Cliff King said in a statement.
“D’Sean was an amazing soul that made his family and community proud,” head football coach Earl Sims said. “His high moral character and integrity spoke volumes about the young man he was becoming. His presence was rich and made every encounter worthwhile.”
Perry’s parents thanked the South Florida and Charlottesville communities for the support they’ve received “during this impossibly tragic time,” said their attorney Michael Haggard in a statement to CNN.
Perry, a junior, was a linebacker for Virginia who played in 15 games over the last three seasons. On Saturday against Pittsburgh, he tallied two tackles in the 37-7 loss.
Lavel Davis Jr.
from University of Virginia
Coach Elliott recruited Lavel Davis Jr. as a freshman and enjoyed seeing him grow.
“Big smile, lights up the room, and most people would say because he’s the tallest guy in the room but just his presence, he’s got a gentleness about him, but he’s passionate about what he believes in,” Elliott said.
As a 6-foot-7-inch receiver, Davis was the team’s primary deep threat, with 16 catches for 371 yards and two touchdowns on the year, good for a stellar 23.2 yards per catch. The junior was one of the top wide receivers for the Virginia Cavaliers this season.
As a freshman in 2020, he had 20 catches for 515 yards and five touchdowns – an average of 25.75 yards per catch, second-best in the country – but missed the 2021 season due to injury.
“The other thing that resonated was just how good of a teammate he was and how much he loved his teammates and would do anything for his teammates,” Elliott said.
In a May 2021 video on UVA Football’s Twitter, Davis said outside of class he enjoyed watching ’90s movies and reading Shakespeare plays and the Bible.
“Virginia is the perfect place for anybody who wants to work hard and be great,” he said. “At Virginia, it’s way bigger than football.”
A friend of the family created a GoFundMe campaign to help the family cover funeral expenses.
Two others shot
The two people injured in the shooting were identified by prosecutors as Marlee Morgan and Michael Hollins.
Hollins came off intubation and was moved out of the ICU, family friend Joe Gipson told CNN on Thursday.
“Mike is doing better today,” Gipson said. “He is in intermediate care and progressing positively. He will hopefully begin to take some steps today.”
Hollins is a junior and plays running back for the university’s football team.
He was recently able to speak for the first time since the shooting, his mother, Brenda Hollins, told ESPN.
As soon as clinicians removed his ventilator, his family heard him thank his doctor, she said.
His first question to his family followed. “Where’s D’Sean?”
Perry was Hollins’ best friend, his mother said.
“The room went silent, and so he knew,” his mother said. “It was like, a cry I never heard before in my life, it was so deep.”
CNN reached out to Morgan’s family but has not received a response.
One of the two people injured was discharged Tuesday from UVA Medical Center, according to UVA Health spokesperson Eric Swensen.
Correction: A previous version of this story incorrectly spelled the last name of UVA Health spokesperson Eric Swensen.
CNN’s Melissa Alonso, Matt Phillips, Amanda Musa and Michelle Watson contributed to this report.

Jay Leno is recovering from burn injuries following a gasoline fire, according to a statement from the hospital where he is getting treatment.
Aimee Bennett, a spokesperson at the Grossman Burn Center in Los Angeles, told CNN that Leno was in stable condition, being treated for “burns that he received to his face and hands from a gasoline accident in his garage over the weekend.”
“He is in good humor and is touched by all the inquiries into his condition and well wishes,” the statement said. “He wants to let everyone know he is doing well and is in ‘the best burn center in the United States.’”
CNN has reached out to representatives for Leno for comment.
Leno, an avid car collector, was working on one of his vehicles in his garage when it reportedly burst into flames.
“I got some serious burns from a gasoline fire. I am ok. Just need a week or two to get back on my feet,” the former “The Tonight Show” host told Variety.
Leno, 72, canceled an appearance at The Financial Brand Forum conference in Las Vegas on Sunday, according to a report by People, citing organizers.
“His family was not able to provide us very many details, but there was a very serious medical emergency that is preventing Jay from traveling,” an email to conference attendees and obtained by the publication stated. “All we know is that he is alive, so our prayers go out to him and his family tonight.”
The conference had billed Leno as a special opening night performer for attendees who purchased a gold pass for the event.
CNN has reached out to The Financial Brand for comment.

CNN Business
 — 
Amazon is planning to lay off some 10,000 employees in corporate and technology jobs, the New York Times reported on Monday, citing anonymous sources with knowledge of the matter.
The job cuts could start as early as this week, and will likely include staff working on Amazon (AMZN) devices (such as its voice-assistant Alexa), as well as people in its retail and human resources divisions, according to the report. “The total number of layoffs remains fluid,” the report stated.
Amazon did not immediately respond to CNN Business’ request for comment Monday. CNN has not been able to independently confirm the report. The Wall Street Journal also reported Monday that Amazon is set to lay off thousands of workers, citing a person familiar with the matter.
Silicon Valley's greatest minds misread pandemic demand. Now their employees are paying for it.
The news would make Amazon the latest in a spate of tech companies that have announced significant layoffs in recent weeks, amid broader economic uncertainty and a sharp slowdown in the demand many tech giants saw during the pandemic that led them to quickly add staff. Last week, Facebook-parent Meta announced it is laying off 11,000 employees.
Earlier this month, Amazon said it was freezing corporate hiring “for the next few months,” citing economic uncertainty and “how many people we have hired” in recent years. Amazon rapidly grew its headcount as the pandemic shifted consumer habits and spending towards e-commerce. In its most-recent earnings report, however, Amazon forecast its revenue for the holiday quarter would be lighter than analysts had expected.
Shares in Amazon have fallen more than 40% in 2022 so far amid a broader market decline.
News of potential layoffs comes at a crucial time for the retail industry, ahead of the holiday shopping season. Despite recession fears and inflationary pressures, the National Retail Federation is predicting a 6% to 8% sales increase from last year during the holiday shopping months.
Last month, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos tweeted about the possibility of a looming recession, writing, “the probabilities in this economy tell you to batten down the hatches.” In an interview with CNN’s Chloe Melas on Saturday, Bezos said that advice was meant for business owners and consumers alike. “Take some risk off the table,” he said. “Just a little bit of risk reduction could make the difference.”

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez says she feels in danger in current political environment
By Paul LeBlanc, CNN

CNN
 — 
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said that she “absolutely” has felt her life is in danger since joining Congress, with her head always “on a swivel” when she’s in public amid the nation’s charged political environment.
“It is a very real dynamic and very unfortunately and tragically we’ve seen political violence play out,” the New York Democrat told CNN’s Chris Wallace on “Who’s Talking to Chris Wallace?”
The New York Democrat said the deluge of threats against her means “when I wake up in the morning, I hesitate to walk my dog. It means when I come home, I have to ask my fiancé to come out to where my car is to walk me just from my car to my front door.”
“It means that there’s just – a general disposition where you kind of feel like there’s almost a static electricity around you,” she said.

More on the midterms
The recent attack on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s husband has touched off fresh concern about violence against lawmakers and their families. Federal law enforcement agencies have consistently warned about the increasing threat of politically motivated violence after January 6, 2021, raising specific concerns about the likelihood that online calls for violence result in real-world attacks.
Ocasio-Cortez’s progressive credentials have made her the ire of many congressional Republicans and their supporters. She told The New York Times this fall that her office struggles to keep up with “astronomical” amount of threats she receives each day.
Such an environment, Ocasio-Cortez told CNN, has influenced her approach to her work, pushing her to be “as robust and urgent as possible.”
“I don’t want to take the time I have for granted. I don’t know if I’m going to be there to see us achieve guaranteed health care in the United States. So I need to advocate it in a very fully throated way right now,” she said.
“Similar to a full path to citizenship for millions of people in this country. I just have to be out and say it and at least leave a roadmap should I not be there.”
Asked about the future of Democratic leadership in Congress, Ocasio-Cortez, speaking broadly, said, “I do believe we need to have not just generational shifts, but potentially substantive shifts as well.”
“I think that and I hope that what we’ve seen, whether people think it’s too left or too right, or up or down or whatever, it may be that we shift in a direction where the leadership of the Democratic Party is less reliant on large and corporate donors and sponsorship, because that does have a shaping effect of our legislative priorities,” she said.

 — 
The great bull run for tech stocks may finally be over.
It has been a brutal year for the leading companies of Silicon Valley. Apple’s (AAPL) stock is down about 16% in 2022 — and that makes it the “best” performer of the so-called FAANGs of Big Tech. Facebook owner Meta, Amazon (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) have all done far worse, with Meta plunging 66% this year.
Other titans of the Nasdaq, such as Microsoft (MSFT), chip giant Nvidia (NVDA) and Elon Musk’s Tesla (TSLA) have fallen between 25% and 45% in 2022 as well. (The Nasdaq itself is down nearly 30%.)
The tech sector has been a market leader for years, but there are growing concerns about the future. Recent earnings have not been great.
Economic downturn would hurt tech
Liz Young, head of investment strategy at SoFi, noted in a report late last week that tech earnings during the third quarter fell 1% from a year ago and that revisions for the fourth quarter have been cut by nearly 10% in recent weeks. It could get worse.
“With this being the first quarter of a meaningful tone change in earnings … I don’t think it will be the last one of margin pressure,” Young wrote. She added that “it’s becoming clear that we may at least see recessionary conditions in some sectors, even if they don’t bleed into all facets of the economy. Tech is one of those sectors.”
There are also legitimate questions about strategy shifts at some companies. Meta, for example, is going all in on augmented and virtual reality while Netflix is now embracing advertising after years of vowing it would not have ads on its platforms.
Broader worries about the economy and advertising spending are hurting the sector. Many of the tech giants have already announced layoffs, and there is speculation that there could be more job cuts coming.
Facebook parent company Meta will lay off 11,000 employees
Recession worries don’t bode well for consumer spending, which is bad for Amazon and Apple in particular. And the tech leaders all face tougher competition — in some cases from one another — but also from rivals around the globe.
With that in mind, this could be just the beginning of a tech bear market.
Todd Sohn, director and technical strategist at Strategas, noted in a report late last week that when tech stocks imploded in 2000 as the dot-com bubble burst, it wasn’t until after the 2008 financial crisis before tech resumed a role as a market leader.
Sohn said tech could be in for another long winter ahead, noting that it’s “reasonable to expect that tech could take a backseat over the next couple of years, while energy, industrials, etc. assume the same type of leadership role that they took after the tech bubble.”
Some pockets of opportunity
Still, some argue that tech will bounce back in 2023. But investors may need to look beyond the FAANGs, Microsoft, Nvidia, Tesla and other megacaps.
“Tech is not a monolith. We believe cybersecurity and robotics have the potential to buck the economic cycle given cybersecurity has moved from niche to necessity and robots are mission-critical in fighting supply chain challenges, labor shortages and inflation,” Jay Jacobs, US head of thematics and active equity ETFs, said in a report.
BlackRock (BLK), the owner of the popular iShares family of ETFs, recommends several of its own sector funds as a way to play these trends, including the iShares Cybersecurity and Tech (IHAK), iShares Robotics and Artificial Intelligence (IRBO), BlackRock (BLK) Future Tech, iShares Evolved U.S. Technolog (IETC)y and iShares Semiconductor ETFs.
Biden administration issues new cybersecurity requirements for rail operators
Shawn Cruz, head trading strategist at Charles Schwab (SCHW)-owned TD Ameritrade, said tech investors are flocking more to cybersecurity since it’s a must have for corporations, regardless of economic conditions, given high profile hacking incidents.
Cruz said that there are some parts of tech that are trading at more “frothy” valuations. But cybersecurity stocks such as Palo Alto Networks (PANW), as well as semiconductors, are more reasonable.
In other words, tech investors should be looking tor more boring parts of the sector, not assets like crypto that are more about hype than substance. Cruz said that winners in tech are not going to be those with the next great idea or app. It’s about providing a service that businesses will need even if the economy slides into a recession.

These climate activists protested during Biden’s speech and got kicked out of the COP27 summit

 — 
Four American climate activists have been kicked out of the COP27 UN climate talks in Egypt after protesting during US President Joe Biden’s speech on Friday.
The group briefly interrupted Biden’s speech with what they described as an indigenous war cry, then unfurled a banner which read “People vs Fossil Fuels.” While Biden appeared mostly unfazed by the protest – pausing for a short moment before resuming his address – the four activists faced consequences.
They told CNN they were barred by security from leaving the room after the speech ended, their summit passes were then taken away, and they were escorted out of the venue by UN security.

“The security said that we put people’s lives at risk because we stood up abruptly in the room with the President of the United States,” Jamie Wefald, one of the protesters, told CNN on Monday. The short protest was mostly silent and did not involve the four activists moving away from their seats.
“And I said I understand, but just to be clear, you guys knew we had no weapons because we have to go through a very extensive security to get into COP in general, and they said, ‘Well, no security is 100%.’ “
The UNFCCC, the UN body that is sponsoring the talks and is responsible for security in the venue, told CNN on Tuesday the four have been suspended for breaching the conference’s rules. A spokesperson for the UNFCCC said “media actions and publicity events” are only allowed in designated areas, and not inside the conference room.
CNN witnessed three of the activists being denied entry to the venue on Monday afternoon, with UN staff telling them they have been suspended. CNN has asked the White House for comment, but has not heard back.
The episode is just the latest example of the somewhat heavy-handed approach to protests the UN and the Egyptian government adopted at the conference held in the Red Sea resort town of Sharm el-Sheikh.

The annual conference has always been seen as the place where activists and members from civil society groups get to interact with government officials and observe negotiations firsthand.
Huge protests and loud calls for action have become part of the event over the years. When climate activists marched through the streets of Glasgow during the COP26 conference last November, it was one of the biggest protests the UK has ever seen. At COP25 in Madrid in 2019, tens of thousands of protesters filled the city center, just as they had the year before in the Polish city of Katowice, the host of COP24.
But at this year’s iteration of the summit, protesters have mostly been sidelined into spaces far away from the negotiations.
The biggest protest of the summit so was held inside the conference on Saturday, when a large group of people marched through the venue, demanding rich countries to pay the world’s most vulnerable countries for loss and damage caused by the climate crisis.
But most other protests have been so small they are almost hard to spot by anyone who doesn’t know they are happening.
Egypt faces criticism over crackdown on activists ahead of COP27 climate summit
A small group of activists has been staging protests around the venue in the past few days, holding up banners calling for plant-based diets as a solution to the climate crisis. On Monday, a group of young protesters from the Fridays for Future took photos at the conference, calling on G20 leaders to act on climate.
“It hurts to say this, but they don’t get attention. There’s so many actions that happen within the COP space that are meaningful – people whose communities, our communities, are affected are speaking about it, and they offer solutions to these problems but there’s no coverage at all,” said Big Wind, climate activist and a member of the Northern Arapaho Tribe.
A protester outside the COP27 venue advocates for veganism as a solution to the climate crisis.

Protests are rare – and mostly illegal – in Egypt and the Egyptian government said anyone wishing to protest during the summit can only do so in a special dedicated “protest zone” away from the main conference site.
To access the zone, people need to register, a requirement which may scare off activists fearing surveillance. Among the rules imposed by the Egyptian authorities on the protests is a ban on the use of “impersonated objects, such as satirical drawings of Heads of States, negotiators, individuals.”
“All the meetings that we had, I can only speak for myself, but they were really trying to instill fear in us, you know, it’s such a repressive state … but inside the [conference venue], that is supposed to be UN territory,” said Jacob Johns, another of the group of activists who had been suspended from the conference. “And so for the UN to be denying people free speech in that space that is supposed to be theirs is just, you know, a slap in the face. It’s hypocrisy.”

Jeff Bezos’ top tips for managing the economic downturn

CNN Business
 — 
Amazon founder Jeff Bezos recently warned consumers and businesses they should consider postponing large purchases in the coming months as the global economy contends with a downturn and faces a possible recession.
The business leader offered his starkest advice yet on a faltering economy in an exclusive sit-down interview with CNN’s Chloe Melas on Saturday at Bezos’ Washington, DC, home.
Exclusive: Jeff Bezos says he will give most of his money to charity
Bezos urged people to put off expenditures for big-ticket items such as new cars, televisions and appliances, noting that delaying big purchases is the surest way to keep some “dry powder” in the event of a prolonged economic downturn. Meanwhile, small businesses may want to avoid making large capital expenditures or acquisitions during this uncertain time, Bezos added.
If enough consumers follow through with Bezos’ advice, it could mean lower sales for Amazon, the e-commerce giant Bezos founded and that created the vast majority of the billionaire’s wealth.
The New York Times reported Monday that Amazon plans to slash its workforce, laying off 10,000 workers, the largest reduction in the company’s history. That’s in addition to a previously announced hiring freeze in its corporate workforce. The company is second only to Walmart in the number of people it employs in the United States.
Amazon (AMZN) said in October it expects sales for the final three months of the year to be significantly below Wall Street’s expectations. The weaker forecast came as rising inflation and looming recession fears weigh on consumer purchasing decisions as Americans focus more on travel and dining out and less on buying discretionary goods.
The company’s stock has fallen more than 40% as surging prices and changing customer behavior weigh on Amazon and the broader tech sector.
Bezos said the probability of economic conditions worsening makes it prudent to save some cash if it’s an option.
“Take some risk off the table,” he said. “Just a little bit of risk reduction could make the difference.”
Last month, Bezos tweeted a warning to his followers on Twitter, recommending that they “batten down the hatches.” The advice was meant for business owners and consumers alike, Bezos said in the interview.
Many may be feeling the pinch now, he added, but argued that as an optimist he believes the American Dream “is and will be even more attainable in the future” — projecting that within his own lifetime, space travel could become broadly accessible to the public.
Although the US economy is not, technically, in a recession, nearly 75% of likely voters in a recent CNN poll said they feel as though it is. Wages are up, but not enough to take the sting off inflation, most notably high prices of necessities like food, fuel and shelter. For those invested in stocks, it’s not been a great year, either, and that’s especially hard on retirees who are living off their investments.
Other business leaders have issued similar messages about the economy in recent months. Tesla (TSLA) and Twitter CEO Elon Musk last month admitted demand for Tesla (TSLA)s was “a little harder” to come by, and noted that Europe and China are experiencing a “recession of sorts.” Musk also warned that Tesla (TSLA) would fall short of its sales growth target.
JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon in October spooked the stock market by saying a recession could hit the United States in as little as six to nine months.

Daniel Craig unleashes his inner disco diva in Taika Waititi-directed vodka commercial
By Toyin Owoseje, CNN
Published 12:26 PM EST, Mon November 14, 2022
Daniel Craig stars in a new Belvedere Vodka commercial.

London
CNN
 — 
Since ending his 15-year run as James Bond with “No Time to Die” last year, Daniel Craig has not been sitting idle.
The British star has been busy brushing up his fancy footwork, which he enthusiastically showcases in a new vodka commercial directed by Oscar-winning filmmaker Taika Waititi.
Belvedere Presents Daniel Craig, Directed by Taika Waititi: Director’s Cut
In the tongue-in-cheek ad for Belvedere Vodka, which premiered last week and runs for more than two minutes, Craig goes from brooding and enigmatic to swaggerlicious and even … fun.
The ad opens with a white-suited Craig standing on a bridge, back to the camera, gazing moodily out at the water. The scene could be straight out of a 007 movie. But then it goes a little unexpected.
With a quick costume change, the 54-year-old sheds the secret agent and unleashes his inner disco diva, shimmying, thrusting and gyrating on the street and then around a hotel to a soundtrack by Rita Ora and Giggs.
The ad ends with Craig taking a drink of Belvedere and commenting “finally.” Dancing is thirsty work. after all.
In a postscript, Waititi makes an appearance as a caricature of himself as director – being fanned by an attendant as another feeds him sushi. “Let’s go again, just be yourself,” he tells Craig, who flashes a smile to reveal sparkling diamanté “DC” grills.
Judging by the mixed responses online, fans are both shaken and stirred.
In a first, Netflix's 'Knives Out' sequel will play in theaters for a week
One Twitter user branded it “the wildest thing I’ve ever seen,” adding she couldn’t believe it was Craig.
Another said: “The moral of that Belvedere vodka advert seems clear: ‘get drunk on this booze & you’ll embarrass yourself in public and Dad-dance in a way not even Daniel Craig can make look cool.’”
A third commentator wrote on YouTube: “Absolutely wonderful!!! Enjoyed seeing Daniel outside the suave, sophisticated ‘Bond’ persona. I so loved this.”
Craig can next be seen reprising his role as wacky detective Benoit Blanc in “Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery,” the sequel to Rian Johnson’s 2019 comedy-drama “Knives Out.”

‘Stranger Things’ creators tease Season 5
By Lisa Respers France, CNN
Published 10:56 AM EST, Mon November 14, 2022
Millie Bobby Brown as Eleven in ""Stranger Things.""
Netflix
CNN
 — 
It sounds like the end of “Stranger Things” might have viewers in their feelings.
The show’s creators, Matt and Ross Duffer, hinted at what’s to come on Sunday during a panel discussion in Los Angeles.
The Duffer brothers said they pitched the fifth and final season to Netflix over a two hour meeting, according to The Hollywood Reporter.
“We did get our executives to cry, which I felt was a good sign that these executives were crying,” Matt Duffer said. “The only other times I’ve seen them cry were like budget meetings.”
The panel for the wildly popular Netflix series was moderated by Patton Oswalt. In addition to the siblings, the conversation included executive producer Shawn Levy and several cast members.
Ross Duffer said the production was “full steam ahead” with the first script already having been turned in and work happening on the second.
He referenced the many characters on the show and the importance of wrapping up their storylines, something Levy also touched on.
“As a witness and having been in that two-hour pitch room and having read this first script — I’m paralyzed with fear that I’ll spoil anything but I will say the thing about these Duffer Brothers is that even though the show has gotten so famous and the characters have gotten so iconic and there’s so much about the ’80s and the supernatural and the genre, it’s about these people, it’s about these characters,” Levy said. “Season five is already so clearly taking care of these stories of the characters because that’s always been the lifeblood of ‘Stranger Things.’”

""Aviation's first responders are charged with the safety of everyone on board. When disruptions like this happen, it not only risks the safety of crew involved, it takes away from Flight Attendants' ability to respond to a medical, safety, or security emergency,"" Nelson said.

New records reveal foreign government spending at Trump’s Washington hotel
By Zachary Cohen, Jeremy Herb and Kara Scannell, CNN

 — 
The governments of six foreign countries, including Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, spent more than $700,000 at then-President Donald Trump’s Washington, DC, hotel over the first two years of his presidency, according to newly released accounting documents.
The new documents offer concrete evidence of the rare practice of foreign governments spending money directly with businesses owned by a sitting president, which Democrats on the House Oversight Committee say raise new questions about possible efforts to influence Trump through his companies while he was in the White House.
The hotel accounting records were obtained by the House Oversight Committee through Mazars, Trump’s former accounting firm, and provided to CNN. The committee, which has investigated Trump’s businesses and his lease of the DC property from the government, was provided the records following a years-long court battle that ended in a settlement in September.
While it’s been known that foreign delegations stayed at the hotel during Trump’s time in office, the documents – which include spending by China, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Turkey, Malaysia and the UAE – offer the first detailed accounting records of those stays.
Trump’s hotel, which he opened in 2016, became a magnet for Trump loyalists, Republicans and lobbyists hoping to gain access to Trump administration officials. The hotel has long been a source of criticism by Democrats, who accused Trump of violating the Constitution’s Emoluments Clause, which prohibits a president from receiving an “emolument,” or profit, from any “King, Prince, or foreign State” unless Congress consents.
The spending in the records included more than $250,000 by Malaysia, more than $280,000 by Qatar, more than $90,000 by the Saudis and more than $74,000 by the UAE. In addition, lobbyists and other businesses with connections to foreign governments spent tens of thousands more at Trump’s Washington property.
There’s no evidence that the foreign spending at Trump’s hotel, which the Trump Organization sold earlier this year, directly affected US policy. But many of the hotel stays coincided with significant foreign policy events, including meetings between Trump and other foreign leaders and US efforts to resolve the 2017 Middle Eastern blockade of Qatar.
The committee sent a letter Monday to the National Archives detailing portions of what was in the partially redacted accounting records and asking for additional presidential records related to Trump’s hotel and the foreign governments “to determine whether former President Trump distorted U.S. foreign policy to serve his own financial interests.”
“These documents sharply call into question the extent to which President Trump was guided by his personal financial interest while in office rather than the best interests of the American people,” House Oversight Chairwoman Carolyn Maloney said in a statement to CNN. “These documents, which the committee continues to obtain from Mazars, will inform our legislative efforts to ensure that future presidents do not abuse their position of power for personal gain.”
A spokesperson for the National Archives told CNN that they “are in receipt of the letter and will respond in accordance with the Presidential Records Act.”
The committee’s disclosure of Trump’s financial documents comes one day before Trump is set to hold a “special announcement” at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, where the former president is expected to launch another campaign for the White House in 2024. The former president’s foreign business dealings, as well as those of his immediate family members, have been under scrutiny for years, and that has persisted in the months since he left office.
The House Oversight Committee began receiving financial documents from Mazars in September after a deal was reached to end litigation over the documents. The committee first subpoenaed Mazars for Trump’s financial records related to his hotel in April 2019.
It’s not clear what other spending at Trump’s former Washington, DC, hotel from other governments is included in the documents provided to the committee, or how much of foreign spending contributed to the hotel’s overall revenues.
CNN reached out for comment to the embassies of the six countries included in the House Oversight documents.
In a statement to CNN, a Qatari government official disputed the committee’s findings, arguing that the charges listed in the newly released documents were private citizens and not part of the Qatari government.
A committee spokesperson, however, told CNN that “under the Trump Organization’s own internal policies, the stay at the Trump Hotel by members of Qatar’s ruling family would be identified as spending from a foreign government.”
In response to questions about the foreign spending, Eric Trump said in a statement to CNN: “As a company, we went to tremendous lengths to avoid even the appearance of a conflict of interest, not due to any legal requirement, but because of the respect we have towards the office of the Presidency. We walked away from billions of dollars in new deals, ceased all international expansion, engaged with an outside ethics adviser to review any material transactions and furthermore, have voluntarily donated all profits from foreign government patronage at our properties back to the United States Treasury on an annual basis.”
Trump Hotel spending during Qatar blockade crisis
After Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates imposed a blockade on their regional competitor Qatar in 2017, all three countries not only publicly lobbied Trump for his support in helping resolve the crisis, but also spent hundreds of thousands of dollars at the former president’s hotel, the documents provided to CNN show.
The documents obtained by the House Oversight Committee detail spending at Trump’s hotel by the governments of all three Gulf countries from late 2017 through mid-2018, including large payments to book rooms for senior foreign officials at a time when they were actively seeking the Trump administration’s support in the blockade crisis.
During that time, the crisis fueled tensions between then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who had been briefed by Saudi and UAE leaders about their governments’ plan to impose a blockade on Qatar one month before they did so.
Maloney specifically noted in her letter to the Archives that both Saudi Arabia and the UAE spent tens of thousands of dollars at the Trump hotel during a critical nine-day span in March 2018.
The timing of the hotel spending overlaps with Tillerson’s firing on March 13, whom “Saudi and Emirati officials had been reportedly lobbying President Trump to remove for his role in intervening to stop a Saudi invasion of Qatar the previous summer,” Maloney wrote.
Earlier this year, Tillerson testified during the trial of Trump ally Tom Barrack, who prosecutors accused of acting as an unregistered agent of the UAE, that the former president came up with the idea for a Camp David summit between the three countries to resolve the blockade crisis after initially supporting the move.
Barrack was found not guilty. But Tillerson’s testimony provided unique insight into the former president’s personal role in trying to broker a resolution between the three counties after initially supporting the UAE and Saudi governments.

Between March 7-14, 2018, the Saudi Defense Ministry spent $85,961, including renting several $10,500-a-night suites that were the most expensive rooms at the Trump hotel, according to Maloney’s letter and the documents obtained by the committee. While the names of the Saudi officials are not included in the documents, two of them are referred to as “His Excellency,” indicating they were members of the royal family or senior government ministers, Maloney added.
Separately, the Embassy of the UAE Military Delegation spent $34,037, largely on rooms, at the Trump hotel from March 8-16, 2018, the documents show.
Days after Saudi and Emirati officials stayed at the Trump hotel, Trump met with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman at the White House, where they discussed the situation in Qatar and ramping up US arms sales to the Saudis. During the meeting, Trump praised bin Salman and called Saudi Arabia “a great friend.”
It’s unclear whether bin Salman, the de facto ruler of Saudi Arabia, stayed at the hotel.
The Qatari government also spent hundreds of thousands of dollars at the Trump hotel starting in late 2017.
“Between January and early March 2018, the Sheikh Al Thani Family, the ruling family of Qatar, booked an extended stay at the Trump Hotel, spending at least $282,037,” Maloney notes in her letter.
Turkish-linked spending during DOJ investigation
The committee highlighted at least $86,000 in spending by advocacy groups and lobbyists with ties to the Turkish government at the Trump hotel at the time the Justice Department was investigating Halkbank, one of Turkey’s state-owned banks, for evading US sanctions by funneling cash and gold to Iran. Prosecutors had already charged several individuals, including one close to the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
CNN reported  that Erdogan had urged Trump in a phone call to drop a potential DOJ indictment into Halkbank. Trump told Erdogan he would have his people look into it.

The investigation into Halkbank was led by the U.S. attorney’s office for the Southern District of New York. Then-US Attorney General Bill Barr personally spearheaded an effort to negotiate a settlement with the bank that would have allowed it to sidestep an indictment, CNN previously reported.
Geoffrey Berman, the US attorney, insisted on criminal prosecution and later wrote in his memoir about his time as US attorney that he believed Barr was doing Trump’s bidding in pressuring his office to drop charges. Berman was fired eight months later.
Over a period of seven months beginning September 2017, lobbyist and Trump donor Brian Ballard spent $21,209 at the Trump hotel, according to the Maloney letter and committee records. Turkey paid Ballard’s lobbying shop $4.6 million over two years. He also worked for Halkbank as a lobbyist.
Ballard, who has not been charged with any wrongdoing, told CNN, “Prior to purchasing a residence in Washington in 2018, I stayed at a number of hotels in Washington, including the Trump Hotel, and paid fair market rates for those nights. There is nothing unusual, newsworthy or noteworthy about that fact.”
The committee said the records show that one day after Ballard checked out, a notation indicates “American-Turkish Council Call In” made an advance deposit for $65,139. The American-Turkish Council, an advocacy group, held two conferences at the Trump property, the committee said.
The Turkish embassy sponsored two hotel stays around the time of Erdogan’s May 2017 visit to Washington, Maloney wrote in her letter, though it’s unclear from the records how much the embassy spent for those stays.
A prime minister in the presidential suite
The biggest windfall the hotel received, according to the committee, came during a September 2017 visit by then-Prime Minister of Malaysia Najib Razak, his delegation and lobbyists who stayed at the hotel.
During the eight-day visit, Razak and his entourage spent $259,724 in room charges, restaurant bills and other expenses at Trump’s hotel while he was in town to meet with Trump at the White House several blocks away. Razak, who was under Justice Department investigation for allegedly looting Malaysia’s sovereign wealth fund of billions of dollars, stayed in the hotel’s presidential suite for $10,000 per night.
Lobbyist Elliott Broidy, who was also the deputy vice chair of the Republican National Committee, and an associate stayed at the hotel for four nights during that same period of time, incurring charges of more than $6,000. They previously were involved in – ultimately unsuccessful –efforts to lobby Trump and administration officials to drop the investigation into the sovereign wealth fund.
The Justice Department brought criminal charges against other individuals in connection with the scheme. Razak was not charged by US authorities, but he was prosecuted by Malaysian authorities for his role in the embezzlement scheme. Broidy and the associate both pleaded guilty to charges related to the secret lobbying effort. Broidy was pardoned by Trump at the end of his presidency.
The delegation’s expenses far exceeded the average revenue for other nights in September, the committee said, by nearly 2 to 1.
The accounting records obtained by the committee show that a Chinese Embassy Delegation was charged $19,391 at the Trump Hotel in August 2017, a little more than two months before Trump traveled to Beijing for a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Trump and Xi first met in April 2017 at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort, and Trump’s relationship with the Chinese leader was among the most crucial for US foreign policy during his presidency.

Billionaire Elon Musk said on Monday he was working “at the absolute most amount … from morning til night, seven days a week” when asked about his recent acquisition of Twitter and his leadership of automaker Tesla.
“I have too much work on my plate that is for sure,” Musk said by videolink to a business conference on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Bali.
Elon Musk heads to court over Tesla pay that made him the world's richest person
Musk, who is chief executive of both companies, appeared lit by candles, wearing a batik shirt sent by the organizers and said he was speaking from a place that had just lost power.
The question of whether Tesla (TSLA) will suffer because Musk is preoccupied with Twitter has become a focus for investors and analysts.
Indonesia has been trying to secure a deal with Tesla on battery investment and potentially for Elon Musk’s SpaceX aerospace company to develop a rocket launch site.
Musk made no commitment to either of those but said Indonesia had a large role to play in the electric vehicle supply chain and that it would make sense “long term” for SpaceX to have multiple launch points around the globe.

Coast-to-coast cold as US plunges into winter this week

 — 
Despite the calendar saying it’s mid-November, winter has arrived across the Lower 48 and could stick around through Thanksgiving next week.
This week, snow flurries and an arctic chill are in the air for millions across the nation. A low-pressure system across the Southwest will sweep across the central Plains today, bringing with it rain and snow showers.
It will be the first notable winter weather event of the season for most in the region, according to the Weather Prediction Center.
“While uncertainty remains regarding the location of the heaviest axis of snow, the potential exists for snowfall totals of 3 to 6 inches across west-central Oklahoma,” the prediction center said. “Light snow totals are also possible across southern Kansas and the Texas panhandle.”
Winter weather alerts are in place across the region, including Kansas City, Oklahoma City, Wichita in Kansas, Amarillo in Texas, and Fort Smith in Arkansas. The falling snow will lead to reduced visibility and hazardous driving conditions today.
The system will push east this week and with well-below-normal temperatures already in place. Ice, sleet, and snow showers are possible across the Midwest and into interior parts of the Northeast Tuesday and Wednesday.
Coastal areas of the mid-Atlantic and Northeast are currently forecast to see a cold rain, as temperatures are expected to remain just above freezing.
If you haven’t already, you may want to pull out your winter coats and sweaters. More than 225 million people across the Lower 48 will experience temperatures at or below freezing this week, which is about 70 percent of the US population.
The cold temperatures are already in place with readings running 10 to 20 degrees below normal for many, highs below freezing across the northern Plains and upper Midwest, and highs only in the 50s across the South.
The Central Plains are seeing the coldest temperatures compared to average with highs 25 to 30 degrees below normal today.
Only Florida is escaping the early winter chill, but even the Sunshine State will get in on the cooler air later this week.
By Thursday, another bout of arctic air will surge south from Montana into the central Plains and Midwest by Friday, reinforcing cold temperatures of 25 to 35 degrees below normal.
If the cold air helps you get into the holiday spirit, you are in luck! This arctic air is expected to stick around for much of the nation through Thanksgiving week. The bull’s-eye of the arctic air next week will stretch across the Great Lakes, south to the Tennessee River Valley.
CNN Weather
We will have more details on how cold your Thanksgiving week could be and any travel hazards to be prepared for in next Monday’s Weather Brief.
In the meantime, now that cold and wintry weather has begun, we wanted to share with you a few weather terms you are likely to hear a lot about this season. And it might give you a little something to impress your friends with your weather knowledge.
Polar Vortex
It is not a new term, but the polar vortex is always present and always has been.
It’s a large area of low pressure and cold air surrounding the Earth’s North and South poles and is located tens of thousands of feet into the atmosphere. This counterclockwise flow of air helps keep the very cold air near the poles.
VIDEO
What is a polar vortex?
“Many times, during winter in the Northern Hemisphere, the polar vortex will expand, sending cold air southward with the jet stream,” the National Weather Service explained. “This occurs fairly regularly during wintertime and is often associated with large outbreaks of Arctic air in the United States.”
February 2021 was a classic example of the polar vortex weakening, sending a surge of Arctic air very far south. One week in February, every state in the US experienced temperatures below freezing.
Sometimes the cold air will dive down and meet warm, moist air traveling north from the Gulf and Atlantic, and you end up with a Nor’easter.
Read more about the Polar vortex.
Nor’easter
If you are one of our friends in the Northeast, you are no stranger to nor’easters, which are storms which travel north along the East Coast. It gets its name because winds over coastal areas are generally out of the northeast.
VIDEO
What is a nor'easter?
“They nearly always bring precipitation in the form of heavy rain or snow, as well as winds of gale force, rough seas, and, occasionally, coastal flooding to the affected regions,” the weather service noted. “The heavily populated region between Washington, DC, Philadelphia, New York and Boston, the ‘I-95 Corridor,’ is especially impacted by nor’easters.”
Nor’easters can cripple this region of the country by snarling traffic, bringing flights to a halt and sometimes resulting in power outages.
If the nor’easter strengthens rapidly, we can end up with a bomb cyclone.
Watch as our very own Meteorologist Jennifer Gray explains more about a nor’easter.
Bomb Cyclone
A bomb cyclone is a rapidly strengthening storm which drops 24 millibars (a unit of pressure) in 24 hours. It’s as simple as that. Nothing explodes, but they can be dangerous.
VIDEO
Just what exactly is a 'bomb cyclone'?
We have seen bomb cyclones affect the Northeast as well as West Coast with hurricane-like furry.
Just last year, this West Coast bomb cyclone brought hurricane-force winds, 20-foot seas, rain and snow to a huge chunk of the West.
Our Meteorologist Brandon Miller explains what you need to know about these bomb cyclones.
Winter weather is interesting, no matter how you categorize it. But if Mother Nature throws a punch during the winter, you might be lucky enough to hear thundersnow!
Thundersnow
While winter thunderstorms are far less common than summer thunderstorms, they can occur.
“Thundersnow occurs where there is relatively strong instability and abundant moisture above the surface of the Earth, such as above a warm front,” the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said. “The ingredients that create thundersnow are similar to the dynamics of a typical thunderstorm – moisture, instability, and a lifting mechanism.”
VIDEO
This is what thundersnow sounds like
We’ve heard thundersnow several times while covering big snow events, and it sounds different from summertime thunder. The heavy snowfall can muffle the sound of the thunder, making it sound more like a slow rumble and not as booming.
And yes, thundersnow does indicate lightning is in your proximity, so treat it the same as you would a thunderstorm and seek shelter.

Supreme Court says House January 6 committee can get Kelli Ward’s phone and text records
By Ariane de Vogue, CNN Supreme Court Reporter
Updated 11:46 AM EST, Mon November 14, 2022

 — 
The Supreme Court cleared the way on Monday for the House select committee investigating the January 6 US Capitol attack to obtain the phone and text records of Arizona Republican Party Chair Kelli Ward.
Ward served as a fake elector for Donald Trump in Arizona, one of the states the former president lost but where Republicans gathered to put forth a pro-Trump slate of electors.
Ward has argued the subpoena was too intrusive and violated her First Amendment rights, potentially exposing political connections. The committee has also sought Ward’s testimony. She invoked her Fifth Amendment rights during the deposition.
Supreme Court says House January 6 committee can get Kelli Ward's phone and text records
The justices declined Ward’s request to freeze the subpoena and lifted a temporary order earlier put in place Justice Elena Kagan, who supervises the appeals court that ruled in the case.
Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito would have agreed to block the subpoena, the court said.
The move is the latest dispute concerning January 6 to come before the conservative-leaning court. Last January, the high court cleared the way for the release of presidential records from the Trump White House to the committee. Only Thomas publicly noted a vote in favor of Trump.
The subpoena from the House select committee directs T-Mobile USA, Inc., to release call records from Ward’s phone for the period of November 1, 2020, through January 31, 2021, and only sought times and durations of calls when Ward served as an elector for Trump.
The records do not include content or location information. A district court judge ruled against Ward and the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed.
“The subpoena is substantially related to the important government interest in investigating the causes of the January 6 attack and protecting future elections from similar threats,” the appeals court said.
“The investigation, after all, is not about Ward’s politics; it is about her involvement in the events leading up to the January 6 attack, and it seeks to uncover those with whom she communicated in connection with those events,” the appeals court added. “That some of the people with whom Ward communicated may be members of a political party does not establish that the subpoena is likely to reveal ‘sensitive information about [the party’s] members and supporters.”
In the emergency application filed with Kagan, Ward’s attorneys argued the case is “unprecedented” with “profound precedential implications for future congressional investigations and political associational rights under the First Amendment.”
If Ward’s telephone and text messages are disclosed, they added, “congressional investigators are going to contact every person who communicated with her during and immediately after the tumult of the 2020 election.”
Clarence Thomas was 'key' to a plan to delay certification of 2020 election, Trump lawyers said in emails
In response, lawyers for the select committee articulated they sought the phone records because Ward was at the center of several efforts after the election to undermine the popular vote and “aided a coup attempt.”
“These records will shed light on how Dr. Ward contributed to the multi-part effort to interfere with the peaceful transition of power and the attack on the U.S. Capitol,” the lawyers wrote.
The House noted Ward told officials in Arizona to stop counting ballots after the 2020 election; encouraged local officials to contact Trump’s lawyer Sidney Powell; tried to organize a phone call between Trump and the Maricopa County board of supervisors’ chairman; and she was among the group that sent false electoral votes for Trump to Congress.
In a court filing Monday night, T-Mobile said that it “now intends to fulfill its obligations under the Subpoena by producing to the Committee all responsive records.”

 — 
While a number of major brands have announced advertising pauses on Twitter in the wake of Elon Musk’s acquisition, the platform has scored a new ad buy from one notable billion-dollar business: Musk’s SpaceX.
Musk confirmed on Twitter Monday that his aerospace company, SpaceX, bought a package to advertise its Starlink internet service on Twitter, though he downplayed the size of the ad buy.
The ad buy would be the first for any of Musk’s companies, including Tesla, which does not engage in traditional advertising.
“SpaceX Starlink bought a tiny – not large – ad package to test effectiveness of Twitter advertising in Australia & Spain,” Musk wrote in a reply to one Twitter user, adding that he did the same on competitors such as Facebook, Instagram and Google.
Musk's Twitter may have already violated its latest FTC consent order, legal experts say
His remarks came after CNBC reported Sunday that Musk had ordered “one of the larger advertising packages available from Twitter” for SpaceX, citing unnamed sources who had viewed internal documents related to the matter. SpaceX did not respond to CNN Business request for comment.
In the weeks since Musk completed the Twitter takeover, some civil rights groups have called for an advertiser boycott of the platform, citing concerns about the direction under its new owner and reports that incidents of hate speech have ticked up on the platform.
A number of major brands including General Mills, the North Face and several car companies (which compete with Musk’s Tesla) have announced they are pausing ads on the social network. Earlier this month, Musk said the growing pullback in advertiser spending has led to a “massive drop in revenue.” He blasted the situation as “extremely messed up!”
Musk has spent his first weeks running Twitter pleading with advertisers to remain on the platform and also working make the platform less reliant on ad dollars by adding more subscription options, including a controversial option to pay for verification. The latter feature led to a wave of accounts impersonating prominent brands on the platform.

 — 
Police have in custody a University of Virginia student and ex-UVA football player suspected of fatally shooting three current players and wounding two other people late Sunday at the school’s main campus in Charlottesville as a bus returned from a class field trip, school officials said.
The suspect, Christopher Darnell Jones Jr., faces three charges of second-degree murder and three counts of using a handgun in the commission of a felony, UVA Police Chief Timothy Longo Sr. told reporters Monday morning as an hourslong manhunt came to an end and authorities lifted a campus lockdown order.
Classes canceled Tuesday as campus mourns the shooting victims
Jones was arrested without incident around 11 a.m. ET about 80 miles east of Charlottesville in Henrico County, the county police agency said in a statement. An officer spotted the vehicle Jones was driving in the eastern area of Henrico where he was “taken into custody without incident,” according to news release from the police division.
Police have not offered a motive for the attack.

Those killed were Devin Chandler, Lavel Davis Jr. and D’Sean Perry, university President Jim Ryan said. The two wounded students are being treated at UVA Medical Center, with one in critical condition and the other in good condition, he said, declining to name them.
One of the two injured students was identified as Michael Hollins, according to Andrew Martin, the head football coach at the University Lab School in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Hollins is a junior at UVA and is a running back for school’s football team, according to the team’s roster. CNN has reached out to Hollins’ family but has not received a response.
Hollins’ father, Michael Hollins Sr., told The Washington Post his son was shot in the back with the bullet lodged in his stomach. Hollins Sr. told the Post he’s expected to recover.
Left to right: Devin Chandler, D'Sean Perry and Lavel Davis Jr.
“This is a sad, shocking and tragic day for our UVA community,” Ryan said. “Let me say how deeply sorry I am for the victims and for their family and friends.”
Carla Williams, UVA athletics director, said in a statement that as a mother herself, she aches for the parents and family members of the victims.
“We lost three talented and bright young men,” Williams said. “We will never see what their impact on the world would have been, but we will never forget their impact on us. I miss Lavel, D’Sean and Devin. I pray for peace, comfort and hope for their parents and loved ones.”
Tony Elliot, UVA head football coach, said in a statement that it’s hard for him to find the words to “express the devastation and heartache that our team is feeling today.”
“These were incredible young men with huge aspirations and extremely bright futures. Our hearts ache for their families, their classmates and their friends. These precious young men were called away too soon,” Elliot said. “We are all fortunate to have them be a part of our lives. They touched us, inspired us and worked incredibly hard as representatives of our program, university and community.”
Deadliest Mass Shootings in the US Fast Facts
At least 68 shootings have unfolded this year on US school grounds, including 15 on college campuses, CNN finds, with at least one person shot in each case, not including the shooter. The deadliest school shooting in modern US history remains the 2007 attack at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg, where a 23-year-old student killed 32 people before dying by suicide.
The shooting at the Charlottesville campus is also one of nearly 600 mass shootings in the US this year, according to the Gun Violence Archive, which like CNN tallies cases in which at least four people are shot, excluding the shooter.
Shooting prompted immediate lockdowns
The attack happened Sunday on a bus returning from a class trip to Washington, DC, where the class had seen a play, university officials said. It was not immediately clear if Jones was part of that class or attended the field trip.
Police responded to a report of shots fired around 10:30 p.m. in an area near a parking garage on Culbreth Road and surrounded by academic buildings, Ryan said. Two slain victims were inside the bus, with the third victim taken to a hospital, where he died, Longo said.
Police on Monday secure the crime scene of an overnight shooting at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville.

The call prompted a shelter-in-place alert that was lifted about 12 hours later, Longo said. More than 500 people sheltered throughout campus buildings, including in libraries and classrooms, he said.
Monday classes at the university were canceled. The school canceled classes Tuesday to “to give “students the opportunity to reflect, mourn and gather with each other,” according to a news release. A family and community assistance center has also been set up on campus to provide UVA community members with mental health services, according to UVA Emergency Management officials.
Classes were also canceled Monday at Charlottesville City Schools, the K-12 district said in a letter to families. A UVA men’s basketball game scheduled for Monday evening has also been canceled, the university said.
In a statement, an attorney for Perry’s parents thanked the communities in both Charlottesville and South Florida – Perry was originally from Miami, the university said – for “the outpouring of support during this impossibly tragic time.
Happy and Sean Perry would not speak publicly at this time about their son’s death, attorney Michael Haggard said, out of respect for the university community, which “has been terrorized by another mass shooting in the United States.”
Suspect had been known to campus police
Jones had come to campus authorities’ attention in September, when authorities found out Jones “had made a comment about possessing a gun” to someone “unaffiliated with the university,” Longo said at Monday’s news conference. But that person never actually saw the gun in question, he said.
Christopher Darnell Jones Jr.
“Through the course of the threat assessment team’s investigation, we learned of a prior criminal incident involving a concealed weapon violation that occurred outside the city of Charlotteville in February of 2021,” Longo said, adding the suspect was required to report that incident to the university but never did. The school’s judicial council took over the case, and the results are pending.
Jones was also involved in a hazing investigation on campus that was closed because witnesses would not cooperate, Longo said.
What we know about the suspect in the deadly University of Virginia shooting
It is “important to share that information with you,” he said, “to let you know that he had been called to our attention.”
Jones is listed on UVA’s athletics website as a football player in 2018 who as a freshman did not participate in any games. He attended Varina High School and Petersburg High School, where he played football as a linebacker and running back, according to his university athletics bio. While in high school, Jones was Key Club president and a member of the National Honor Society and the National Technical Honor Society, the bio says.
A UVA spokesperson told CNN Jones had a pre-existing injury that prevented him from playing on the football team in 2018. Jones went through medical treatment and rehabilitation during his time with the team and was only a member of the team for one season, the spokesperson says.
The spokesperson would not give details on Jones’ injury.
Federal prosecutors working with local authorities
Before the lockdown was lifted, UVA students early Monday were told to “take the shelter in place commands seriously as the situation remains active,” vice president and chief student affairs officer Robyn Hadley said in an email to UVA’s student body.
“We have all received several shelter in place texts, and they are frightening,” Hadley said, adding several police jurisdictions were working to find the suspect. “I am on grounds like many of you; I am sheltering in place and in direct touch with University leadership and UPD … If you are not inside and safe, immediately seek safety.”
Two UVA students who told CNN they were at the scene of the shooting Sunday night and saw part of it unfold described hearing faint popping noises and watching people flee the bus.
The students – both of whom are 21 and did not want to be identified – said they were walking to the gym when they saw the charter bus, still in motion. It was just after 10 p.m. when they heard the popping noises, the students said, but they didn’t think anything of it. The bus was going over a speed bump, they said, but then they saw it stop and saw emergency lights turn on.
4 University of Idaho students found dead in home outside campus in what police are calling a homicide
The bus doors opened, the students said, and they saw people running out. The students told CNN they saw one fall to the ground.
The students hid behind a brick wall in front of the nearby band building before calling 911 around 10:17 p.m., they said. The call wasn’t answered, the students said, but they hung up when they heard sirens in the distance and saw law enforcement arrive.
State and federal prosecutors are helping local agencies in the investigation, according to a joint statement from the US attorney for the Western District of Virginia and commonwealth’s attorneys for Charlottesville and for Albemarle County. The officials pledged to support the investigation and “bring possible charges in the appropriate jurisdiction,” the statement said.
Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin on Monday called the shooting a “horrific tragedy” and praised the work of law enforcement for taking the suspect into custody, according to a tweet. “While there are still many details to uncover, let us lift up the entire community in prayer.” The governor earlier had said Virginia State Police were “fully coordinating” with school and local police.
Vice President Kamala Harris spoke on the shooting shortly after swearing in a new ambassador to Trinidad and Tobago on Monday.
“It’s tragic,” Harris said. “Of course, our prayers are with the families of the victims and it’s just yet a constant reminder that we have to do better in terms of gun safety laws in our country.”
Meantime, another US campus – the University of Idaho – is reeling after police announced a homicide inquiry after officers Sunday discovered four people deceased in a home just outside Moscow campus grounds. The deceased were students, and the cause of their deaths is not yet known, the university confirmed, adding the threat has ended.
Separately, Charlottesville Police arrested a man in connection to “threatening social media posts” against UVA on Monday, but said they don’t believe the threats were tied to the earlier shooting.
“We understand the fear this caused in our community and acted swiftly to resolve this investigation,” a Charlottesville police news release said.
Sunday’s shooting is the University of Virginia’s latest high-profile run-in with violence: White nationalists in August 2017 marched across campus carrying torches and chanting racist slogans. A day later, demonstrators protesting Charlottesville’s plan to remove a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee clashed with counterprotesters, one of whom was killed when a man drove his car into a crowd; that driver is serving life in prison.
A UVA lacrosse player five years earlier was convicted and sentenced to 23 years in prison for the 2010 killing of his ex-girlfriend, Yeardley Love, in her off-campus apartment.

The oldest living person in the US just turned 115
By Zoe Sottile, CNN
Published 3:02 AM EST, Sat November 12, 2022
Bessie Hendricks (center), the oldest living person in the US, celebrated her 115th birthday on November 7th.

Bring out the candles – 115 of them.
Bessie Hendricks, the oldest living person in the United States, has celebrated yet another turn around the sun. The Iowa supercentenarian turned 115 on November 7, according to CNN affiliate KCCI.
The world's oldest person is a French nun who enjoys chocolate and wine
Hendricks was born in 1907. Her lifetime has seen 21 presidents, two world wars, and the sinking of the Titanic.
In addition to being the oldest living person in the United States, she is also the fourth-oldest living person in the world, according to the Gerontology Research Group, which records and certifies supercentenarians (people who have lived to be older than 110).
Hendricks celebrated her 115th birthday alongside her three children at Shady Oaks Care Center, according to KCCI.
“I don’t know how you put it into words,” said her daughter, Joan Schaffer, according to KCCI. Schaffer turned 90 the day before her mother’s 115th birthday. “It’s marvelous that we still have her.”
Hendricks’ children described her as a hard-working, caring mother. Hendricks’ own mother died when she was just 13 years old, according to KCCI.
Currently, the title for oldest living person belongs to Lucile Randon, a 118-year old French nun, says the Gerontology Research Group. The oldest person ever recorded was another Frenchwoman, Jeanne Louise Calment, who lived to be over 122 years old, according to the Guinness World Records. Calment died in 1997.

Iran issues first death sentence linked to recent protests

CNN
 — 
An Iranian court has issued the first death sentence linked to recent protests, convicting the unnamed person of “enmity against God” and “spreading corruption on Earth,” state media reports.
It comes following weeks of nationwide demonstrations, sparked by the death of Mahsa Amini in September.
Iran’s Revolutionary Court issued the sentence to a protester who allegedly set fire to a government building, reported state media.
They were convicted on the charge of “disturbing public order and peace, community, and colluding to commit a crime against national security, war and corruption on Earth, war through arson, and intentional destruction,” according to state news agency IRNA on Sunday.
Five others who took part in the protests received sentences of five to 10 years in prison, convicted of “collusion to commit a crime against national security and disturbance of public peace and order.”
IRNA added that these decisions are preliminary and can be appealed. The news agency did not name the protester who received the death sentence or provide details on when or where they committed the alleged crime.
An Iranian court issued the first death sentence to a protester, as authorities have cracked down on those involved in anti-regime demonstrations sparked by the death of Mahsa Amini.

Iran has been rocked by anti-regime protests since September in the greatest demonstration of dissent in recent years, sparked by outrage over the death of Amini, a 22-year-old Kurdish Iranian woman who had been detained by the morality police for allegedly not wearing her hijab properly.
Iranian authorities have since unleashed a brutal crackdown on protesters, having charged at least 1,000 people in Tehran province for their alleged involvement.
Security forces have killed at least 326 people since the protests began two months ago, according to the Norway-based Iran Human Rights NGO.

That figure includes 43 children and 25 women, the group said in an update to its death toll on Saturday, saying that its published number represented an “absolute minimum.”
CNN cannot independently verify the figure as non-state media, the internet, and protest movements in Iran have all been suppressed. Death tolls vary by opposition groups, international rights organizations and journalists tracking the ongoing protests.
Despite the threat of arrests – and harsher punishments for those involved – Iranian celebrities and athletes have stepped forward to support the anti-government protests in recent weeks.
On Friday, United Nations experts urged Iranian authorities “to stop indicting people with charges punishable by death for participation, or alleged participation, in peaceful demonstrations” and “to stop using the death penalty as a tool to squash protests.”

18 students, driver injured in Kentucky school bus crash, officials say
By Kiely Westhoff and Theresa Waldrop, CNN
Updated 4:47 PM EST, Mon November 14, 2022
The bus crashed early Monday in Magoffin County, Kentucky.
WKYT
CNN
 — 
All 18 students and a driver have “varying degrees of injuries” after their bus crashed in eastern Kentucky early Monday, a school official said.
No fatalities have been reported, Magoffin County School District Superintendent Chris Meadows said in a statement.
The students range from elementary to high school, according to the Kentucky Department of Education.

A county spokesman said earlier that the driver and 21 students were hospitalized, some with critical injuries. The error came about because the preliminary list of injured included duplicate names, Meadows said.
The injured were taken by helicopter or ambulance to hospitals, Meadows said.
The bus was the only vehicle in the crash, said Kentucky State Police spokesman Paul Blanton. The driver appeared unable to answer questions, he said.
The bus was east of Salyersville, the county seat, when it “left the roadway,” according to a spokesperson for the state education department.
The initial investigation indicates that it then went over an embankment, a Kentucky State Police spokesperson said at a news conference Monday afternoon.
The bus, which did not have seat belts, looked like it had rolled over and landed on its side, according to Meadows.
First responders needed to use rescue equipment, including ropes and Stokes baskets, to pull the children up the hill, said Magoffin County Fire Chief Paul Howard.
A few of the students had already climbed up the hill when he arrived, Howard said.
The stretch of road where the crash occurred is “an area that has been slated for the possibility of putting up a guardrail,” but water and sewer infrastructure under the road has complicated the process, Magoffin County Executive Judge Matt Wireman said.
Asked if they would review seat belt requirements for students on district school buses, Meadows said they would need to review state guidelines but, “when it comes to student safety, everything’s on the table.”
Multiple surrounding counties sent people to help the lone dispatcher who was on duty when a student called 911 to report the crash, Wireman said.
“We had the all-call that went out today and surrounding counties answered that call, and they came to help our children and I just can’t thank them enough,” he said.
Officials at the news conference did not have any updates on the medical conditions of the injured.

John Aniston, ‘Days of Our Lives’ actor and Jennifer Aniston’s father, dead at 89

 — 
John Aniston, a veteran actor known for his work on the daytime drama “Days of Our Lives,” has died, his daughter, actress Jennifer Aniston, shared on Monday.
He was 89.
“You were one of the most beautiful humans I ever knew. I am so grateful that you went soaring into the heavens in peace - and without pain. And on 11/11 no less! You always had perfect timing,” Jennifer Aniston wrote in a statement shared on Instagram. “That number will forever hold an even greater meaning for me now.”
The “Friends” star began her post by writing “Sweet papa…⁣ John Anthony Aniston.”⁣
The actor appeared in numerous TV series and nearly three thousand episodes of “Days of Our Lives” over the course of his long career.
“I’ll love you till the end of time,” Aniston concluded her caption. “Don’t forget to visit.”
Aniston was born John Anastassakis on the Greek island of Crete in 1933. He emigrated to the US when he was 10, and his family shortened their surname to Aniston.
Before he became a soap star, Aniston served in the US Navy and appeared in an off-Broadway musical, Soap Opera Digest reported.
He got his big break when he was cast in the long-running soap “Love of Life” and later “Search for Tomorrow.” But he didn’t become a household name until he joined “Days of our Lives” in 1985 as “romantic villain” Victor Kiriakis, a criminal with a penchant for charming the women of Salem, Illinois.
Kiriakis, like Aniston, hailed from Greece but was much more sinister: He was a mobster who ran a prostitution ring in town. Over the course of the series, Kiriakis experienced several changes of heart and bounced back and forth between his lawbreaking gangster persona and loving family man hoping to win back his adult children. All told, Aniston appeared on the series on and off for 37 years.
During his stints on soaps, Aniston opened a restaurant in New York, divorced his first wife, Nancy Dow, and married costar Sherry Rooney and moved to Los Angeles, according to a 1986 Soap Opera Digest profile of Aniston.
Aniston was surprised his daughter planned to follow him into show business. In a 2019 interview with the Television Academy Foundation, Aniston said he found out his daughter had been calling his agent to ask for auditions while he was appearing on “Search for Tomorrow.”
“I told her, ‘You don’t want to be in show business. Show business stinks,’” he said. “I tell everybody who wants to be an actor, don’t be an actor, be something else. Because if my telling (them) to stay out of show business is gonna keep them out, they shouldn’t be in it in the first place.”
Of course, Aniston’s daughter didn’t listen, and went on to star in one of the most successful sitcoms of all time, and become one of the most famous actresses in the world.
In a 1990 interview with E! News alongside his daughter, Aniston offered both fatherly praise and sobering guidance: “Jennifer is a natural talent,” he said to his daughter’s embarrassment, but reminded her that talent doesn’t always result in a long career.
But Aniston’s own career in soaps lasted more than 50 years, and in June, he was awarded a Lifetime Achievement Emmy at the Daytime Emmy Awards. He didn’t attend the ceremony, but his daughter toasted him in a moving speech.
“For over 30 years, his dedication to (“Days”) has gained him respect and admiration of his fellow actors, deep friendships and thrilled millions of fans around the world,” she said. “His career is literally the definition of lifetime achievement.”

Taylor Swift's jewel-adorned MTV awards look was inspired by Queen Elizabeth II
Updated 14th November 2022

Leah Dolan, CNN
Taylor Swift arrived at MTV's Europe Music Awards last night in Düsseldorf, Germany in an evening gown that flipped the scripts on red carpet jewelry.
With her decolletage and wrists left entirely bare, Swift opted for just a few silver rings and a spiral of studded ear cuffs on each ear — but her outfit was far from lacking in adornments. Instead of the conventional smatterings of jewels, Swift stepped out in a cascading midi skirt made entirely from a shimmering net of handmade silver and green crystals.

The custom David Koma look, a nod to the designer's Fall-Winter 2023 collection, was paired with a black spaghetti-strap body and open toed sling-backs. The skirt's emerald-toned jewels were inspired by the late Queen Elizabeth II's own emerald collection, according to a spokesperson the label.

Away from the red carpet, Swift became the evening's top winning artist, scooping up four awards including Best Artist, Best Video, Best Pop and Best Longform Video for ""All Too Well (10 Minute Version) (Taylor's Version).""

The pop star wore a second David Koma look to accept the accolades on stage: A black and silver crystalized polo-shirt dress acted as the perfect backdrop to her armful of silver MTV trophies.

Golfer gives fans $100 to buy beers for moving out of shadows
By Jack Bantock, CNN
Published 7:44 AM EST, Mon November 14, 2022
Pádraig Harrington hands money to a fan to buy beers at the Charles Schwab Cup Championship on Sunday.
PGA TOUR Champions/Twitter
CNN
 — 
The beers were well and truly on Pádraig Harrington on Sunday.
Surging towards an emphatic victory at the Charles Schwab Cup Championship – the PGA Tour Champions season finale – drinks were already set to flow for the Irishman, but Harrington seemed determined to start the party early.
Lining up his opening drive at the par-three 15th, the three-time major winner paused to turn to the onlooking grandstand to politely ask a group of fans to move seats.
There had been no major disturbance, the issue was simply the long shadows that the spectators had been casting over the tee.
“They’ve been sitting there, I assume all day, waiting for this,” Harrington told reporters. “I hope they were waiting for me.
“I got them to move, they still had a good view.”
As if to say thank you, Harrington proceeded to smoke a flawless approach shot onto the green, the ball rolling up within birdie-striking distance.

Flashing a grateful smile and wave towards the grandstand, the 51-year-old had one more token of appreciation to pass on. Approaching one fan at the sideline, Harrington handed over a wad of cash – to be spent specifically on beers.
In May, Justin Thomas admitted to being blown away by the eye-watering $18 price of beer at the PGA Championship in Tulsa, and it seems similar calculations were on Harrington’s mind in Arizona.

“I gave it to one guy, but it was for everybody in the area,” Harrington said.
“I actually went in with 50 and then I kind of said, ‘Probably only get a few beers for 50, I better go back with 100.’”
The good cheer continued as Harrington sealed a dominant victory three holes later, finishing seven strokes ahead of runner-up Alex Cejka of Germany.
In carding 27-under, the Irishman matched the PGA Tour Champions record score in relation to par, equaling Jack Nicklaus’ effort at the Kaulig Companies Championship in 1990.
“I didn’t realize that,” Harrington said.
“It’s nice to hold the record with Jack Nicklaus, I believe he’s done it as well. Kind of glad I didn’t beat him.”
However, the victory wasn’t enough to see Harrington crowned overall Charles Schwab Cup champion, as Steven Alker’s third-place finish clinched the New Zealander the points needed to take the title.

Finau continues fine form
Meanwhile, Tony Finau continued his stunning 2022 journey with a similarly convincing triumph at the Houston Open.
Shooting 16-under, the American cruised to a four-shot triumph for his third PGA Tour victory of the calendar year at Memorial Park, a margin of victory that could have been even more dominant had it not been for three bogeys down the back nine.
Having ended a five-year wait for a PGA Tour win with victory at the FedEx St. Jude Championship in August 2021, the 33-year-old has now clinched four in his last 30 starts. Once labeled the ‘nearly-man’ of golf, he lifted two titles in July in the space of a week with back-to-back wins at the 3M Open and Rocket Mortgage Classic.

“I’ve always had belief, but confidence when you win is contagious,” Finau told reporters. “I’m starting to put together a full-package game.
“It was one of those days I fought and fought, and I made a lot of nice putts that calmed me. I’ve never been in this position. I had a lot of nerves.
“Overall, as the round went on, I felt better. I was happy to get the W today.”
Compatriot Tyson Alexander finished second on 12-under, a stroke ahead of England’s Ben Taylor, while ninth-placed Scottie Scheffler failed to register the win he needed to retake world No. 1 spot from Rory McIlroy.

The Neighbourhood drops drummer Brandon Fried after groping allegation

 — 
The Neighbourhood have ousted drummer Brandon Fried after he was accused of groping a woman and apologized for it.
María Zardoya, of the band The Marías, shared her account of the incident on the Instagram Stories portion of the band’s verified account.
“I was at a bar last night, and I was groped under the table by brandon fried, the drummer of the neighbourhood. It was one of the most uncomfortable things I’ve ever experienced,” she wrote. “I felt an invasion of my space, privacy and body. @thenbhd y’all need a new drummer, this guy is a complete creep.”
“We are grateful to Maria for coming forward,” The Neighbourhood wrote in a statement shared on their verified social media.
“We have zero tolerance for any kind of inappropriate behavior towards women,” the statement continued. “As a result of Brandon’s actions, he will no longer be a member of The Neighbourhood.”
Fried also released a statement on social media.
“I am so terribly sorry to María. My actions were inexcusable and intolerable,” he wrote in a statement posted on his Instagram stories. “They are not reflective of who I am as a person, but clearly a reflection of who I become under the influence.”
“It is evident that I must address my problems with alcohol and substance abuse, which I am now seeking help for,” he added.
“I want to apologize to women who have been victims of any behavior that has left them feeling uncomfortable or violated,” Fried concluded his statement. “I am also sorry to The Neighbourhood and our fans for letting them down.”
The band is best known for its hit song “Sweater Weather.”

Kate Winslet gives mother $20,000 to fund disabled child’s soaring electricity bill
By Toyin Owoseje, CNN

CNN
 — 
Oscar-winning actress Kate Winslet has donated £17,000 ($20,000) to a mother facing astronomical home energy bills to operate her disabled daughter’s life-support equipment.
Carolynne Hunter’s 12-year-old daughter Freya has cerebral palsy as well as other severe health problems and disabilities. She relies on receiving oxygen for chronic breathing problems and receives 24-hour at-home nursing care.
Earlier this month, the mother of four from Clackmannanshire, Scotland launched a GoFundMe campaign to help raise £20,000 ($24,000) for the running costs of the equipment that keeps her daughter alive.
“My annual cost for Electric & Gas as forecasted by an energy advisor at Clacks Council will most likely be around £17,000,” Hunter explained on the fundraising page.
Carolynne Hunter says Freya has severe and complex health needs and requires a high level of nursing support and equipment at home.

She told BBC Scotland that it currently costs her family £6,500 ($7,600) a year to run the equipment and heat the home, and they have already been forced to cut back in recent months. To keep costs as low as possible, Freya’s room was the only one being heated in order to keep her and the healthcare workers comfortable.
“The council have put solar panels up to help with blackouts but don’t think it’ll help with the bill,” Hunter said.
Days into the campaign, a donation of £17,000 marked “Kate Winslet and family” was paid to the fundraiser.
Hunter said she was overwhelmed by the generosity of the screen star, who also reached out to wish the family well.
Winslet is a patron of Go Beyond, a charity that provides free respite breaks for disadvantaged and underprivileged children across the UK.
“Our journey as a family has been very traumatic and I just feel done at this point in my life,” Hunter told BBC Scotland.
“When I heard about the money I just burst into tears – I thought it wasn’t even real. I’m still thinking is this real?”
CNN has reached out to Hunter and to Winslet’s representatives for comment.
Hunter and her family are among millions of Britons facing a challenging winter amid the UK’s economic turmoil and soaring energy costs.
World is in its 'first truly global energy crisis,' says IEA chief
“I’m going to be helped but what about everyone else?” she added. “I wanted the government to pay for it and do the right thing – it shouldn’t have to be a celebrity that steps in.”
In September, research firm Auxilione estimated that without a new plan to hold down prices, the average yearly energy bill for millions could top £5,700 ($6,700) from next April.
The government announced in May that UK households would receive a £400 reduction in energy bills, spread over six months from October.
And earlier this month, the Department for Work and Pensions said more than eight million households receiving benefits would get a £324 ($381) payment to help with the rise in the cost of living before the end of November.
“We understand that people are struggling and that is why we’ve consistently acted to ensure millions of low-income families are supported,” Work and Pensions Secretary Mel Stride said in a press statement.
“We will continue to act with compassion as we navigate challenging global economic circumstances.”
Reacting to Hunter’s plea for help, Scotland’s Social Justice Secretary, Shona Robison, told CNN in a statement: “We are painfully aware of the hardship people are facing right now, which is why the Scottish Government is doing all it can to support households in need.”
Robison added that while the power to cap energy prices rests with the UK government, “the Scottish Government has allocated almost £3 billion this financial year that will help households face the increased cost of living and rising energy prices.”
CNN has also reached out to UK energy minister Grant Shapps for comment.
CNN’s Anna Cooban contributed to this report.

 — 
American MMA lightweight fighter Anthony ‘Rumble’ Johnson has died at the age of 38 from an undisclosed illness, according to Bellator MMA.
“It is with great sadness we acknowledge the passing of Anthony ‘Rumble’ Johnson, Bellator MMA announced on social media on Sunday.
“The BELLATOR family is devastated by his untimely passing and we send our condolences to his family and friends during this difficult time.”
Johnson joined the UFC in 2007 and was ranked as the number one light heavyweight contender in 2014 before retiring in 2017.
After four years away from mixed martial arts, Johnson came out retirement and joined Bellator MMA in 2021.
In his final fight, Johnson defeated José Augusto by knockout to improve to 23-6 in his career.
Daniel Cormier, a two-time Olympian and MMA fighter paid tribute to Johnson.
“For a guy who struck fear into so many peoples heart Anthony Johnson was a caring person. From random text to check ins during loss. What a person he was, Rumble will be missed. Sometimes life doesn’t seem fair. Horrible news,” Cormier added.

CIA Director Bill Burns met with Russian counterpart Monday
By Natasha Bertrand, CNN
Updated 2:29 PM EST, Mon November 14, 2022

CNN
 — 
CIA Director Bill Burns met with his Russian intelligence counterpart, Sergey Naryshkin, in Ankara Monday as part of an ongoing effort by the US to “communicate with Russia on managing risk” and to discuss the cases of “unjustly detained US citizens,” a National Security Council spokesperson tells CNN.
“We have been very open about the fact that we have channels to communicate with Russia on managing risk, especially nuclear risk and risks to strategic stability,” the spokesperson said. “As part of this effort, Bill Burns is in Ankara today to meet with his Russian intelligence counterpart.”
CNN has previously reported that national security adviser Jake Sullivan has also been in touch with his Russian counterparts to warn them of the consequences should Russia use a nuclear weapon in Ukraine.
The spokesperson emphasized that Burns “is not conducting negotiations of any kind.”
“He is not discussing settlement of the war in Ukraine. He is conveying a message on the consequences of the use of nuclear weapons by Russia, and the risks of escalation to strategic stability. He will also raise the cases of unjustly detained US citizens.”
The spokesperson added that the US briefed Ukraine on the meeting in advance of Burns’ trip.
“We firmly stick to our fundamental principle: nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine,” the spokesperson said.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov confirmed that the meeting took place, according to Russian state media outlet TASS.
“Such negotiations really took place. It happened at the initiative of the American side,” Peskov said.
The Biden administration has dispatched Burns several times over the last year for talks with the Russians, using the veteran diplomat and former US ambassador to Russia as a key intermediary as US-Russia relations have continued to decline. Burns was sent to Moscow last November, before Russia invaded Ukraine, to warn the Kremlin of the consequences of an invasion. He has also been involved in discussions with Naryshkin about US citizens detained in Russia, including Brittney Griner and Paul Whelan.
The discussions are also part of an ongoing effort by the US to keep the lines of communication open with Moscow amid thinly veiled threats by Russian President Vladimir Putin that Russia could use a nuclear weapon in Ukraine.
“In the event of a threat to the territorial integrity of our country and to defend Russia and our people, we will certainly make use of all weapon systems available to us. This is not a bluff,” Putin warned in a speech in September.
He later appeared to reverse himself, saying in October that “we see no need for” nuclear weapons in Ukraine. “There is no point in that, neither political, nor military.”
Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and his Russian counterpart Sergei Shoigu also spoke by phone late last month for the first time since May, as intelligence surfaced that Russian military officials had discussed how and under what conditions Russia would use a tactical nuclear weapon on the battlefield in Ukraine, CNN has previously reported.
Russian officials also last month began alleging that Ukraine is preparing to use a “dirty bomb”– an allegation the US worried was simply a pretext for Russia to use one itself, and that the International Atomic Energy Agency debunked after an investigation of Ukrainian sites.
The US has still not seen any signs that Putin has decided to take the drastic step of using a nuclear weapon, officials said.

 — 
Amazon founder Jeff Bezos plans to give away the majority of his $124 billion net worth during his lifetime, telling CNN in an exclusive interview he will devote the bulk of his wealth to fighting climate change and supporting people who can unify humanity in the face of deep social and political divisions.
Though Bezos’ vow was light on specifics, this marks the first time he has announced that he plans to give away most of his money. Critics have chided Bezos for not signing the Giving Pledge, a promise by hundreds of the world’s richest people to donate the majority of their wealth to charitable causes.

Exclusive: Jeff Bezos offers his advice on taking risks right now
01:50 - Source: CNN
In a sit-down interview with CNN’s Chloe Melas on Saturday at his Washington, DC, home, Bezos, speaking alongside his partner, the journalist-turned-philanthropist Lauren Sánchez, said the couple is “building the capacity to be able to give away this money.”
Asked directly by CNN whether he intends to donate the majority of his wealth within his lifetime, Bezos said: “Yeah, I do.”
Bezos said he and Sánchez agreed to their first interview together since they began dating in 2019 to help shine a spotlight on the Bezos Courage and Civility Award, granted this year to musician Dolly Parton.
The 20-minute exchange with Bezos and Sánchez covered a broad range of topics, from Bezos’s views on political dialogue and a possible economic recession to Sánchez’s plan to visit outer space with an all-female crew and her reflections on a flourishing business partnership with Bezos.
Dolly Parton
That working relationship was on display Saturday as Bezos and Sánchez announced a $100 million grant to Parton as part of her Courage and Civility Award. It is the third such award, following similar grants to chef Jose Andrés, who has spent some of the money making meals for Ukrainians — and the climate advocate and CNN contributor Van Jones.
Dolly Parton receives $100 million Courage and Civility Award from Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez
“When you think of Dolly,” said Sánchez in the interview, “Look, everyone smiles, right? She is just beaming with light. And all she wants to do is bring light into other people’s worlds. And so we couldn’t have thought of someone better than to give this award to Dolly, and we know she’s going to do amazing things with it.”
The throughline connecting the Courage and Civility Award grantees, Bezos said, was their capacity to bring many people together to solve large challenges.
“I just feel honored to be able to be a part of what they’re doing for this world,” Bezos told CNN.
Unity, Bezos said, is a trait that will be necessary to confront climate change and one that he repeatedly invoked as he blasted politicians and social media for amplifying division.
How to give it away
But the couple’s biggest challenge may be figuring out how to distribute Bezos’ vast fortune. Bezos declined to identify a specific percentage or to provide concrete details on where it would likely be spent.
Despite being the fourth-wealthiest person in the world, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, Bezos has refrained from setting a target amount to give away in his lifetime.
Bezos has committed $10 billion over 10 years, or about 8% of his current net worth, to the Bezos Earth Fund, which Sánchez co-chairs. Among its priorities are reducing the carbon footprint of construction-grade cement and steel; pushing financial regulators to consider climate-related risks; advancing data and mapping technologies to monitor carbon emissions; and building natural, plant-based carbon sinks on a large scale.
Bezos donates $100 million each to CNN contributor Van Jones and chef Jose Andres
Though Bezos is now Amazon’s (AMZN) executive chair and not its CEO — he stepped down from that role in 2021 — he is still involved in the greening of the company. Amazon is one of more than 300 companies that have pledged to reduce their carbon footprint by 2040 according to the principles of the Paris Climate Agreement, Bezos said, though Amazon’s (AMZN) footprint grew by 18% in 2021, reflecting a pandemic-driven e-commerce boom. Amazon’s (AMZN) reckoning with its own effect on the climate mirrors its outsized impact on everything from debates about unionization to antitrust policy, where the company has attracted an enormous level of scrutiny from regulators, lawmakers, and civil society groups.
Bezos compared his philanthropic strategy to his years-long effort constructing a titanic engine of e-commerce and cloud computing that has made him one of the most powerful people in the world.
“The hard part is figuring out how to do it in a levered way,” he said, implying that even as he gives away his billions, he is still looking to maximize his return. “It’s not easy. Building Amazon was not easy. It took a lot of hard work, a bunch of very smart teammates, hard-working teammates, and I’m finding — and I think Lauren is finding the same thing — that charity, philanthropy, is very similar.”
“There are a bunch of ways that I think you could do ineffective things, too,” he added. “So you have to think about it carefully and you have to have brilliant people on the team.”
Bezos’ methodical approach to giving stands in sharp contrast to that of his ex-wife, the philanthropist MacKenzie Scott, who recently gave away nearly $4 billion to 465 organizations in the span of less than a year.
The economic downturn
While Bezos and Sánchez plot out their plans for Bezos’ immense wealth, many people of more modest means are bracing for what economists fear may be an extended economic downturn.
Last month, Bezos tweeted a warning to his followers on Twitter, recommending that they “batten down the hatches.”
'Batten down the hatches': Bezos and fellow billionaires are issuing recession warnings
The advice was meant for business owners and consumers alike, Bezos said in the interview, suggesting that individuals should consider putting off buying big ticket items they’ve been eyeing — or that companies should slow their acquisitions and capital expenditures.
“Take some risk off the table,” Bezos said. “Keep some dry powder on hand…. Just a little bit of risk reduction could make the difference for that small business, if we do get into even more serious economic problems. You’ve got to play the probabilities a little bit.”
Many may be feeling the pinch now, he added, but argued that as an optimist he believes the American Dream “is and will be even more attainable in the future” — projecting that within Bezos’ lifetime, space travel could become broadly accessible to the public.
Bezos and Sánchez’s partnership
Sánchez said the couple make “really great teammates,” though she laughed, “We can be kind of boring,” Sánchez said. Bezos smiled and replied, “Never boring.”
Sánchez, the founder of Black Ops Aviation, the first female-owned and operated aerial film and production company is a trained helicopter pilot. She said in the interview that they’ve both taken turns in the driver’s seat.
Bezos has credited his own journey to space for helping to inspire his push to fight climate change. Now, it is Sánchez’s turn.
Sánchez told CNN she anticipates venturing into orbit herself sometime in 2023. And while she did not directly address who will be joining her — quickly ruling out Bezos as a crewmate — she said simply: “It’ll be a great group of females.”
Washington’s NFL team
Jay-Z and Jeff Bezos are interested in buying the Washington Commanders together
Bezos may be adding NFL owner to his resume. CNN recently reported that Bezos and Jay-Z are in talks on a potential joint bid on the Washington Commanders.
It is not clear if the two have yet spoken with Dan Snyder and his wife, Tanya, the current owners of the NFL team, about the possibility.
But during the interview on Saturday, Melas asked Bezos if the speculation was true.
“Yes, I’ve heard that buzz,” Bezos said with a smile.
Sánchez chimed in with a laugh, “I do like football. I’m just going to throw that out there for everyone.”
Bezos added, “I grew up in Houston, Texas, and I played football growing up as a kid … and it is my favorite sport … so we’ll just have to wait and see.”

Zelensky visits Kherson after accusing Russia of committing hundreds of war crimes

 — 
Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenksy made a surprise visit to Kherson Monday to offer support to residents of the newly recaptured city, where investigators have begun to uncover possible proof of wartime atrocities committed during the months-long occupation by Russian forces.
Zelensky said in his nightly address Sunday that officials had uncovered evidence of more than 400 war crimes. Russian forces, Zelensky alleged, left behind a trail of devastation and dead bodies in the wake of their hasty evacuation, similar to what Ukrainian officials found in April in Bucha, a Kyiv suburb, and Borodianka, a city east of the Ukrainian capital.
“The situation in the Kherson region is still very dangerous,” Zelensky said.
Just hours later, Zelensky was in the eponymous regional capital to speak with local officials. He told reporters that it was important to travel to Kherson, noting that Ukrainian servicemen and journalists on the ground were taking similar risks.
“I think it is necessary to be here and talk about Kherson residents, to support people. To make them feel that we are not only talking about it, but we are really returning, really raising our flag,” he said.
Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky is seen visiting Kherson on Monday.
President of Ukraine
Russia’s military ordered its forces to evacuate from Kherson on Wednesday. On Friday, Moscow said it had withdrawn from the west bank of the strategically important Dnipro River, ceding large swathes of land that it had occupied since the early days of the war – effectively handing over Kherson city and its surrounding areas to the Ukrainians.
Ukrainian forces who entered the city on Saturday were greeted by jubilant residents cheering them and asking for autographs. A crowd of locals gathered in Kherson’s main square to sing the national anthem, while others shouted “Slava Ukrayini!” – glory to Ukraine, a patriotic greeting. Zelensky said about 70,000 to 80,000 people were still living in Kherson.
The retreat represents a major blow for Putin’s war effort in Ukraine. Kherson was the only Ukrainian regional capital that Russian forces had captured since February’s invasion, though it was one of the few regions where residents dared to protest against the Kremlin.
The region of Kherson is also one of four Ukrainian territories that Russia attempted to annex in violation of international law. Fewer than fives weeks ago, Russian President Vladimir Putin vowed people living in these areas would be Russian citizens “forever.”
When asked about Zelensky’s visit, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: “No comment. This is Russian territory.”
Danger remains
Though Russia has retreated from the city, Kherson is now a city on the front lines of the war.
Russian forces are now stationed just kilometers away, on the opposite bank of the Dnipro River. Ukraine’s military said Monday that Russian forces were conducting more aerial reconnaissance of Kherson, which could portend future airstrikes.
The most immediate issue, Ukrainian police said Saturday, was mines and explosives left behind by the Russian military.
Zelensky said Sunday that one sapper was killed and four others were injured in de-mining operations. A family of four – including an 11-year-old child – was also injured in a mine-related accident, a top Ukrainian official said Sunday.
Life inside the city remains difficult. Residents are without power and internet, and food and drinking water remain in short supply. The first aid convoys began to arrive in the city on Monday, a volunteer official said.
Critical infrastructure, including an important nearby dam, remain damaged and require repairs before coming back online.
Yaroslav Yanushevych, the head of the Kherson region military administration and Ukraine’s top official in the region, said all four power lines that supply electricity to the city had been destroyed.
“We are working on solving this problem day and night,” Yanushevych told reporters while appearing beside Zelensky on Monday. “The power will be restored in the near future.”
Kherson is one of many parts of Ukraine facing wartime power shortages. Since the end of summer, Russian forces have targeted energy infrastructure throughout Ukraine, crippling Kyiv’s ability to keep the lights and heat on as winter approaches. Zelensky said such attacks amount to “energy terrorism.”
“The coming months will be difficult. Putin’s aim is to leave Ukraine cold and dark this winter so we must stay the course,” NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg said Monday. “We should not make the mistake of underestimating Russia.”

At least 16 high school hockey players were injured after an allegedly intoxicated semi-truck driver crashed into their team bus

 — 
At least 16 junior varsity hockey players from Illinois were injured Saturday night in Warsaw, Indiana after an allegedly intoxicated semi-truck driver swerved into the team’s bus, knocking it onto its side.
Three of the injured high school students, who attend St. Ignatius College Prep, underwent surgery and were initially considered to be in critical condition, the school said in a statement. Warsaw is about 120 miles southwest from Chicago.
The Warsaw Police Department was notified of a tractor trailer swerving into other lanes and driving at excessive speed shortly after 8 p.m., according to a Sunday news release. Police were on their way to stop the truck when it struck the school bus in its rear.
Eyewitnesses and a surveillance camera showed the semi-truck driver ran a red light seconds before crashing into the bus as it was turning, police said. At least one of the students was ejected from the bus during the crash, Warsaw police added.

Police detected “a strong odor” of alcohol on the truck driver and said he was slurring and failed sobriety tests, the release said. The truck driver refused to consent to a chemical test, according to police.
The truck driver, a 58-year-old man from New York, remains in custody on a 48-hour hold as his blood sample were sent out for official testing. The driver faces felony charges pertaining to operating while intoxicated and causing serious bodily injury, according to police.
There were a total of 23 students, two coaches, and the driver on the rented school bus, police said, adding the students’ ages “range between 14 and 17 years old, with most children 15 years of age.”
“We will get through this together,” the Saint Ignatius Wolfpack Hockey Club said in the statement.
Saint Ignatius is a private Jesuit high school near Chicago whose JV hockey team was traveling across state lines for a weekend tournament in Culver. According to police, the team had dinner in Warsaw before heading to their hotel.

Tom Brady makes history as Tampa Bay Buccaneers win first-ever regular season game in Germany

 — 
Tom Brady has become well-accustomed at making history over his long and illustrious NFL career. And on Sunday, the 45-year-old set more historic marks from all the way across the globe.
Brady’s Tampa Bay Buccaneers beat the Seattle Seahawks 21-16 at the Allianz Arena in Germany, the NFL’s first regular season game in the country.
With the victory, Brady became the first quarterback to win an NFL game in three different countries outside of the US.
As a New England Patriot, Brady won all three of the international games he played in, with two in London and one in Mexico City.
And now, he can add Germany to the list as the NFL’s most decorated player adds another accolade to his ever-expanding collection.
After the victory, Brady described the atmosphere in the Allianz Arena – the home of German football giants, Bayern Munich – as “pretty electric.”

“It was a great atmosphere,” he told the NFL Network. “It felt like a pretty hyped up game when we came out for warm-ups.
“It was pretty electric so I hope the German fans got what they wanted. Great win by our team, we needed it. Played against a great opponent, our defense played great and I’m glad we found a way to slug it out and win.”
Despite a tough season prior to Sunday, Brady looked much more like himself, throwing a 31-yard touchdown pass to Julio Jones and with Leonard Fournette running for another as the Buccaneers raced into a 14-0 second lead.
With the Bucs up 14-3 in the third quarter, the team attempted to pull out all the stops as Fournette attempted to throw to Brady though Brady slipped and Fournette was intercepted by Tariq Woolen.
And when Chris Godwin caught a four-yard touchdown pass from Brady early in the fourth quarter, the result looked wrapped up with the score at 21-3.
However, a late comeback from the Seahawks meant the German fans went home with their fair share of excitement.
Tyler Lockett’s touchdown with just over eight minutes narrowed the gap and Brady’s untimely interception to Cody Barton was capitalized on by Seattle as Marquise Goodwin caught a touchdown pass from Seattle quarterback Geno Smith to reduce the deficit to just five with under four minutes to play.
Smith finished the afternoon with 275 passing yards and two touchdown passes.

But, just when they needed it, Tampa Bay produced a time-killing drive to kill the game off behind the running ability of Rachaad White – who ran for a career-high 105 yards – and secure the team’s fifth victory of the season and second in a row.
The Bucs now head into their bye week atop the NFC South and looking much more like the team that was predicted to vie for a Super Bowl ring.
For the Seahawks, after a promising start to the season, they fall to 6-4, but head back to the West coast of the US with their heads held high after showing resolve late on.

 — 
Police have in custody a University of Virginia student and ex-UVA football player suspected of fatally shooting three current players and wounding two other people late Sunday at the school’s main campus in Charlottesville as a bus returned from a class field trip, school officials said.
The suspect, Christopher Darnell Jones Jr., faces three charges of second-degree murder and three counts of using a handgun in the commission of a felony, UVA Police Chief Timothy Longo Sr. told reporters Monday morning as an hourslong manhunt came to an end and authorities lifted a campus lockdown order.
Classes canceled Tuesday as campus mourns the shooting victims
Jones was arrested without incident around 11 a.m. ET about 80 miles east of Charlottesville in Henrico County, the county police agency said in a statement. An officer spotted the vehicle Jones was driving in the eastern area of Henrico where he was “taken into custody without incident,” according to news release from the police division.
Police have not offered a motive for the attack.
Christopher Jones
Those killed were Devin Chandler, Lavel Davis Jr. and D’Sean Perry, university President Jim Ryan said. The two wounded students are being treated at UVA Medical Center, with one in critical condition and the other in good condition, he said, declining to name them.
One of the two injured students was identified as Michael Hollins, according to Andrew Martin, the head football coach at the University Lab School in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Hollins is a junior at UVA and is a running back for school’s football team, according to the team’s roster. CNN has reached out to Hollins’ family but has not received a response.
Hollins’ father, Michael Hollins Sr., told The Washington Post his son was shot in the back with the bullet lodged in his stomach. Hollins Sr. told the Post he’s expected to recover.

“This is a sad, shocking and tragic day for our UVA community,” Ryan said. “Let me say how deeply sorry I am for the victims and for their family and friends.”
Carla Williams, UVA athletics director, said in a statement that as a mother herself, she aches for the parents and family members of the victims.
“We lost three talented and bright young men,” Williams said. “We will never see what their impact on the world would have been, but we will never forget their impact on us. I miss Lavel, D’Sean and Devin. I pray for peace, comfort and hope for their parents and loved ones.”
Tony Elliot, UVA head football coach, said in a statement that it’s hard for him to find the words to “express the devastation and heartache that our team is feeling today.”
“These were incredible young men with huge aspirations and extremely bright futures. Our hearts ache for their families, their classmates and their friends. These precious young men were called away too soon,” Elliot said. “We are all fortunate to have them be a part of our lives. They touched us, inspired us and worked incredibly hard as representatives of our program, university and community.”
Deadliest Mass Shootings in the US Fast Facts
At least 68 shootings have unfolded this year on US school grounds, including 15 on college campuses, CNN finds, with at least one person shot in each case, not including the shooter. The deadliest school shooting in modern US history remains the 2007 attack at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg, where a 23-year-old student killed 32 people before dying by suicide.
The shooting at the Charlottesville campus is also one of nearly 600 mass shootings in the US this year, according to the Gun Violence Archive, which like CNN tallies cases in which at least four people are shot, excluding the shooter.
Shooting prompted immediate lockdowns
The attack happened Sunday on a bus returning from a class trip to Washington, DC, where the class had seen a play, university officials said. It was not immediately clear if Jones was part of that class or attended the field trip.
Police responded to a report of shots fired around 10:30 p.m. in an area near a parking garage on Culbreth Road and surrounded by academic buildings, Ryan said. Two slain victims were inside the bus, with the third victim taken to a hospital, where he died, Longo said.
Police on Monday secure the crime scene of an overnight shooting at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville.

The call prompted a shelter-in-place alert that was lifted about 12 hours later, Longo said. More than 500 people sheltered throughout campus buildings, including in libraries and classrooms, he said.
Monday classes at the university were canceled. The school canceled classes Tuesday to “to give “students the opportunity to reflect, mourn and gather with each other,” according to a news release. A family and community assistance center has also been set up on campus to provide UVA community members with mental health services, according to UVA Emergency Management officials.
Classes were also canceled Monday at Charlottesville City Schools, the K-12 district said in a letter to families. A UVA men’s basketball game scheduled for Monday evening has also been canceled, the university said.
In a statement, an attorney for Perry’s parents thanked the communities in both Charlottesville and South Florida – Perry was originally from Miami, the university said – for “the outpouring of support during this impossibly tragic time.
Happy and Sean Perry would not speak publicly at this time about their son’s death, attorney Michael Haggard said, out of respect for the university community, which “has been terrorized by another mass shooting in the United States.”
Suspect had been known to campus police
Jones had come to campus authorities’ attention in September, when authorities found out Jones “had made a comment about possessing a gun” to someone “unaffiliated with the university,” Longo said at Monday’s news conference. But that person never actually saw the gun in question, he said.
Christopher Darnell Jones Jr.
“Through the course of the threat assessment team’s investigation, we learned of a prior criminal incident involving a concealed weapon violation that occurred outside the city of Charlotteville in February of 2021,” Longo said, adding the suspect was required to report that incident to the university but never did. The school’s judicial council took over the case, and the results are pending.
Jones was also involved in a hazing investigation on campus that was closed because witnesses would not cooperate, Longo said.
What we know about the suspect in the deadly University of Virginia shooting
It is “important to share that information with you,” he said, “to let you know that he had been called to our attention.”
Jones is listed on UVA’s athletics website as a football player in 2018 who as a freshman did not participate in any games. He attended Varina High School and Petersburg High School, where he played football as a linebacker and running back, according to his university athletics bio. While in high school, Jones was Key Club president and a member of the National Honor Society and the National Technical Honor Society, the bio says.
A UVA spokesperson told CNN Jones had a pre-existing injury that prevented him from playing on the football team in 2018. Jones went through medical treatment and rehabilitation during his time with the team and was only a member of the team for one season, the spokesperson says.
The spokesperson would not give details on Jones’ injury.
Federal prosecutors working with local authorities
Before the lockdown was lifted, UVA students early Monday were told to “take the shelter in place commands seriously as the situation remains active,” vice president and chief student affairs officer Robyn Hadley said in an email to UVA’s student body.
“We have all received several shelter in place texts, and they are frightening,” Hadley said, adding several police jurisdictions were working to find the suspect. “I am on grounds like many of you; I am sheltering in place and in direct touch with University leadership and UPD … If you are not inside and safe, immediately seek safety.”
Two UVA students who told CNN they were at the scene of the shooting Sunday night and saw part of it unfold described hearing faint popping noises and watching people flee the bus.
The students – both of whom are 21 and did not want to be identified – said they were walking to the gym when they saw the charter bus, still in motion. It was just after 10 p.m. when they heard the popping noises, the students said, but they didn’t think anything of it. The bus was going over a speed bump, they said, but then they saw it stop and saw emergency lights turn on.
4 University of Idaho students found dead in home outside campus in what police are calling a homicide
The bus doors opened, the students said, and they saw people running out. The students told CNN they saw one fall to the ground.
The students hid behind a brick wall in front of the nearby band building before calling 911 around 10:17 p.m., they said. The call wasn’t answered, the students said, but they hung up when they heard sirens in the distance and saw law enforcement arrive.
State and federal prosecutors are helping local agencies in the investigation, according to a joint statement from the US attorney for the Western District of Virginia and commonwealth’s attorneys for Charlottesville and for Albemarle County. The officials pledged to support the investigation and “bring possible charges in the appropriate jurisdiction,” the statement said.
Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin on Monday called the shooting a “horrific tragedy” and praised the work of law enforcement for taking the suspect into custody, according to a tweet. “While there are still many details to uncover, let us lift up the entire community in prayer.” The governor earlier had said Virginia State Police were “fully coordinating” with school and local police.
Vice President Kamala Harris spoke on the shooting shortly after swearing in a new ambassador to Trinidad and Tobago on Monday.
“It’s tragic,” Harris said. “Of course, our prayers are with the families of the victims and it’s just yet a constant reminder that we have to do better in terms of gun safety laws in our country.”
Meantime, another US campus – the University of Idaho – is reeling after police announced a homicide inquiry after officers Sunday discovered four people deceased in a home just outside Moscow campus grounds. The deceased were students, and the cause of their deaths is not yet known, the university confirmed, adding the threat has ended.
Separately, Charlottesville Police arrested a man in connection to “threatening social media posts” against UVA on Monday, but said they don’t believe the threats were tied to the earlier shooting.
“We understand the fear this caused in our community and acted swiftly to resolve this investigation,” a Charlottesville police news release said.
Sunday’s shooting is the University of Virginia’s latest high-profile run-in with violence: White nationalists in August 2017 marched across campus carrying torches and chanting racist slogans. A day later, demonstrators protesting Charlottesville’s plan to remove a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee clashed with counterprotesters, one of whom was killed when a man drove his car into a crowd; that driver is serving life in prison.
A UVA lacrosse player five years earlier was convicted and sentenced to 23 years in prison for the 2010 killing of his ex-girlfriend, Yeardley Love, in her off-campus apartment.

The TSA is ramping up security measures at airports nationwide after admitting to multiple protocol failures that allowed a man to get through a checkpoint with two box cutters. The move comes as passengers are expected to flood airports ahead of Thanksgiving in 10 days.
Here’s what else you need to know to Get Up to Speed and On with Your Day.
(You can get “5 Things You Need to Know Today” delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.)
1. Midterms
After projected victories in close contests in Nevada and Arizona over the weekend, Democrats will keep their Senate majority for the next two years. Retaining Senate control is a huge boost to President Joe Biden and opens a clear path for Senate Democrats to reject bills passed by the House – which means they can set their own agenda. Still, control of the House has yet to be determined as Republicans appear to be inching closer to the 218 seats that would deliver them a majority. These results may take several more days as election workers continue to tally votes in key races that have yet to be called.
2. UVA Shooting
Three people were killed and two others were wounded in a shooting at the University of Virginia’s main campus in Charlottesville on Sunday. The campus was placed on lockdown and the suspect – identified as a school student – remains at large, university president Jim Ryan said in a statement today. Authorities said multiple police departments are actively searching for the suspect, who is listed on the university’s athletics website as a football player in 2018. University officials have urged everyone on campus to immediately seek safety. “We have all received several shelter in place texts, and they are frightening,” UVA vice president Robyn Hadley said in an email to UVA’s student body, adding that the situation remains active.
3. Air show crash
A pair of vintage military planes collided in midair at the Wings Over Dallas airshow Saturday, killing six people on board. In video footage of the crash that was described by Dallas’ mayor as “heartbreaking,” the planes are seen breaking apart in the sky, then hitting the ground within seconds, before bursting into flames. More than 40 fire units responded to the scene at the Dallas Executive Airport after the World War II-era planes – a Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress and a Bell P-63 Kingcobra – went down. The investigation is ongoing but officials said it will be challenging, as neither aircraft was equipped with a flight data recorder, often known as a “black box.”

4. Trump
Former President Donald Trump repeatedly told his onetime White House chief of staff, John Kelly, that he wanted the IRS to investigate his political foes, Kelly told The New York Times. Former FBI Director James Comey and former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, both fierce critics of Trump, were ultimately selected by the IRS for an intensive tax audit. The Times noted earlier this year that the odds of any one person being selected for the audit are about one in 30,600 – raising questions about how two of Trump’s most visible critics were both selected. The IRS previously denied any “politically motivated audits” in a statement to CNN. Still, the head of the IRS has asked a watchdog to investigate the decision to conduct the audits.
5. China
President Biden is meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping today for their first in-person encounter since Biden took office. The stakes for the discussions are high and could have long-lasting consequences for the world’s most important bilateral relationship. But expectations for the meeting are low amid rising US-China tensions. Locked in an intensifying great power rivalry, the US and China disagree with each other on just about every major issue, from Taiwan, the war in Ukraine, North Korea, the transfer of technology, to the shape of the world order. According to a US official, the main objective of the sit-down is not about reaching agreements, but about gaining a better understanding of each other’s priorities and reducing misconceptions.

Remains of missing California mother are found and her ex-husband has been arrested, police say
By Tina Burnside and Susannah Cullinane, CNN
Published 4:53 AM EST, Mon November 14, 2022
Rachel Castillo was reported missing on November 10.
Castillo Family
CNN
 — 
Human remains found in a remote California location are those of a mother reported missing Thursday after a “significant amount of blood” was seen in her home, authorities say.
In a news release, the Simi Valley Police Department said the remains of Rachel Castillo, 25, were discovered in Los Angeles County’s Antelope Valley, and her ex-husband has since been taken into custody.
Castillo was reported missing on November 10 by her sister, who had arrived home at the residence they shared and “found evidence that a struggle occurred inside,” according to Simi Valley police. Castillo was missing but her personal belongings – including her cell phone and car keys – were still at the apartment, police said.
“Based on evidence at the scene, officers suspected that a crime involving serious injury occurred,” the release said. “Detectives have been working continuously since that time to locate Rachel and develop leads in the case.”
California authorities search for missing woman after 'significant amount of blood' was found in her home
Castillo’s ex-husband, Zarbab Ali of Hawthorne, California, is the primary suspect in the case, police said. After the Antelope Valley remains were identified as Castillo, Ali was arrested Sunday afternoon at his parent’s home in Victorville in connection with her homicide, they said.
It is unclear if Ali has an attorney of record at this time.
Rachel’s mother, Robyn Castillo, spoke with CNN Saturday before Rachel’s body was discovered. Robyn described her daughter – who had sons aged 5 and 2 – as a “really great mom to her sons, a good daughter, a good sister, and a good friend.”
Rachel had been studying to become a marriage and family therapist, her mother said. She added that Rachel loves to help people and get them the resources they need.
“It’s been very difficult, we’re just taking it day by day and moment by moment and helping police as much as we can,” Robyn said.

Opinion: Trump is adored by his followers. Dave Chappelle explained why

CNN
 — 
Comedian Dave Chappelle is making headlines for his “Saturday Night Live” monologue in which he joked, among other topics, about Kanye West’s recent antisemitic comments.
Chappelle’s barbs on the subject included tongue-in-cheek advice on how West should have handled the resulting firestorm, and a quip about the decision by sneaker manufacturer Adidas to drop the rapper as a business partner.

But comments he made about former President Donald Trump deserve even more attention than the ones about Ye. And they should serve as a wake-up call for anyone who thinks the former President is going to quietly fade away.
Chappelle pivoted about halfway through his 15-minute opening monologue to the topic of Trump, remarking that “I’m watching the news now, (and) they’re declaring the end of the Trump era.” He then melded his acerbic comedy with a simple truth that everyone wishing Trump would disappear from the political landscape needs to hear: Trump’s base hasn’t come close to abandoning him.
“I’m just being honest with you, I live in Ohio amongst the poor whites,” he said, adding, “A lot of you don’t understand why Trump was so popular (and) … very loved.” Chappelle — who acknowledged in his monologue that he’s a Democrat — then delivered a comedic explanation for why Trump is adored by his followers.
He joked that Trump was an “honest liar” who told the unvarnished truth about a system set up to help the rich and powerful. And he recounted how Trump openly admitted as much during a 2016 campaign debate: “He said, ‘I know the system is rigged because I use it.’ ”
The comedian then joked about how Trump, accused during that debate by Hillary Clinton of not paying taxes, shot back: “That makes me smart.”
Chappelle shared that for many working-class Americans struggling to makes end meet, Trump’s “honesty” in revealing that the rich and powerful have been taking full advantage of a system designed for their benefit only enhanced his stature.
The damage Kanye West is doing is devastating
Now, we can debate all day why people really “love” Trump. Was it for the reasons Chappelle suggested? Or was it that, for some, there is a perverse appeal in his bigotry and defense of white nationalists? Is it his “owning the libs”? His tax cuts that greatly favored the wealthy? It may be a mix of all those reasons — or entirely different ones. But there’s no disputing that in polls taken before last week’s election, Trump was far and away the top choice of Republicans to be their 2024 presidential nominee.
A New York Times/Siena College poll found in mid-October that 49% of Republican voters favored Trump as the party’s 2024 presidential nominee. His closest rival, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, got 26% support. That poll was taken before the GOP came up short in the midterms.
Since then, many in the party are blaming Trump for Republican candidates’ lackluster performance at the ballot box, noting that the high-profile candidates he endorsed lost key, marquee races. Trump’s most notable losses span the country, from US Senate candidates Mehmet Oz in Pennsylvania and Blake Masters in Arizona, to his choices for governor in battleground states such as Michigan and Wisconsin.
Stop obsessing over where trans kids use the bathroom
Still, there is no reason to believe that core Republican voters will be dissuaded from supporting Trump despite last week’s election debacle for which he has been roundly blamed. Trump was still the top 2024 choice of the GOP base despite his botched handling of the response to the Covid-19 pandemic (as polls in 2020 showed), and his role in riling up the crowds responsible for the January 6 attack on the Capitol.
If his base has overlooked all that, it’s hard to imagine that all his supporters will abandon him just because Republicans didn’t get the “red wave” they were expecting.
There’s another deeply concerning reason why Trump’s support will not simply evaporate. As historian and expert on autocracy Ruth Ben-Ghiat explained in a 2021 interview, Trump is an authoritarian leader who has developed a cult-like following. Trump has “followed the authoritarian playbook with propaganda, with corruption, with incitements to violence,” she said. This makes Trump’s bond with his supporters unlike anything we are accustomed to seeing in American politics.
And in an article she penned last year for The Economist, Ben-Ghiat said that Trump’s “influence will not dissipate until the institutions of democracy formally confirm misconduct, for example with a court conviction.” That is why in her view “it is so important to hold Mr. Trump accountable.”

But who knows if Trump will ever be “held accountable” and what the impact would be on his supporters if he ever were to be? Doing so may make his followers cling to him even more tightly — despite what millions of Americans, including even some Republican officeholders, may want.
Given reports that Trump is expected to announce his 2024 presidential run this week, I’d predict that he won’t be going away any time soon, even without having delivered the “red wave” his supporters had so fervently hoped for.

 — 
President Joe Biden held a three-hour talk Monday with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping, their first in-person encounter since Biden took office and an opportunity that both sides appeared to hope would lead to an improvement in rapidly deteriorating relations.
Emerging afterward, Biden told reporters he was “open and candid” with Xi about the range of matters where Beijing and Washington disagree. He cast doubt on an imminent invasion of self-governing Taiwan, and seemed hopeful his message about avoiding all-out conflict was received.
Still, the US president was frank that he and Xi came nowhere near resolving the litany of issues that have helped drive the US-China relationship to its lowest point in decades.
“I’m not suggesting this is kumbaya,” Biden said at a news conference, “but I do not believe there’s a need for concern, as one of you raised a legitimate question, a new Cold War.”
Biden entered Monday’s talks hoping for an opportunity to take stock with Xi of the world’s most important bilateral relationship. He described Xi as not overly confrontational but instead “the way he’s always been: direct and straightforward.”
Biden's past promises for US to defend Taiwan under microscope in meeting with China's Xi
“He was clear, and I was clear that we will defend American interests and values, promote universal human rights and stand up for the international order and work in lockstep with our allies and partners,” Biden said. “We’re going to compete vigorously but I’m not looking for conflict.”
In a sign both men arrived to meeting hoping to improve the souring relationship, Biden announced his Secretary of State Antony Blinken would visit China and said officials from each country would begin working together through issues. Formal talks on climate cooperation between the US and China are expected to resume as well as part of a broader set of agreements between Biden and Xi, two US officials tell CNN.
China previously halted talks – viewed by the Biden administration as a key area where the two nations must work together – as part of retaliation for the visit to Taiwan by Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi. The US and Chinese envoys for climate change are talking, but the Biden administration will see what China is prepared to do to make concrete progress, one of the US officials said.
US Climate Envoy John Kerry’s spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment on whether formal climate talks between the two countries were back on.
The White House said in a statement after the meeting that Biden raised concerns about human rights and China’s provocations around Taiwan. But they found at least one area of apparent agreement – that nuclear weapons cannot be used in Ukraine, where that nation is trying to fight off a Russian invasion.
“President Biden and President Xi reiterated their agreement that a nuclear war should never be fought and can never be won,” a White House readout said, referring to the threat of nuclear weapons use in Ukraine.
Biden did underscore areas of potential cooperation with Xi, including on climate change, in talks that stretched past their expected time at a luxury hotel in Bali.
And he sought to convince Xi that a nuclear armed North Korea was not in China’s interests – particularly because further nuclear or long-range missile tests by Pyongyang could prompt Biden to scale up American military presence in the region.
“It’s difficult to determine whether or not China has the capacity” to convince Kim Jong Un to back off his tests, Biden said. “I’m confident China is not looking for North Korea to engage in further escalatory means.”
‘Good to see you’
The meeting began in the later afternoon with Biden and Xi walking toward each other from opposite sides of a hotel lobby, shaking hands in front of a row of US and Chinese flags. They smiled for cameras and Xi – through a translator – appeared to say, “Good to see you.”
What's at stake for the world's top two economies as Biden and Xi meet
“As leaders of our two nations, we share responsibility, in my view, to show that China and the United States can manage our differences, prevent competition from becoming anything ever nearing conflict and to find ways to work together on urgent global issues that require our mutual cooperation,” Biden said as the talks got underway.
“The world expects, I believe, China and the United States to play key roles in addressing global challenges,” he said.
Speaking second, Xi seemed to offer what could be interpreted as a pointed message to his counterpart, who has spent more than half-a-century on the world stage.
“A statesman should think about and know where to lead his country,” Xi said through a translator. “He should also think about and know how to get along with other countries and the wider world.”
The two leaders’ talks Monday could have consequences stretching months or even years as the world’s largest economies veer toward increasingly hostile relations.
The moments spent together on the sidelines of the Group of 20 summit here will amount to only a fraction of the time the two men have been in each other’s company since 2011. Biden has claimed that as vice president, he spent north of 70 hours with Xi and traveled 17,000 miles with him across China and the United States – both exaggerations, but still reflective of a relationship that is now perhaps the most important on the planet.

China warns US not to cross ‘red line’ over Taiwan
Xi stated that Taiwan is the “first red line” that “must not be crossed” in China-US relations, according to a Chinese foreign ministry readout.
Referring to the “Taiwan question” as the “very core of China’s core interests” and “the bedrock of the political foundation” of China-US relations, Xi stated that peace and stability across the Taiwan strait and “Taiwan independence” is “as irreconcilable as water and fire.”
China’s ruling Communist Party has long claimed the self-ruled democracy of 24 million as an inseparable part of its territory, despite having never ruled over it, and has pledged to take it back – by force if necessary.

In the meeting, Xi stated that basic norms of international relations and the three Sino-US joint communiques – which touches on the Taiwan issue – are the “most important guardrail and safety net” for bilateral relations and are “vitally important” for the two sides to “manage differences and disagreements and prevent confrontation and conflict.”
“We hope that the US side will match its words with action and abide by the one-China policy and the three joint communiques. President Biden has said on many occasions that the US does not support ‘Taiwan independence’ and has no intention to use Taiwan as a tool to seek advantages in competition with China or to contain China. We hope that the US side will act on this assurance to real effect,” according to the readout.
Xi also defended China’s human rights records and governance system, saying that China has “Chinese-style democracy” that fits its national conditions, according to the readout. He acknowledged the differences between China and the US, but stressed that they should not become “an obstacle to growing China-US relations.”
“The Chinese nation has the proud tradition of standing up for itself. Suppression and containment will only strengthen the will and boost the morale of the Chinese people,” the readout said.
A meeting long in the making
The meeting Monday took place at a remarkably low moment in US-China ties. Biden hoped coming face-to-face again after nearly two years communicating only by phone and video-conference can yield a more strategically valuable result, even if he entered the talks with little expectation they would produce anything concrete.
Relations have deteriorated rapidly amid economic disputes and an increasingly militarized standoff over Taiwan. The tensions have led to a decline in cooperation on areas where the two countries once shared common interests, like combating climate change and containing North Korea’s nuclear program.
Biden and Xi return to the table with high stakes -- and low expectations
In a national security strategy document released last month, Biden for the first time identified China as posing “America’s most consequential geopolitical challenge,” and wrote the country was the “only competitor with both the intent to reshape the international order and, increasingly, the economic, diplomatic, military, and technological power to advance that objective.”
There was almost no expectation among American officials that any of those issues could be resolved simply by getting Biden and Xi in the same room. Just arranging the meeting itself required US and Chinese officials to establish lines of communication after Beijing furiously cut off most channels following House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan over the summer.
“Every matter associated with this meeting, from phone calls to logistics, has been very carefully considered, negotiated, and engaged between the two sides,” a senior US administration official said.
Planning for Monday’s meeting predated Pelosi’s trip, and discussions continued between US and Chinese officials despite Beijing’s furor. The process was “serious, very sustained and professional in the best traditions of US-China diplomacy,” the official said.
A second official acknowledged the talks setting up the meeting were not always friendly.
“I won’t say that the conversations weren’t contentious because obviously there’s lots of areas where we have differences and challenges,” the official said. “The dozens of hours we have spent talking to our Chinese counterparts has definitely surfaced many of those issues.”
For his part, Biden takes meetings like this “incredibly seriously” and reads extensively beforehand. In meetings with advisers, he runs through various scenarios for how the meeting might go.
“He goes through ‘if this happens, then should we handle it this way,’” the first official said. “He understands that this is, in many respects, the most important bilateral relationship. And it’s his responsibility to manage it well and he takes that very, very seriously.”
Officials said in Monday’s meeting they expected Biden’s senior-most advisers to accompany him as part of his official delegation. And they said they expected Xi to similarly surround himself with top aides, though the US team entered the meeting expecting to see some new faces on the Chinese side amid an ongoing transition inside Xi’s inner circle.
China's Xi is more powerful than ever. What does it mean for the world?
Biden and Xi entered the meeting with momentum
For Xi, the trip to Bali also marked one of his first journeys abroad since the onset of the Covid pandemic, which prompted the Chinese government to impose strict lock downs and draconian restrictions. Xi’s reemergence on the physical world stage also comes on the heels of China’s Communist Party Congress in Beijing, during which he secured a norm-breaking third term as its leader.
Even a week ago, most inside the White House were expecting Biden to enter the talks comparatively weakened by Democratic losses in the midterm elections. But better-than-expected results for Democrats left the president feeling as if he was entering his meetings this week with the wind at his back, according to top aides.
“I know I’m coming in stronger, but I don’t need that,” Biden said of his own improved political fortunes on Saturday.
US officials previewing the meeting have stressed the Biden administration is not looking to come out of it with specific “deliverables,” including a joint statement listing areas of potential cooperation. Rather, the setting is aimed at offering both Biden and Xi a significant opportunity to better share their respective countries’ goals and perspectives.
“Xi is not an enigma to President Biden,” a senior administration official told CNN. “He knows him. And he is mindful of where Xi is trying to take China. He sees China as a competitor, and he feels confident the US can win that competition.”
China’s pandemic-era isolation, US officials say, had made it relatively harder in recent years to get a read on Beijing’s intentions abroad as Xi declined to travel outside of China – but they believe that is all about to change.
“We can expect them to be more assertive on the world stage,” the senior administration said. But, they added: “What that looks like is difficult to know right now.”
Sullivan said this week that finally substituting the pandemic-era video calls with a face-to-face meeting for the first time since Biden took office “takes the conversation to a different level strategically and allows the leaders to explore in deeper detail what each of them see in terms of their intentions and priorities.”

New York Times: Trump sought tax investigations of political foes
By Paul LeBlanc, CNN
Published 11:30 PM EST, Sun November 13, 2022

Washington
CNN
 — 
Former President Donald Trump repeatedly told his onetime White House chief of staff, John Kelly, that he wanted the Internal Revenue Service to investigate his political foes, Kelly told The New York Times.
Among the people Trump wanted to “get the I.R.S. on” were former FBI Director James Comey and former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, Kelly told the newspaper.
“I would say, ‘It’s inappropriate, it’s illegal, it’s against their integrity and the I.R.S. knows what it’s doing and it’s not a good idea,’” Kelly said he told Trump, according to the Times.
“Yeah, but they’re writing bad things about me,” Trump responded, according to Kelly.
McCabe and Comey, both fierce critics of Trump, were ultimately selected by the Internal Revenue Service for an intensive tax audit. The Times noted earlier this year that the odds of any one person being selected for the audit are about one in 30,600, raising questions about how two of Trump’s most visible critics were both selected.
The IRS denied any “politically motivated audits” in a statement to CNN earlier this year, and Kelly told the Times he believes that he guided Trump away from seeking out such investigations during his tenure as chief of staff.
Still, the head of the IRS, Charles Rettig, asked a watchdog to investigate the decision to conduct audits on the pair earlier this year.
McCabe, now a CNN law enforcement analyst, was one of the central leaders of the early Russia investigation that pursued Trump’s advisers and questions about whether the then-president had obstructed justice.
In March 2018, two days shy of McCabe’s scheduled retirement date, then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions fired him from the FBI.
Trump and Comey had a similarly tumultuous relationship. In a stunning move, Trump fired Comey as FBI director in May 2017, triggering the appointment of a special counsel. Trump has called Comey a “liar” and “leaker” and suggested that his actions were treasonous. Comey has bashed Trump as a stain on American democracy.
“It just defies logic to think that there wasn’t some other factor involved,” McCabe told CNN’s Laura Coates in July of his purportedly random selection for the audit, which he characterized as an “incredibly rigorous” and “nerve-wracking” process.
“I think that’s a reasonable question. I think it should be investigated. People need to be able to trust the institutions of government and so that’s why there should be some – we should dig through this and find out what happened,” he continued.

 — 
A suspect is in custody related to an explosion that killed at least six people and injured at least 81 others in Istanbul on Sunday, Turkey’s interior ministry said early Monday.
The incident has been deemed a terrorist attack, Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay said Sunday, according to state news agency Anadolu.
“We consider it to be a terrorist act as a result of an attacker, whom we consider to be a woman, detonating the bomb,” Oktay told reporters Sunday.
Turkish officials believe Kurdish separatists from the Kurdistan Worker’s Party (PKK) and the Democratic Union Party (PYD) were most likely behind the deadly suspected bomb attack, the country’s interior minister, Suleyman Soylu, told reporters Monday.
“It is PKK/PYD terrorist organization according to our preliminary findings,” Soylu said in a press conference at the scene of Sunday’s attack on Istiklal Avenue, Istanbul.
Soylu did not elaborate or provide details of how investigators had reached this conclusion.
“A little while ago the person who left the bomb (was) taken under custody by teams of Istanbul Police Department. Before their arrest 21 more people were also taken under custody,” the minister said. “The face of terrorism is bitter, but we will continue this struggle to the end, whatever the cost is.”
CCTV footage shows a woman sitting on a bench for more than 40 minutes and then getting up one or two minutes before the explosion, leaving a bag or plastic bag behind, according to Turkish Justice Minister Bekir Bozdag.
Bozdag, who made the comments in an interview with privately owned A Haber news channel, said Turkish security forces believe the woman is the suspect, and officials are investigating her.
“There are two possibilities. Either that bag or plastic bag has a mechanism in it, it explodes on its own or someone detonates it from afar. All of these are currently under investigation.” he added.
“The name of the woman is unknown,” he said. “All the recordings and data about the woman are being analyzed.”

The blast happened on Istiklal Street in Beyoglu Square, in the heart of Turkey’s largest city, Istanbul Governor Ali Yerlikaya said.
“We wish God’s mercy on those who lost their lives and a speedy recovery to the injured,” Yerlikaya tweeted.

The six people killed include Yusuf Meydan, a member of Turkey’s Ministry of Family and Social Services, and his daughter Ecrin, according to Derya Yanık, the minister of the agency.
Soylu, the interior minister, said Monday that 50 of the 81 people injured have been discharged from the hospital, with 31 people still being treated.
Turkey’s conflict with Kurdish separatist groups has spanned four decades and claimed tens of thousands of lives. The PKK has been designated a terrorist organization by Turkey, the United States and the European Union.
“In particular, the insincerity of our so-called allies who seem friendly to us, who either hide terrorists in their own country, or feeds terrorists in the areas they occupy and send them money from their own senates, is obvious,” Soylu said.
“We will give them a response in the near future, to those who caused us this pain in Beyoglu Istiklal Street so they experience more and more pain,” Soylu said.
‘What looked like the aftermath of a war zone’
Witness Tariq Keblaoui said he was shopping on Istiklal Street when the explosion happened about 10 meters (32.8 feet) ahead of him.
“People were scattering immediately,” said Keblaoui, a Lebanese-based journalist who was on his last day of vacation in the city.
Turkish police and explosives experts work the scene of the explosion Sunday.

“Very shortly after, I could see how many injured were on the ground,” Keblaoui told CNN. He says he saw dead bodies and victims who were seriously injured.
“There was a man in the store bleeding from his ears and his legs, and his friends were crying near him,” Keblaoui said.
Police officers secure the area after the explosion.

Istiklal Street was packed with visitors when the blast happened Sunday afternoon, he said.
“It went very quickly from a very peaceful Sunday with a very crowded street full of tourists to being what looked like the aftermath of a war zone,” Keblaoui said.
Countries unite in condemning the attack
News of the explosion led to a torrent of condolences from around the world.
French President Emmanuel Macron, whose own country suffered a deadly terror attack exactly seven years earlier, shared his sympathies for the Turkish people.

“On this day so symbolic for our Nation, while we think of the victims who fell on November 13, 2015, the Turkish people are struck by an attack in their heart, Istanbul,” Macron tweeted Sunday. “To the Turks: we share your pain. We stand with you in the fight against terrorism.”
European Council President Charles Michel shared his condolences after Sunday’s deadly blast.

“Horrific news from Istanbul tonight,” he said. “All our thoughts are with those currently responding and the people of Türkiye at this very distressing time.”
NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg tweeted his “deepest condolences” to the Turkish people, adding that NATO “stands in solidarity with our ally” Turkey.

The United States “strongly condemns the act of violence that took place today in Istanbul,” White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Sunday. “Our thoughts are with those who were injured and our deepest condolences go to those who lost loved ones.”
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky tweeted of his “deep sadness” at the news of the blast. “I offer my condolences to the families of those who lost their lives and wish a speedy recovery to the injured,” Zelensky said. “The pain of the friendly Turkish people is our pain.”

How a NASA scientist and a record-breaking mountaineer conquered an unknown mountain to raise money for girls’ education

 — 
Exploring the peaks of the world’s highest mountains or the secrets of space’s deepest labyrinths has become almost second nature for Poorna Malavath and Kavya Manyapu.
It has taken Manyapu to NASA where her research has included designing space suits, and Malavath to the top of Mount Everest when in 2014, she became the youngest ever woman to summit the world’s highest mountain at just 13 years old.
Now, these two women have channeled their exploring spirit into climbing some of the world’s most difficult mountains as part of their campaign, Project Shakthi, which raises money to fund girls’ education.
At the end of August, they climbed a 6,012m virgin peak in Ladakh, India – one previously unmapped and untouched by human expeditions – aiming to use the symbolism of blazing a trail both literally and metaphorically.
Never climbed before, the mountain presented difficult challenges for even an experienced mountaineer like Malavath, for there were neither trails to follow nor advice from previous climbers to cling to.
“We have to prepare ourselves mentally to accept everything,” Malavath explains to CNN Sport. “So it is completely different and it has given me so much more knowledge to guide others.”
Every member of the team experienced some form of altitude sickness ascending the virgin peak, given the altitude at which they were climbing.
Project Shakthi Team
Rainy weather conditions that turned to snow at high altitude added to the complexities of climbing a virgin peak.
“The night when we were planning to leave for our summit bit, it actually snowed at our high camp, which meant avalanche conditions on the mountain we wanted to climb that day,” Manyapu recalls to CNN.
“We had to rapidly come back as a team, make a safety call and then prepare for the next day. So it was very challenging.”
And for a relatively inexperienced climber like Manyapu, though she had trained extensively, the challenges were even greater.
“Poorna and I several times when we were in the tent, we would talk about: ‘What if, you know, we won’t be able to make it to the summit, you know, what if this? What if that?’” Manyapu says.
“But then we would always like go back and encourage each other and motivate each other that, you know, let’s just take it one step at a time.”
‘I’ve always been inspired by her story’
In the group’s darkest moments on the trek, they found motivation in Project Shakthi’s purpose and its tagline: ‘We climb so that girls can read,’ a deeply personal cause for both Malavath and Manyapu.
Reflecting during the Covid-19 pandemic on her own childhood during which her family moved from India to the United States “to help fulfill her dreams,” Manyapu realized that she could help girls without the same support system to also access opportunities.
“I have a three-year-old daughter, so when I look at her, I feel like it’s my responsibility to make the world at least one percent better for her and her generation,” she adds.
Manyapu comes from the same village in India as Malavath, but the two women met for the first time in 2019, when Manyapu was pregnant with her daughter.
“I’ve always been inspired by [Malavath’s] story since 2014,” Manyapu says. “I called her up and I said this is something I want to start an initiative where we could climb for a cause.
“We’ve done things for our passion so far, but how about taking our passion to serve a purpose of empowering, educating and elevating underprivileged school children?”
When Malavath embarked on her climb up Mount Everest as a 13-year-old, she was unaware about the problems of inequality which rack society.
“As I continued climbing the seven continents’ highest mountains, I came to know about that society,” she says. “And there are many girls who are struggling in rural areas and they aren’t getting any kind of opportunities.
“I always think about the students who are studying with me and the people who are in the villages… One of my friends got married at like 14 or 15 years, and now she has two kids and they are going to school. And I just finished my education.”
Malavath and Manyapu hold up their Project Shakthi logo at the summit.

On that climb up Everest, Malavath recalls vomiting from the exertion, remaining stuck on the expedition for “like 50 days because of weather” and being determined to summit the mountain.
“When I got an opportunity to climb Mount Everest, it was a different aim to prove that girls can do anything,” she says. “Then after that, I became a mountain lover maybe because mountains have taught me so much.”
As well as raising money for education, the project will aim to change the mindset about what women can accomplish and elevate stories that can serve as role models.
As part of this, Project Shakthi will partner with the US-based AVS Academy to pair student volunteers with girls sponsored by the organization so that they can receive one-on-one mentorship.
“I think we both together bring a story that really would help them see that what a person can do, what a girl can do,” Manyapu says. “Because I believe representation matters. And while we are at a generation where we do see women in various fields, we still have a lot of gender gap to close.”
Since August 2009, when the Indian parliament passed the landmark Right to Education Act that made education free and compulsory for all children under 14, the number of girls in school has increased, though the national averages obscure variations across the states, according to the country’s Annual Status of Education Report.
Around the world, while enrollment rates are almost equal between genders, the completion rates are still disparate – according to the World Bank, only 36% of girls complete lower secondary school compared to 44% of boys in what it calls low-income countries.
And to tackle this global issue, Project Shakthi has set its sights on broadening its goals.
Manyapu and Malavath were accompanied by a team on their expedition.
Project Shakthi Team
Manyapu and Malavath will climb Mount Aconcagua, the highest mountain in South America at 6,961 meters, in December as part of the next phase of Project Shakthi, inviting people interested in climbing to join them.
In the meantime, the project has already begun selecting girls who will receive its sponsorship through the $12,000 it has raised so far.
“Poorna and I actually visited our village back in India right after we completed our expedition of the virgin peak,” Manyapu says. “And we are starting in our village because that’s where our roots are.”
Eventually, the project will aim to sponsor girls across the globe, empowering them and exposing them to opportunities that would otherwise remain hidden, as Malavath and Manyapu continue their mission so that girls can have an education.

Pence calls Trump tweet on January 6 ‘reckless’

 — 
Former Vice President Mike Pence said former President Donald Trump’s words on social media during the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol were “reckless” and criticized Trump for being “part of the problem” that day.
Pence was asked on ABC News about Trump’s tweet during the attack that said Pence didn’t have the “courage” to unilaterally overturn the results.
“It angered me,” Pence told ABC’s David Muir after a long pause. “But I turned to my daughter, who was standing nearby. And I said, ‘It doesn’t take courage to break the law, it takes courage to uphold the law.’ The president’s words were reckless. It was clear he decided to be part of the problem,” the former vice president continued in one of his strongest rebukes of his former boss to date.
In the Trump White House, Pence was fiercely loyal in public through the constant controversies that defined the administration, but in the wake of the January 6 riot – in which Trump supporters chanted to hang the then-vice president – he has occasionally criticized his former boss, most notably in February, when he publicly denounced Trump’s election lies.
“President Trump is wrong,” Pence said at the time, referring to the false claim that Pence, in his capacity as vice president, had the authority to unilaterally reject Electoral College votes. “I had no right to overturn the election.”
Trump, for his part, has said Pence “very greatly disappointed me” on the day the electoral votes were certified.
The former vice president has been coy about his plans for 2024. He has long been viewed as a potential aspirant for the Republican presidential nomination, but has not formally declared a bid and would almost certainly face strong opposition from Trump, whose supporters he would need in a primary fight. Trump is set to announce his 2024 campaign on Tuesday, former adviser Jason Miller said in a podcast appearance.
Throughout the midterm season, Trump and Pence had occasionally found themselves in a proxy fight, supporting opposing candidates in Arizona, Georgia and Wisconsin. Trump campaigned with a slate of candidates who have parroted his lies about widespread fraud in the 2020 election as Pence attempted to steer the GOP’s focus away from relitigating 2020 and toward traditional conservative policies.
Still, Pence has been careful not to completely tear himself away from Trump.
“You know, what I can tell you is I have every confidence that the Republican Party is going to sort out leadership,” Pence said last month, adding that his focus was on the midterm elections.
“But after that, we’ll be thinking about the future, ours and the nation’s.”
Pence is set to participate in a CNN town hall on Wednesday, the day after the release of his forthcoming autobiography “So Help Me God.” The town hall, moderated by CNN Anchor and Chief Washington Correspondent Jake Tapper, will take place in New York City and is scheduled for 9 p.m. ET.
This story has been updated with additional information Sunday.

My son has been asking for a dress. I finally decided to just get him dresses despite being afraid he’d get teased by other kids. Today, the boy next door asked why he was wearing a dress, I said “he wanted one” and he said “okay” then they continued to play. The kids are alright

"Kherson man shows CNN the cell Russian forces kept him in 06:21
November 14, 2022 Russia-Ukraine news
By Rhea Mogul, Jack Guy, Aditi Sangal, Elise Hammond and Maureen Chowdhury, CNN
Updated 12:25 a.m. ET, November 15, 2022
What we covered here
President Volodymyr Zelensky made an unannounced visit to Kherson Monday to celebrate Ukraine's recapture of the strategic southern city.
Kherson is now a frontline city in the war in Ukraine after Russian forces withdrew from the region west of the Dnipro River late last week. A CNN crew saw joyful scenes in the city following the pullback.
Ukrainian officials are restoring key services in parts of the region, but the military warns that Russian attacks are a present danger even in liberated areas.
The G20 summit begins this week, and it's not yet clear whether Russian President Vladimir Putin will attend virtually — or how Western leaders would react.

Zelensky visits newly-retaken Kherson city, says ""we are going forward""

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky visited the formerly Russian-occupied city of Kherson on Monday.
In a video circulating on Telegram, Zelensky told a group of reporters that he thought it was necessary to visit the city.
“The military takes risks every day, journalists take risks,” he said. “I think it is necessary to be here and talk about Kherson residents, to support people. To make them feel that we are not only talking about it, but we are really returning, really raising our flag.”
“I would also like, in a human way, to get the emotion, the energy from people. It is motivating.”
Zelensky said that “peace for our country is all our country, all our territory.”
“We are step by step coming to our country, to all the temporarily occupied territories,” he told the media during an unannounced visit to the city. “And of course it’s a pity, but it’s a long way, a difficult way, because this war took the best heroes of our country.”
“We are going forward. We are ready for peace. But our peace for our country is all our country, all our territory,"" added Zelensky.
""We respect the law and respect sovereignty of all the countries. But now we are speaking about our country. That’s why we are fighting against Russian aggression.”
Some context: Crowds have been celebrating the liberation of Kherson city after Ukrainian forces swept into the regional capital and Russian troops retreated to the east on Friday.
But life remains far from normal, with authorities warning residents to be wary of explosives littering the city, and Russian forces still nearby — just across the strategically important Dnipro River.

Ukraine claims 12 Luhansk settlements recaptured since start of counteroffensive
Ukrainian forces have recaptured 12 settlements in Luhansk since initiating a counteroffensive in September, the top Ukrainian official for the eastern region said Monday.
“The advance is not easy,” said Serhiy Hayday, head of the Luhansk regional military administration, on national television. “Every meter passed in the Luhansk region is a continuous struggle for the AFU [Armed Forces of Ukraine].”
The Ukrainian military began a slow probe into the Luhansk region in September, after a rapid advance in the neighboring Kharkiv region.
The village of Makiivka was liberated Sunday, according to the military administration, and Ukrainian forces have in recent weeks been pushing towards the road connecting Svatove and Kreminna. For several weeks, they have said that the road is under their ""fire control,"" meaning that the Russian military can only use it with a high risk of coming under fire.
“There is heavy fighting in Luhansk region every day,” Hayday said. “The recently de-occupied settlements are being heavily shelled.”
“The occupiers know exactly where they are firing, as they were knocked out of these settlements a few days ago and they know how many civilians are there and where they are. That is why we are trying to establish evacuation.”

""I am not afraid of the dark anymore"": Orphaned Ukrainian boy finds hope with new family
From CNN's Salma Abdelaziz and Dennis Lapin in Kyiv

When Russian forces invaded their country in late February, Vladimir Bespalov and Maria Bespalaya feared their long-held dream of starting a family through adoption was over.
“I remember that morning of Feb. 24, very clearly,” said Vladimir Bespalov, a 27-year-old railroad worker, of the first day of the war. “We thought we were too late. We realized we were already in a state of war, and we thought we could no longer adopt.”
Instead, the situation pushed the couple to try to do it sooner, he said. “We were waiting to earn more money, have a better car, buy a house, and build something to give our children first. But when the war started, we thought why not adopt a child now and accomplish these things together as a family.”
That day, the married couple, who were living in eastern Ukraine, posted an appeal on social media.
“We want to adopt any boy or girl, any newborn or child,” it read.
Weeks later that message would reach a volunteer helping those fleeing Mariupol, a southern city that became emblematic of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s ruthless campaign to take Ukrainian land, no matter the cost.
Residents were forced underground for weeks while Russian troops pummeled the city with artillery. It is now a virtual wasteland, with nearly every building damaged or destroyed, and an unknown number of dead beneath the rubble.
Among the survivors was 6-year-old Ilya Kostushevich, orphaned and alone. Both his parents were killed in the first week of the war.
His mother was struck down by Russian artillery after she left home to find food for her family, Bespalov and Bespalaya were later to learn from police.
Unaware of his wife’s fate, Ilya’s father went looking for her the next day, only to be killed by shelling from Moscow’s army, too, police said.
Little Ilya has told how he was left at a neighbor’s house, where he sheltered in a cold, dark basement with strangers for weeks.
He got so hungry he started to eat his toys, Bespalaya said.

Ukraine's military warns Russia may increase attacks in liberated Kherson

The Ukrainian military on Monday warned that Russia may be planning to step up attacks on newly liberated parts of the southern Kherson region.
“The enemy is intensifying aerial reconnaissance, which may indicate that they are planning to strike at both military and civilian targets,” the Ukrainian military’s General Staff said in its regular update on Monday.
On Sunday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky warned the situation in Kherson ""is still very dangerous,"" adding that the “detention of Russian soldiers and mercenaries who were left behind, and neutralization of saboteurs, are also ongoing.”
In its update Monday, the General staff said the threat from mines ""remains high"" in liberated parts of Kherson.
“Units of the Defense Forces continue to carry out stabilization measures,” it said.
The warning comes after a family of four, including an 11-year-old child, were injured in an explosion after their car hit a mine in Kherson on Sunday, according to Ukrainian officials.
2:18 a.m. ET, November 14, 2022
Mine explosion injures family of 4 in Kherson, Ukrainian official says
A family of four people traveling by car was injured in a mine explosion Sunday in an area of the southern Kherson region formerly occupied by Russian troops, according to a top Ukrainian official.
Kyrylo Tymoshenko, deputy head of the President’s Office, said an 11-year-old child was among those wounded.
""Russian terrorists left behind a lot of mines and tripwires,"" Tymoshenko said in a Telegram post. ""We tirelessly ask people to be cautious and refrain from traveling on those roads that have not yet been checked by experts.""
Some context: On Saturday, crowds celebrated the liberation of Kherson city after Ukrainian forces swept into the regional capital and Russian troops retreated to the east. But life remains far from normal, with authorities warning residents to be wary of explosives littering the city, and Russian forces still nearby — just across the strategically important Dnipro River.

The mayor of the southern Ukrainian city of Melitopol, Ivan Fedorov, says Russian forces have turned the city into a ""huge military base"" while under their occupation.
Melitopol has been held by Russian forces since the early days of the invasion. 
“Russians turned captured Melitopol and the Melitopol district into a huge military complex,” Fedorov wrote in a Telegram post on Sunday. “Columns of occupiers are arriving in Melitopol both from the Kherson side and from the side of the temporarily occupied city of Tokmak in Zaporizhzhia region.” 
“Fortifications are being built around the perimeter of the city of Melitopol,” he added. “The Russian military is settling in local houses they seized, schools and kindergartens. Military equipment is stationed in residential areas.” 
Fedorov also reported that “civilians are prohibited from approaching the area of the Melitopol airfield.”

Investigators have uncovered more than 400 cases of alleged Russian war crimes in the Kherson region since the exit of Moscow's forces from the area, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Sunday.
“Investigators have already documented more than 400 Russian war crimes, the bodies of both civilians and military personnel are being found,"" Zelensky said in his nightly address.
“In the Kherson region, the Russian army left behind the same atrocities as in other regions of our country where it was able to enter.”
The president added that “detention of Russian soldiers and mercenaries who were left behind, and neutralization of saboteurs, are also ongoing.”
Zelensky warned “the situation in the Kherson region is still very dangerous.”
“First of all, there are mines. Unfortunately, one of our sappers was killed, and four others were injured while clearing mines,” he said.
Zelensky was echoing warnings voiced by a local Ukrainian official earlier Sunday, who told Kherson region residents to beware of encounters with Russian soldiers and to look out for mines or missile strikes from Moscow's military.

Ukrainian military says it has liberated 179 settlements on the west bank of the Dnipro River
From CNN's Mariya Knight
The Ukrainian military says it has liberated 179 settlements on the west bank of the Dnipro River in the past week.
Meanwhile, military spokesman Vladyslav Nazarov says the Russians ""continue defensive operations and the construction of fortifications on the left (east) bank"" of the river.
According to Nazarov, Russians have “14 ships on combat duty and one missile carrier equipped with eight cruise missiles ready for use” stationed in the Black Sea. 
“In the Sea of Azov, the enemy continues to control sea communications by keeping one ship on combat duty, and in the Mediterranean Sea, there are 10 enemy ships on combat duty, 5 of them carrying Kalibr cruise missiles, with a total salvo of 76 missiles,” the Navy of the Armed Forces of Ukraine said on Facebook Sunday.

Residents of the newly liberated city of Kherson are almost without water and face shortages of bread and medicines, officials warned, as efforts continued Sunday to remove mines and restore critical infrastructure following the withdrawal of Russian forces.
Crowds celebrated the liberation of Kherson on Saturday after Ukrainian forces swept into the city and Russian troops retreated to the east.
But life remains far from normal, with authorities warning residents to be wary of explosives littering the city, and Russian forces still nearby — just across the strategically important Dnipro River.
This is not the end of the struggle against the Russian occupation in the country, reports CNN's Nic Robertson, who witnessed emotional scenes Saturday in Kherson’s central square as residents hailed their liberation.
“Kherson is now a frontline city,” he said. “Last night and in the early hours of this morning you could hear outgoing fire towards the Russian forces.”

Police identify 4 University of Idaho students found dead outside campus
By Chris Boyette and Hannah Sarisohn, CNN
Updated 6:47 PM EST, Mon November 14, 2022

 — 
Four University of Idaho students who were found dead Sunday night in a house near campus have been identified, the city of Moscow’s police department said Monday.
The slain students were 20-year-old Ethan Chapin of Conway, Washington; 21-year-old Madison Mogen of Coeur d’Alene, Idaho; 20-year-old Xana Kernodle of Avondale, Arizona; and 21-year-old Kaylee Goncalves of Rathdrum, Idaho.
Moscow police said they are investigating the deaths as homicides, but did not provide any other information about what happened. As of midday Monday, no suspect was in custody. Anyone with information about the case has been asked to contact police.
“The Moscow Police Department and the City of Moscow is deeply saddened for the families of these individuals, fellow students and friends, and our community during this time,” the police department said. “Our heartfelt sympathies go out to each and every person affected by this incident.”
Moscow Mayor Art Bettge called the students’ deaths “senseless acts of violence.”
“This tragedy serves as a sobering reminder that senseless acts of violence can occur anywhere, at any time, and we are not immune from such events here in our community,” the mayor said. “Today, we grieve for those were lost and those they leave behind. Let us come together in support of each other, and be there for each other, as we mourn as a community.”
3 dead, 2 others wounded in University of Virginia shooting as police search for suspect
Police have indicated “there is no ongoing threat,” the university tweeted Sunday without elaborating.
Officers responded to a call about an unconscious person shortly before noon Sunday and discovered the four bodies, the Moscow Police Department said in a news release.
“It is with deep sadness that I share with you that the university was notified today of the death of four University of Idaho students living off-campus believed to be victims of homicide,” university president Scott Green said in a statement to the campus community.
The slain students were also involved on campus, according to the university. Chapin was a freshman majoring in recreation, sport, and tourism management who was also a member of Sigma Chi fraternity. CNN has reached out to Sigma Chi.
Kernodle was a junior majoring in marketing and was also a member of Pi Beta Phi sorority, the university said. CNN has reached out to Phi Beta Phi.
Mogen was a senior majoring in marketing and Goncalves was a senior majoring in general studies, according to the university.
Counseling will be provided on campus for students and employees through Tuesday, the school said.
The tragic discovery came as another US college campus – the University of Virginia in Charlottesville – is reeling as three students were fatally shot Sunday. The alleged gunman, identified as a UVA student, was been taken into custody Monday morning after an hourslong manhunt.
At the University of Idaho, in-person and online classes Monday are canceled and set to resume Tuesday.
“We are grateful for the support of the community and the ongoing efforts of the Police Department. The university is committed to supporting students and families during this difficult time,” Green said.
CNN has reached out to the university and to the police department for more details.
CNN’s Hannah Sarisohn, Holly Yan and Susannah Cullinane contributed to this report.

Billionaire Elon Musk said on Monday he was working “at the absolute most amount … from morning til night, seven days a week” when asked about his recent acquisition of Twitter and his leadership of automaker Tesla.
“I have too much work on my plate that is for sure,” Musk said by videolink to a business conference on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Bali.
Elon Musk heads to court over Tesla pay that made him the world's richest person
Musk, who is chief executive of both companies, appeared lit by candles, wearing a batik shirt sent by the organizers and said he was speaking from a place that had just lost power.
The question of whether Tesla (TSLA) will suffer because Musk is preoccupied with Twitter has become a focus for investors and analysts.
Indonesia has been trying to secure a deal with Tesla on battery investment and potentially for Elon Musk’s SpaceX aerospace company to develop a rocket launch site.
Musk made no commitment to either of those but said Indonesia had a large role to play in the electric vehicle supply chain and that it would make sense “long term” for SpaceX to have multiple launch points around the globe.

Understanding and supporting the transgender community
By Christopher Dawson, CNN
Updated 9:21 AM EST, Mon November 14, 2022
Angela Weiss/AFP/Getty Images
CNN
 — 
Transgender Awareness Week is an annual observance spotlighting issues transgender people face. Here are just a few ways you can help foster understanding, recognition and support for a community facing steep challenges.
A difficult path to walk alone
Transgender adults experience higher levels of depression and anxiety than their peers with 41% of transgender adults having attempted suicide compared to less than 2% of the general population. A 2019 National Survey on LGBTQ Youth Mental Health found that more than half of transgender and non-binary youth have seriously considered suicide. A 2021 Williams Institute study reports 30% of transgender youth have attempted suicide in the past year.
If you or someone you know is transgender and needs to talk, here are some of the resources available.
The Trans Lifeline can be reached in the US at 1-877-565-8860 and in Canada at 1-877-330-6366
The LGBT National Hotline is available at 1-888-843-4564. They also provide a LGBT Senior Hotline at 1-888-234-7243 and LGBTQ Youth can call 1-800-246-7743 or join youth chat rooms here.
The Trevor Project crises counselors can be reached at 1-866-488-7386. Text ‘START’ to 678-678 to connect via text message, or chat online here.
The SAGE LGBT Elder Hotline can be reached at 1-877-360-5428
Dial 988 to reach the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. They also provide a Lifeline Chat here, and additional LGBTQ resources here.
Text ‘HOME’ to 741741 to connect with crises counselors at Crises Text Line. To connect to their counselors on WhatsApp, click here.
The Williams Institute study also shows a significant drop in suicidal thoughts when there is support and acceptance from families, classmates and coworkers. But finding ways to be supportive can be hard, especially for potential allies who are struggling to understand and accept transgender people in their lives. Here are some resources to help.
Transfamilies host free virtual parent support groups on zoom. The available sessions can be found here.
Trans Lifeline Friends & Family call-back service has counselors available. Schedule a call at 1-877-565-8860.
Gender Spectrum provides free online groups for family members, parents and caregivers here.
Transfamily Support Services offers free virtual support groups and family engagement sessions here.
PFLAG’s Straight for Equality program provides learning sessions to train trans allies in the workplace.
Facing violence for being transgender
Deadly attacks on Black trans women are going up. This grieving mom is fighting back
Transgender Awareness week ends with the Transgender Day of Remembrance on November 20th, which honors the lives lost to anti-transgender violence. 2021 was the deadliest year on record for the community, with the Human Rights Campaign recording 50 transgender and non-conforming people killed. Transgender people are also more than four times likely to be victims of violent crime than cisgender people, according to a study from the UCLA School of Law. And the Office for Victims of Crime reports that at some point in their lives, one out of every two transgender people are sexually abused or assaulted.
These resources and groups focus on helping protect the transgender population from violence.
The Anti-Violence Project offers a free 24-hour bilingual crisis intervention hotline. Call or text 1-212-714-1141 to report violence anonymously, connect to counseling, or get safety guidance and legal help. You can also report violence online here.
The National Domestic Violence Hotline is available at 1-800-799-7233 or by chat here. Their advocates can also provide LGBTQ resources and help create a safety plan.
The RAINN National Sexual Assault Hotline is 1-800-656-4673. They also provide an online hotline. Their website offers support for LGBTQ survivors of Sexual Violence.
FORGE provides resources for transgender victims of crime and violence, and a guide for partners and friends of transgender sexual violence survivors.
Fatal transgender violence is on the rise, but this group wants to help
Discrimination and loss of rights
2021 was also a record-breaking year for anti-transgender legislation. These bills restrict access to bathrooms, locker rooms and participation in sports. Some prohibit gender-affirming health care and others try to force educators to refer to transgender students by their “biological sex” and restricting LGBTQ teaching materials. Politicians pushing many of these bills have villainized the transgender population in their culture war, marginalizing them even further.
These organizations provide resources and support to help transgender people respond when their rights are infringed.
The Transgender Law Center Help Desk lists helpful resources by issue area and has an online submission form for specific questions.
The Transgender Legal Defense & Education Fund’s Trans Health Project helps transgender and non-binary people understand the trans-related health care available, and the steps to get the care they need.
Transathlete compiles athletic policies on trans inclusion by location and sport division for athletes, coaches and administrators.
Republicans build momentum as they drive anti-LGBTQ legislation nationwide
These are just some of the challenges facing members of the transgender community. Learning more about their lives is a first step to being there for them. The GLAAD report “Understanding issues facing Transgender Americans” provides a look at the obstacles they face.

 — 
Between warnings of a recession, high inflation and layoff fears, the news is bleak. Why not have some chocolate?
Chocolate makers are reporting booming sales as stressed out customers reach for something sweet to take the edge off.
In the third quarter, sales of Hershey’s (HSY) chocolates, which include Reese’s, Kit Kat and Hershey bars, jumped 12.6% in retail. Mondelez (MDLZ), the global snack brand that makes Toblerone, Cadbury and others, said its chocolate sales grew 9.3% in the quarter.
Chocolate, like many comfort foods, got a boost during the pandemic. But unlike other categories such as pizza, where interest fell off as employees returned to the office and kids went back to school, chocolate is still growing — thanks in part to demand from stressed out consumers.
“Chocolate grew in 2020 and has maintained that growth, something many industries were not able to do,” according to a 2022 report from the research firm Mintel. “Increased at-home occasions, the need for fun and relief from stress, and the availability and convenience of chocolate all contributed to this upward trajectory.”
In the year through October 30, chocolate sales hit $17.7 billion in US retail, according to data from market research firm IRI, up from $14.6 billion for the year in 2019.

One reason for the growth is higher prices for groceries and snacks, including chocolate. The increase isn’t affecting sales too much — shoppers are not that sensitive to changes in the price of chocolate, said Dan Sadler, principal of client insights at IRI, who has expertise in the confections market and tracks price sensitivity.
In the second quarter, IRI found that elasticity for chocolate was about -.4. That means that a 10% increase in prices would result in only a 4% drop in sales by volume, Sadler explained.
“You can raise that price, and you’ll see a little bit of a hit to volume, but not a whole lot, not like you will in some other categories,” he said.
How America turned into a nation of snackers
Even chocolate makers have been surprised by how well demand is holding up.
Elasticity “remains below expectations,” said Mondelez CEO Dirk Van de Put during a recent analyst call discussing the company’s third-quarter results, lower even than before Covid. “We see consumers saying that chocolate is really something they cannot live without.”
Hershey raised its net sales and earnings outlook for the year on November 4th, when it reported third-quarter results that exceeded its expectations.
“Our products remain an affordable treat for families and for consumers,” said Hershey CEO Michele Buck during an analyst call. “We know that part of that is they want to reward themselves when times are tough. They also use these products to relieve stress. And we think that those trends will continue.”
Customers are making some changes, she noted, like shopping at value channels or choosing value packs.
It’s not s’mores without Hershey
Companies like Mondelez and Hershey are largely spared competition from store brands, or private label, which are gaining ground as grocery prices rise.
According to IRI, just 2.7% of the US chocolate retail market is made up of private label, while that portion is much higher in other categories. In dairy milk, for example, store brands account for about 62% of sales. Even in salty snacks and non-chocolate candy, private label share is at 4.8%.
Shoppers are “brand specific” when it comes to chocolate, Sadler said. “You’re gonna make s’mores with a Hershey bar, you’re not going to substitute with something else.”
Mondelez benefits from that kind of brand loyalty, as well. “Shoppers continue to say they are much less likely to switch to private label in chocolate and biscuits compared to other categories,” said Mondelez’s Van de Put during the call.
Eventually, higher prices may hit the chocolate category. IRI is seeing volume sales start to dip, Sadler noted, suggesting that consumers are becoming more price sensitive.
And though private label sales pale in comparison to national brands, they are also growing at a faster clip than branded chocolate.
IRI’s data shows that private label sales rose 16% in the year through October 30 compared to the year before, while national brands grew by 8.8%.
Still, chocolate isn’t going anywhere. The sweet’s “position as an accessible indulgence will help shield it from significant impacts,” Mintel’s report said.

Biden describes what he discussed with Xi Jinping in G20 meeting03:43
November 14, 2022 Biden, Xi meet during G20 summit
By Simone McCarthy and Nectar Gan, CNN
Updated 1:39 AM ET, Tue November 15, 2022
What we covered
US President Joe Biden met Chinese leader Xi Jinping face-to-face on Monday for their first in-person encounter since Biden took office. The discussions could have long-lasting consequences for the world’s most important bilateral relationship.
The talks took place on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Bali, Indonesia, where world leaders are gathering to address pressing global issues from climate change to inflation and rising food prices, as the fallout from Russia's war in Ukraine looms.
For Biden and Xi, the talks offered a rare opportunity to improve communication and discuss what Biden has called the ""red lines"" for each side, amid rising US-China tensions and an increasingly militarized standoff over Taiwan.

Our live coverage of US President Joe Biden and Chinese leader Xi Jinping's meeting on the sidelines of the G20 has ended.
Read our full report here.
10:23 a.m. ET, November 14, 2022
The big take-away from the summit? The communication lines are back open
Expectations for major changes to the rocky US-China relationship were low heading into Monday evening's meeting between US President Joe Biden and Chinese leader Xi Jinping. And the summaries of the meetings released by the two sides afterwards revealed on-going divisions over key issues like Taiwan, human rights, technology and trade.
But the roughly three-hour face-to-face between the leaders did appear to a deliver on a key opportunity both sides appeared keen for: bolstering their communication.
Dialogue between Beijing and Washington had hit a new low in August, when Beijing cancelled dialogue across a number of areas in retaliation for US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan. Both sides have expressed fears of the potential consequences of a misunderstanding.
In their respective statements following Monday's meeting on the sidelines of the G20, both Washington and Beijing signaled that they would move forward on working together on a range of issues including climate change, health and food security --- and they pledged to keep communication lines open.
""The two presidents agreed that their respective diplomatic teams should maintain strategic communication and conduct regular consultations; their financial teams will continue dialogue and coordination on macroeconomic policies, economic ties and trade ...They agreed to make good use of the China-US joint working group to promote the resolution of more issues,"" a readout from China's Foreign Ministry said.
The White House said the two leaders agreed to ""empower key senior officials to maintain communication and deepen constructive efforts"" on issues such as climate change, global macroeconomic stability including debt relief, health security, and global food security. It also said the leaders supported efforts to address specific issues in the US-China relationships through working groups and other mechanisms.
""(Biden) reiterated that (US-China) competition should not veer into conflict and underscored that the United States and China must manage the competition responsibly and maintain open lines of communication,"" the statement said, adding that the leaders asked their teams to carry this work forward.
Secretary of State Blinken will visit China to follow up on their discussions, the White House said.
In a press conference following the meeting, Biden suggested that the open communication started with the leaders themselves this time around: ""I want to be clear, and be clear with all leaders, but particularly with Xi Jinping that I mean what I say and I say what I mean. So there's no misunderstanding -- that's the biggest concern.""
""And I must say (Xi) was as straightforward as he has been with me in the past. And I think that we understand one another, which is the most important thing that can be done.""

Biden says 'there need not be a new Cold War' with China
From CNN's Maegan Vazquez
Addressing the press following his meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping Monday, US President Joe Biden said ""there need not be a new Cold War"" with China, arguing conflict in competition between the two world powers can be avoided.
Biden told reporters that the two leaders ""were candid and clear with one another across the board."" Adding, ""I absolutely believe there need not be a new Cold War.""
The American President also said he does not think there is ""any imminent attempt on the part of China to invade Taiwan.""
Since taking office, Biden has repeatedly stated the US had an obligation to protect Taiwan should China attempt to invade. But at Monday's press conference, Biden told reporters he ""made it clear"" to Xi ""that our policy in Taiwan has not changed at all. It's the same exact position we've had.""
""I made it clear that we want to see cross-strait issues peacefully resolved. And, and so it never has to come to that,"" Biden said in reference to possible escalations. ""And I'm convinced that he understood exactly what I was saying. I understood what he was saying.""
Biden said both parties will continue to communicate through staff and Cabinet levels on issues discussed during their meeting.
""Look, I think the United States is better prepared than any country in the world economically and politically, to deal with the changing circumstances around the world,"" he added.
10:22 a.m. ET, November 14, 2022
Key takeaways from China's readout of Xi and Biden's meeting
Chinese leader Xi Jinping spoke with US President Joe Biden for more than three hours in their first in-person meeting as top leaders.
China’s Foreign Ministry has released a 1,600-word readout of what it says was discussed during their talks, and here are the main takeaways:
China-US relations: In an apparent attempt to address US concerns about China’s ambitions, Xi told Biden “China does not seek to change the existing international order or interfere in the internal affairs of the United States, and has no intention to challenge or displace the United States.” He noted that China-US relations should not be a zero-sum game because the world is big enough for the two countries to coexist and ""prosper together.""
Taiwan: Xi stressed “the Taiwan question is at the very core of China’s core interests, the bedrock of the political foundation of China-US relations, and the first red line that must not be crossed in China-US relations.” He urged the US to match its words with actions and abide by its one-China policy. The US' one-China policy acknowledges Beijing’s position that Taiwan is part of China, but does not accept its claim of sovereignty over the self-governing island.
Defending China’s system of governance: Xi pushed back at Biden framing the US' rivalry with China as “democracy versus authoritarianism,” claiming China has what he termed “Chinese-style democracy.” He said neither the US or China “should try to remould the other in one’s own image, or seek to change or even subvert the other’s system.”
Economic decoupling: Xi criticized the US for attempting to build ""walls and barriers,"" and push for ""decoupling and severing supply chains."" “We oppose politicizing and weaponizing economic and trade ties as well as exchanges in science and technology,” he said.
Ukraine: Xi said China is “highly concerned” about the current situation in Ukraine and ""has all along stood on the side of peace and will continue to encourage peace talks. But the readout made no direct mention of what the White House readout said was Xi and Biden’s joint opposition to the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons in Ukraine.
Communication: According to the readout, the two leaders instructed their teams to promptly follow up and implement the common understandings reached between them. They also agreed to maintain regular contact.

Xi launches this week of diplomacy more powerful than ever before

Xi Jinping’s handshake with US President Joe Biden has sent a clear message: the Chinese leader is now firmly back on the world stage.
Xi took no overseas trips since the start of the pandemic as China heavily restricted its borders and ramped up a stringent zero-Covid policy. Instead, the leader of the world's second largest economy conducted ""cloud diplomacy"" beaming into events via video-link and hosting summits online, even as his counterparts returned to business as usual.
But now, as Xi emerges back onto the world stage with his participation at the G20 and APEC summits in Bali and Bangkok this week, he is doing so having concentrated more power than ever before at home -- consolidated his status as the strongest Chinese leader since Chairman Mao Zedong.
Three weeks before Xi traveled to Bali, Indonesia to meet with Biden on the sidelines of the G20 summit, he was anointed a norm-shattering third term in office at the Communist Party’s National Congress.
The key political meeting also saw Xi retiring key party leaders seen as not in his inner circle and stacking the party’s top ranks with his staunch allies, some of whom were sitting at the table alongside Xi during his meeting with Biden on Monday evening.
While Xi took one international trip prior to that major leadership reshuffle, it was for a regional meeting of that saw Russia, China, India and Central Asian leaders gather in Uzbekistan one month prior to the leadership reshuffle at home.
Now, as he has consolidated power at home, it's clear that Xi is prepared to more squarely focus his attention on the international stage to address perceived threats to China there -- with the meeting with Biden being a key milestone in that new chapter of Xi's third term.

Biden says he's not certain how much influence Beijing has on North Korea's provocations
From CNN's Kevin Liptak in Bali, Indonesia
US President Joe Biden says he isn’t certain whether China has the ability to influence North Korea’s decision-making when it comes to nuclear or missile tests.
But he said he believes Chinese leader Xi Jinping does not want further escalatory action by Pyongyang, and sought to underscore what further provocations from the North might mean for the US presence in the region.
“I made it clear to President Xi Jinping that I thought they had an obligation to attempt to make it clear to North Korea that they should not engage in long range nuclear tests and I made it clear as well that if they did, they meaning North Korea, that we would have to take certain actions that would be more defensive on our behalf and it would not be directed against…China,” Biden said at a news conference in Bali after meeting with Xi for several hours.
“It's difficult to determine whether or not China has the capacity” to convince Kim Jong Un to back off his tests, Biden said. “I'm confident China is not looking for North Korea to engage in further escalatory means.”

US President Joe Biden says he did not interpret any ""imminent attempt"" by China to invade self-governing Taiwan after meeting for more than three hours with Chinese leader Xi Jinping.
Biden said in their talks, he made clear the US policy toward Taiwan had not changed, despite saying four times ahead of the talks the US would defend Taiwan militarily if China were to move on the self-governing island.
""I made it clear that we want to see cross-strait issues peacefully resolved, so it never has to come to that,"" Biden said of any potenital conflict over Taiwan.
""I'm convinced that that he understood exactly what I was saying,"" Biden said of the conversation on Taiwan.
9:22 a.m. ET, November 14, 2022
Biden says he will manage China and Xi's competition ""responsibly""
From CNN's Betsy Klein
US President Joe Biden said he plans to manage China and its leader Xi Jinping’s competition “responsibly” as he recapped their three-hour meeting Monday evening in Bali, detailing topics of an “open and candid” discussion. 
“We had an open and candid conversation about our intentions and our priorities. It was clear – he was clear and I was clear that we’ll defend American interests and values, promote universal human rights, and stand up to the international order and work in lockstep with our allies and partners,” Biden told reporters.
He continued, “We’re going to compete vigorously, but I’m not looking for conflict. I’m going to manage his competition responsibly.”
Biden said he told Xi that the US One China policy “has not changed” and the US “(opposes) unilateral change in the status quo by either side.”
He said the US and China “should be able to work together where we can to solve global challenges that require every nation to do its part.” 
Other topics included Russia’s aggression against Ukraine and a shared “belief in the threat for the use of nuclear weapons is totally unacceptable.”
Biden reiterated that Secretary of State Antony Blinken will travel to China for follow-up meetings.

Biden touts the strength of US democracy in the midterm elections after Xi meeting
From CNN's Maegan Vazquez

US President Joe Biden began his press conference in Bali by speaking about the ""strength and resilience"" of American democracy following the recent midterm elections.
During the campaign season, the President sought to cast the election as a referendum on election denialism and political violence, warning the future of American democracy was in danger and on the ballot in November.
Since Biden's departure from Washington for his multi-leg international trip, results from Arizona and Nevada have shown that Democrats are poised to keep a majority in the US Senate.
""What we saw was the strength and resilience in American democracy. We saw it in action. The American people prove once again that democracy is who we are,"" Biden said from the podium on Monday after his meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping.
Biden said the elections showed ""a strong rejection of election deniers at every level from those seeking to lead our states and noses to get to serve in Congress and also those seeking to oversee the elections. And there was a strong rejection of political violence and voter intimidation.""

 — 
Police have in custody a University of Virginia student and ex-UVA football player suspected of fatally shooting three current players and wounding two other people late Sunday at the school’s main campus in Charlottesville as a bus returned from a class field trip, school officials said.
The suspect, Christopher Darnell Jones Jr., faces three charges of second-degree murder and three counts of using a handgun in the commission of a felony, UVA Police Chief Timothy Longo Sr. told reporters Monday morning as an hourslong manhunt came to an end and authorities lifted a campus lockdown order.

Jones was arrested without incident around 11 a.m. ET about 80 miles east of Charlottesville in Henrico County, the county police agency said in a statement. An officer spotted the vehicle Jones was driving in the eastern area of Henrico where he was “taken into custody without incident,” according to news release from the police division.
Police have not offered a motive for the attack.

Those killed were Devin Chandler, Lavel Davis Jr. and D’Sean Perry, university President Jim Ryan said. The two wounded students are being treated at UVA Medical Center, with one in critical condition and the other in good condition, he said, declining to name them.
One of the two injured students was identified as Michael Hollins, according to Andrew Martin, the head football coach at the University Lab School in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Hollins is a junior at UVA and is a running back for school’s football team, according to the team’s roster. CNN has reached out to Hollins’ family but has not received a response.
Hollins’ father, Michael Hollins Sr., told The Washington Post his son was shot in the back with the bullet lodged in his stomach. Hollins Sr. told the Post he’s expected to recover.
Left to right: Devin Chandler, D'Sean Perry and Lavel Davis Jr.
“This is a sad, shocking and tragic day for our UVA community,” Ryan said. “Let me say how deeply sorry I am for the victims and for their family and friends.”
Carla Williams, UVA athletics director, said in a statement that as a mother herself, she aches for the parents and family members of the victims.
“We lost three talented and bright young men,” Williams said. “We will never see what their impact on the world would have been, but we will never forget their impact on us. I miss Lavel, D’Sean and Devin. I pray for peace, comfort and hope for their parents and loved ones.”
Tony Elliot, UVA head football coach, said in a statement that it’s hard for him to find the words to “express the devastation and heartache that our team is feeling today.”
“These were incredible young men with huge aspirations and extremely bright futures. Our hearts ache for their families, their classmates and their friends. These precious young men were called away too soon,” Elliot said. “We are all fortunate to have them be a part of our lives. They touched us, inspired us and worked incredibly hard as representatives of our program, university and community.”
Deadliest Mass Shootings in the US Fast Facts
At least 68 shootings have unfolded this year on US school grounds, including 15 on college campuses, CNN finds, with at least one person shot in each case, not including the shooter. The deadliest school shooting in modern US history remains the 2007 attack at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg, where a 23-year-old student killed 32 people before dying by suicide.
The shooting at the Charlottesville campus is also one of nearly 600 mass shootings in the US this year, according to the Gun Violence Archive, which like CNN tallies cases in which at least four people are shot, excluding the shooter.
Shooting prompted immediate lockdowns
The attack happened Sunday on a bus returning from a class trip to Washington, DC, where the class had seen a play, university officials said. It was not immediately clear if Jones was part of that class or attended the field trip.
Police responded to a report of shots fired around 10:30 p.m. in an area near a parking garage on Culbreth Road and surrounded by academic buildings, Ryan said. Two slain victims were inside the bus, with the third victim taken to a hospital, where he died, Longo said.

The call prompted a shelter-in-place alert that was lifted about 12 hours later, Longo said. More than 500 people sheltered throughout campus buildings, including in libraries and classrooms, he said.
Monday classes at the university were canceled. The school canceled classes Tuesday to “to give “students the opportunity to reflect, mourn and gather with each other,” according to a news release. A family and community assistance center has also been set up on campus to provide UVA community members with mental health services, according to UVA Emergency Management officials.
Classes were also canceled Monday at Charlottesville City Schools, the K-12 district said in a letter to families. A UVA men’s basketball game scheduled for Monday evening has also been canceled, the university said.
In a statement, an attorney for Perry’s parents thanked the communities in both Charlottesville and South Florida – Perry was originally from Miami, the university said – for “the outpouring of support during this impossibly tragic time.
Happy and Sean Perry would not speak publicly at this time about their son’s death, attorney Michael Haggard said, out of respect for the university community, which “has been terrorized by another mass shooting in the United States.”
Suspect had been known to campus police
Jones had come to campus authorities’ attention in September, when authorities found out Jones “had made a comment about possessing a gun” to someone “unaffiliated with the university,” Longo said at Monday’s news conference. But that person never actually saw the gun in question, he said.
Christopher Darnell Jones Jr.
“Through the course of the threat assessment team’s investigation, we learned of a prior criminal incident involving a concealed weapon violation that occurred outside the city of Charlotteville in February of 2021,” Longo said, adding the suspect was required to report that incident to the university but never did. The school’s judicial council took over the case, and the results are pending.
Jones was also involved in a hazing investigation on campus that was closed because witnesses would not cooperate, Longo said.
What we know about the suspect in the deadly University of Virginia shooting
It is “important to share that information with you,” he said, “to let you know that he had been called to our attention.”
Jones is listed on UVA’s athletics website as a football player in 2018 who as a freshman did not participate in any games. He attended Varina High School and Petersburg High School, where he played football as a linebacker and running back, according to his university athletics bio. While in high school, Jones was Key Club president and a member of the National Honor Society and the National Technical Honor Society, the bio says.
A UVA spokesperson told CNN Jones had a pre-existing injury that prevented him from playing on the football team in 2018. Jones went through medical treatment and rehabilitation during his time with the team and was only a member of the team for one season, the spokesperson says.
The spokesperson would not give details on Jones’ injury.
Federal prosecutors working with local authorities
Before the lockdown was lifted, UVA students early Monday were told to “take the shelter in place commands seriously as the situation remains active,” vice president and chief student affairs officer Robyn Hadley said in an email to UVA’s student body.
“We have all received several shelter in place texts, and they are frightening,” Hadley said, adding several police jurisdictions were working to find the suspect. “I am on grounds like many of you; I am sheltering in place and in direct touch with University leadership and UPD … If you are not inside and safe, immediately seek safety.”
Two UVA students who told CNN they were at the scene of the shooting Sunday night and saw part of it unfold described hearing faint popping noises and watching people flee the bus.
The students – both of whom are 21 and did not want to be identified – said they were walking to the gym when they saw the charter bus, still in motion. It was just after 10 p.m. when they heard the popping noises, the students said, but they didn’t think anything of it. The bus was going over a speed bump, they said, but then they saw it stop and saw emergency lights turn on.
4 University of Idaho students found dead in home outside campus in what police are calling a homicide
The bus doors opened, the students said, and they saw people running out. The students told CNN they saw one fall to the ground.
The students hid behind a brick wall in front of the nearby band building before calling 911 around 10:17 p.m., they said. The call wasn’t answered, the students said, but they hung up when they heard sirens in the distance and saw law enforcement arrive.
State and federal prosecutors are helping local agencies in the investigation, according to a joint statement from the US attorney for the Western District of Virginia and commonwealth’s attorneys for Charlottesville and for Albemarle County. The officials pledged to support the investigation and “bring possible charges in the appropriate jurisdiction,” the statement said.
Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin on Monday called the shooting a “horrific tragedy” and praised the work of law enforcement for taking the suspect into custody, according to a tweet. “While there are still many details to uncover, let us lift up the entire community in prayer.” The governor earlier had said Virginia State Police were “fully coordinating” with school and local police.
Vice President Kamala Harris spoke on the shooting shortly after swearing in a new ambassador to Trinidad and Tobago on Monday.
“It’s tragic,” Harris said. “Of course, our prayers are with the families of the victims and it’s just yet a constant reminder that we have to do better in terms of gun safety laws in our country.”
Meantime, another US campus – the University of Idaho – is reeling after police announced a homicide inquiry after officers Sunday discovered four people deceased in a home just outside Moscow campus grounds. The deceased were students, and the cause of their deaths is not yet known, the university confirmed, adding the threat has ended.
Separately, Charlottesville Police arrested a man in connection to “threatening social media posts” against UVA on Monday, but said they don’t believe the threats were tied to the earlier shooting.
“We understand the fear this caused in our community and acted swiftly to resolve this investigation,” a Charlottesville police news release said.
Sunday’s shooting is the University of Virginia’s latest high-profile run-in with violence: White nationalists in August 2017 marched across campus carrying torches and chanting racist slogans. A day later, demonstrators protesting Charlottesville’s plan to remove a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee clashed with counterprotesters, one of whom was killed when a man drove his car into a crowd; that driver is serving life in prison.
A UVA lacrosse player five years earlier was convicted and sentenced to 23 years in prison for the 2010 killing of his ex-girlfriend, Yeardley Love, in her off-campus apartment.

Mindfulness works just as well as medication to curb anxiety, study finds
By Zoe Sottile, CNN
Published 6:01 AM EST, Sun November 13, 2022
Meditation could be prescribed in lieu of medication for patients who experience severe side effects to anti-anxiety medications, according to the study's lead author.

CNN
 — 
A mindfulness meditation course may be as effective at reducing anxiety as a common medication, according to a new study.
The research, published on November 9 in JAMA Psychiatry, involved a group of 276 adults with untreated anxiety disorders. Half of the patients were randomly selected to take 10 to 20 mg of escitalopram, the generic form of Lexapro, a common medication used to treat anxiety and depression. The other half were assigned to an eight-week course in mindfulness-based stress reduction.
The results were stunning: Both groups experienced about a 20% reduction in their anxiety symptoms over the eight-week period.
Eating disorders have risen in recent years. A new finding may help catch them earlier
Elizabeth Hoge, the lead author on the study and the director of the Anxiety Disorders Research Program at Georgetown University Medical Center, told CNN that she hopes the research can open up more treatment options for patients with anxiety.
“Lexapro is a great drug; I prescribe it a lot,” she said. “But it’s not for everyone.”
Meditation could be prescribed in lieu of medication for patients who experience severe side effects or have allergies to anti-anxiety medications, for instance, Hoge says. And starting meditation could also be a first step for people who have untreated anxiety and are wary of medication.
But the research shouldn’t be a trigger for patients to stop taking their medication without consulting a doctor. “If someone’s already taking a medication, they can try meditation at the same time,” Hoge said. “If they wanna come off the medication, they should talk to their doctor.”
There may be undetermined factors that make some patients respond better to meditation. Hoge says that after data collection had ended, participants were given the option to try the treatment option that they hadn’t been assigned. Some patients who had been assigned to the meditation group found that the medication was actually much more effective for them, and vice versa, according to Hoge.
Hoge says that further research could explore “what are the predictors of response in the different treatments,” studying which patients benefit more from meditation versus medication. Then clinicians could prescribe different treatment regimens based on their patient profiles.
How meditation could change the brain
And she hopes that the research leads to more insurance companies covering meditation courses as anxiety treatment.
“Usually, insurance companies are willing to pay for something when there’s research supporting its use,” she said. “If they know it’s just as effective as the drug which they do pay for, why don’t they pay for this too?”
The patients assigned to the meditation group were asked to attend a mindfulness meditation group class in-person once a week. Each class was around two-and-a-half hours long and held at a local clinic. They were also asked to meditate on their own for around 40 minutes per day.
Hoge compared the time commitment to “taking an exercise class or an art class.”
But according to Joseph Arpaia, an Oregon-based psychiatrist specializing in mindfulness and meditation, the daily time commitment is likely too much for many patients dealing with anxiety.
“Telling people who are that overworked they should spend 45 minutes a day meditating is the ‘Let them eat cake’ of psychotherapy,” he wrote in a response to Hoge’s publication, also published in JAMA Psychiatry.
Arpaia says that he has worked to find less time-intensive mindfulness methods to help patients manage their anxiety. One technique he teaches is called a “one-breath reset” that helps patients calm themselves over the course of a single breath.
But despite his reservations, “It’s always interesting to see meditation work, and it works as well as medication,” he said. “My hope would be that people realize that there are things other than medication that can work.”
“My other hope would be they realize that if sitting and following your breath makes you feel relaxed, great, but it doesn’t make everyone feel relaxed. Find something that does. Read a book, go for a walk, spend time gardening,” he said.
How mindfulness works
The patients assigned to the meditation group participated in a specific program called mindfulness-based stress reduction, first developed by Jon Kabat-Zinn in the 1970s. The program is secular but based on some Buddhist teachings.
“It’s like a skill you practice,” Hoge said. “People learn to have a different relationship with their thoughts. In the practice, we train people to just let go of the thoughts, be patient and gentle with the thoughts, just let them pass.”
How a 'micro-practice' can ease stress and help you sleep
The “practice of doing that over and over lets people put a little distance between themselves and their thoughts,” she said.
Patients shouldn’t expect meditation – or medication – to completely eliminate their anxiety, according to Hoge. “It’s normal to have anxiety,” she said. “But we can make it quiet down a little bit.”
“People think meditation is hard, that you have to keep your mind clear of thoughts,” she said. “That is not the case. You’re still meditating even if you’re having thoughts. Just having the intention to meditate counts.”
And Arpaia says that meditation can help disrupt the feedback loops that foster anxiety.
“Anxiety tends to be something that feeds on itself,” he said. “What happens is a person becomes anxious, which impairs their cognitive and social skills. As the person starts to feel more impaired, that builds anxiety.”
Anxiety isn’t the only challenge that meditation might help patients address.
A study published in the American Journal of Nursing in 2011 found that an eight-week mindfulness program was just as effective as antidepressants for preventing a relapse of depression.
Hoge said that different meditation programs might be appropriate for helping treat depression and ADHD, among other conditions.
“I think there’s great promise there,” she said.

TSA to conduct additional training after passenger is allowed on a flight with two boxcutters, agency says
By Hannah Sarisohn, Emma Tucker and Pete Muntean, CNN
Updated 10:15 AM EST, Tue November 15, 2022
The TSA said it would provide a shift brief on this incident for all screening employees nationwide, which will include reminders on the protocol for using technology tools and handling prohibited items.

 — 
The Transportation Security Administration is admitting multiple failures and is instituting alerts to security officers at airports nationwide after a man got through a checkpoint with two box cutters. The move comes as passengers are expected to flood airports ahead of Thanksgiving.
TSA security checkpoint agents at Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport failed to adhere to protocol Friday evening when they discovered a box cutter in a man’s carry-on luggage, later causing an emergency diversion when the man allegedly threatened passengers when the plane was in-flight, according to a TSA statement and a passenger on the flight.
The TSA said in a statement released Sunday that it reviewed Friday’s incident and found the agents did not fully use the technology at their disposal which would have identified the box cutters inside the passenger’s carry-on luggage, nor did they follow protocol when they returned some of the items back to the passenger after an inspection. After initially suggesting the blades were returned, the TSA later clarified that they were removed and “the box cutter without the visible blades was handed back to the passenger.”
The male passenger, who has not yet been identified, approached the TSA checkpoint around 5:30 p.m. on Friday at Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport (CVG) with a ticket for a Frontier Airlines flight to Tampa International Airport (TPA), the TSA said. He showed his identification, including a temporary Ohio drivers’ license, and underwent physical screening, the agency said.
The traveler then presented two backpacks and put his loose items into a bin for additional screening, the TSA said, which were screened using CT technology that “creates a 3-D image that can be rotated 360 degrees for a thorough analysis.”
The Frontier Airlines Flight 1761 was diverted to Atlanta after the man was seen with a box cutter and allegedly threatened passengers mid-flight.
“The aircraft landed safely in Atlanta and the passenger in question was taken into custody by Atlanta law enforcement,” spokesperson Jennifer De La Cruz told CNN in a statement.
A passenger with box cutters prompted a Frontier Airlines flight to make an emergency landing in Atlanta, airline says
There were no injuries to passengers or crew members, according to the airline.
All passengers left the plane and were provided overnight hotel accommodations in Atlanta. A new flight was scheduled for Saturday morning to take them to Tampa.
A subsequent review of the incident, which included closed-circuit television (CCTV) footage, found the “image review capabilities of the CT were not fully used” and the box cutters were not identified by the CT operator, the TSA said. However, the traveler’s property was brought for a further search, during which one box cutter was discovered.
The “visible blades” were removed, but they were then returned back to the passenger, the agency said. The man’s backpack containing the second box cutter and the remainder of his property was screened for explosives, but the second box cutter was not detected at that time, the statement continued.
A government source familiar with the investigation tells CNN that the passenger in question was not a known threat to the TSA and that the incident has been elevated to the highest levels of the agency.
The TSA employees who were involved in the incident have been placed in a training status for “remediation on CT image review and physical search procedures,” the agency said, adding that it will conduct shift briefings on the incident for all of its CVG and State of Kentucky employees.
The briefings will include reminders on procedures to properly handle box cutters as well as other prohibited items discovered during a search, the TSA said.
Statewide refresher training will be scheduled for CT image review with an “emphasis on use of the image rotation and manipulation tools for optimal detection,” according to the statement.
The agency said it would provide a shift brief on this incident for all screening employees nationwide, which will include reminders on the protocol for using technology tools and handling prohibited items.
The US Attorney’s Office has taken the lead on investigating the situation, according to the TSA.
“TSA has started an internal review of the incident by viewing CCTV, airport security checkpoint processes/operations and will continue to provide updates as they are available. TSA can confirm that blades are prohibited in the cabin, but allowed in checked luggage,” according to the statement on Saturday.

Rockefeller Center Christmas tree arrives in New York City after road trip from Maryland
By David Williams, CNN

 — 
This year’s Rockefeller Center Christmas tree got a well-earned police escort into New York City Saturday morning to cap off a lengthy road trip from Maryland.
The 79-foot-tall Norway Spruce arrived Saturday morning on a flatbed semi-trailer and the NYPD Highway Unit helped it negotiate the city streets from the highway to its final destination.
The tree, which is 46 feet wide and weighs 12 tons, was cut down on Thursday in Elkton, Maryland, for its trip to New York, according to the Rockefeller Center Facebook page. It’s the first time the tree has come from Maryland, Rockefeller Center posted.
The two-day trip was a challenge.
National forests will let you cut your own Christmas tree
“We need New Jersey permits to bring it up on the turnpike, it stays overnight by the Meadowlands. We need Maryland and Delaware permits for it to travel because it’s an oversized load. It has to have special permits, special escorts – police escort, obviously – for security reasons and just to get it here safe,” New York Truck Escorts and Permits President Maureen Mandich told CNN affiliate WABC.
Workers could be seen using a large crane to lift the tree into place on Saturday morning.
Where to go for the holidays: Experts weigh in on destinations and risks
It will be strung with 50,000 multi-colored LED lights on more than 5 miles of wire and then topped with a Swarovski star that weighs about 900 pounds and is covered with 3 million crystals, the Rockefeller Center website said.
The traditional tree lighting ceremony is scheduled for December 1.

Disneyland adds dolls in wheelchairs to 'It's a Small World' ride
Natasha Chen, CNN • Updated 11th November 2022
Facebook
Twitter
Email
Anaheim, California (CNN) — For the first time in Disneyland's 67-year history, there are now characters in wheelchairs represented on an attraction.
On Friday morning, two dolls in wheelchairs were unveiled on the theme park's ""It's a Small World"" ride, a project that took more than half a year and involved both Disney creatives and the park's accessibility team.
The change was part of an ongoing effort of looking at the resort ""with a magnifying glass"" for opportunities for inclusion, said Kim Irvine, executive creative director of Walt Disney Imagineering for Disneyland Resort.
Jill Houghton, president and CEO of Disability:IN, a nonprofit that works on business disability inclusion, called the new dolls ""a fantastic addition.""
""The dolls are participating inclusively alongside their non-disabled peers, which is something we want to see more of, instead of being depicted as limited or incapable because of a disability,"" Houghton said in a statement to CNN.
She noted that the Americans with Disabilities Act was passed in 1990, ""but nothing in this law compels businesses to increase representation.
""Disney clearly sees the benefits of attracting a wider audience that is inclusive to everyone. We need to see more of this in pop culture, theme parks and entertainment if we want to be truly representative of the largest minority group in the world,"" Houghton said.
The ""It's a Small World"" attraction, designed by Disney artist Mary Blair, opened in 1966 in Anaheim, California, after it was presented at the 1964-65 World's Fair in New York.
The same ride was added to other Disney parks around the world, where guests board a boat and sail through multiple countries, featuring more than 300 Audio-Animatronics figures representing children from around the world.
Irvine said the new additions fit into the spirit of the original attraction.
""What a wonderful story that Walt and Mary Blair, and the original Imagineers, put together about the children of the world and our unity all under one bright sun -- and how we really should rejoice together in that.""
The dolls that are now in wheelchairs were originally standing. Irvine said the same characters with the same clothing were recreated in a seated position, in wheelchairs designed to match the Mary Blair style.
One doll is located in the ride's South America scene, and the other appears in the final scene where dolls from many countries sing together.
Adding 'meaningful things'
The attraction at Disneyland reopened on Friday after a brief closure for the addition of these dolls and the installation of holiday décor for the ""It's a Small World Holiday"" edition of the ride that will run through early January.
While the holiday décor is seasonal, the dolls in wheelchairs are a permanent addition.
Dolls with wheelchairs are also expected to be added to ""It's a Small World"" in Walt Disney World and Disneyland Paris sometime next year.
But because each resort's version of the ride has a different layout and different sets, those new dolls and wheelchairs will be designed with the specific version of the ride in mind.
""I think that is definitely something that the original Imagineers would embrace and think was wonderful that we were looking at things like this,"" Irvine said.
""We are always looking to enhance our attractions with not just fun things, but meaningful things as well. And keeping timely with what's happening in the world, and especially, you know, making things new.
""I know we never want our attractions to become so predictable that you could ride them with your eyes closed and know what's going on in there. We like to constantly be surprising you with new things and important things, especially relevant things.""
The new dolls were the result of a more than six-month collaboration.
Disneyland Resort/Christian Thom
Erin Quintanilla, manager of accessibility for the Disneyland Resort, said this was a historic moment.
""I feel seen. I feel represented. It's a monumental moment to have my community be in an attraction and represented,"" said Quintanilla, who uses a wheelchair. ""I teared up when I saw them in the attraction.""
Quintanilla said her team had been approached by Disneyland creatives who wanted to add these dolls. Her accessibility team made sure the look was authentic, down to the angle of the dolls' feet on the wheelchair footplates.
""We wanted to make sure that it was a person in a wheelchair who was independently moving through life. So we didn't want the wheelchair to feel like a hospital style wheelchair. You'll notice in the design, it's beautifully created to align with a Mary Blair style,"" said Quintanilla.
""But there are details of the wheelchair like having a push rim so that the doll would be able to move through the story in a way that I move through the world. So it's pretty special to have those details be accurate,"" Quintanilla said.
Other changes from Disney
New dolls have not been added to the Disneyland version of this ride since 2009.
At that time, a ""Spirit of America"" room was added, including three Native American dolls and characters from the movie ""Toy Story.""
More dolls of specific Disney characters were added throughout the attraction.
As part of overall efforts to improve inclusion and diversity in its theme parks, Disney recently announced changing the Splash Mountain attraction, which is based on characters from ""Song of the South,"" into a theme inspired by ""The Princess and the Frog,"" featuring Disney's first Black princess.

The health benefits of a random act of kindness

15 random ways to be kind

Editor’s Note: Sign up for CNN’s Stress, But Less newsletter. Our six-part mindfulness guide will inform and inspire you to reduce stress while learning how to harness it.
CNN
 — 
Spreading kindness not only helps others feel better about themselves — it can also boost the giver’s health and happiness, according to research. It’s a win-win for all.
Putting the well-being of others before our own without expecting anything in return — or what is called being altruistic — stimulates the reward centers of the brain, studies have shown. Those feel-good chemicals flood our system, producing a sort of “helper’s high.” Volunteering, for example, has been shown to minimize stress and improve depression.
Longer life, anyone?
Being happier will help you live longer, so learn how to be happier
That’s not all: The same activity can also reduce the risk for cognitive impairment and even help us live longer. One reason for this, experts say, is because kindness contributes to our sense of community and belonging. And that, studies have found, is a key contributor to a healthy, longer life.
Lower blood pressure
Giving donations to others, or “prosocial spending,” has been shown to reduce blood pressure and improve heart health. One study asked a group of hypertensive people to spend $40 on themselves, while another group of people with high blood pressure were told to spend the money on others.
Why being an optimist is good for your heart
They found that those who spent money on others had lower blood pressure at the end of the six-week study. In fact, the benefits were as large as those from healthy diet and exercise.
Pain reduction
Giving seems to lessen our pain. A recent study found that people who said they would donate money to help orphans were less sensitive to an electric shock than those who declined to give. In addition, the more helpful people thought their donation would be, the less pain they felt.
How could this happen? The study found that regions of the brain that react to painful stimulation appear to be instantly deactivated by the experience of giving.
Happiness
In the UK, researchers found that being kind could boost happiness in as little as three days. The study assigned people to three groups: the first group had to do an act of kindness each day; the second group tried a new activity; and the third group did nothing. The groups who were kind and did novel things saw a significant boost in happiness.
Spreading kindness doesn't have to be complicated.
You’ll experience even greater joy if you’re creative with your acts of kindness. Happiness researchers Sonja Lyubomirsky and Kennon Sheldon found that people who did a variety of acts of kindness throughout the week showed greater increases in happiness than those who performed the same activity over and over again.
And here’s the good news: It seems acts of kindness can be anonymous or visible, spontaneous or planned, and can be as simple as giving a compliment or opening a door for someone.
Kindness suggestions
OK, you’re convinced and want to jump right into being a kinder and more helpful person. There are literally hundreds of ideas on the internet, but here are a few to get you started:
While driving, make room for the car that wants to enter your lane.
Give a genuine compliment to a family member, friend or colleague.
Do the same for your boss — they probably never get compliments!
Let go of a grudge and tell that person you forgive them (unless telling them makes it worse).
Be there for a friend having a tough time. Don’t try to fix it; just listen.
Leave your mail carrier a thank-you note.
Overtip your delivery person.
But I’m so tired
That’s more than fair. Many people are struggling economically and are often overcome with balancing the needs of family, work and community. Consider being kind to yourself (in whatever way that means to you) as well as others. We all need a break.
Want more ideas? The Random Acts of Kindness Foundation, which promotes kindness all year, has lists of kindness ideas, organized by work, community, environment, animals, strangers, kids, seniors and more.
“You’re making the world a better place,” the foundation says. But don’t forget — any kindness you give to others is also a gift to yourself.

How this school in the Indian desert stays cool even in extreme heat
Updated 7th November 2022
1 / 8 -New York architect Diana Kellogg designed the Rajkumari Ratnavati Girl's School, which is currently providing a comfortable and sustainable learning environment for 120 girls in Jaisalmer, India.Diana Kellogg Architects
Written by
Chelsea Lee, CNN
In the north Indian desert town of Jaisalmer, also known as ""The Golden City"" for its array of yellow sandstone architecture, temperatures can reach approximately 120 degrees Fahrenheit (49 degrees Celsius) at the height of summer.
Here, buildings have long been designed to adapt to the heat, a tradition that New York architect Diana Kellogg has followed with her work on the Rajkumari Ratnavati Girls' School.
The project, which is meant to empower women and girls through education in a region where the female literacy rate is the lowest in India, was commissioned by CITTA, a US non-profit organization that provides economic and education support to women in remote and marginalized communities. It's the first step in a three-part architectural project that will also include a women's cooperative center and an exhibition space.
Named the 2020 ""Building of the Year"" by Architectural Digest India, the eco-friendly sandstone school opened in November 2021 and 120 girls are currently enrolled in its curriculum, according to Kellogg.
Natural cooling
Designing a comfortable learning space can be challenging in the heart of the Thar desert, where climate change is making drought spells longer and more intense. Kellogg, who usually designs high-end residential projects, was motivated by a 2014 trip to Jaisalmer, and wanted the building to symbolize the hope and resilience of the desert by merging aspects of traditional Jaisalmer architecture with a modern design.
""There are methods to cool spaces that have been used for centuries. What I did is I put them together in a combination that worked,"" Kellogg said, adding that indoor temperatures at the school are approximately 20-30 degrees Fahrenheit lower than the outdoors.

For the structure, she opted to use locally sourced sandstone -- a climate-resilient material that's been long used for buildings in the area, including the Jaisalmer Fort, a part of the city that hosts one fourth of its population and is a UNESCO World Heritage site.
""It's so abundant in this area. It's very reasonable (in price) and the extremely talented stonemasons are just magicians with the stone,"" Kellogg said. ""It actually keeps the heat out and also keeps the coolness out at night.""
Among the traditional techniques Kellogg incorporated into the design is lining the inner walls with lime plaster, a porous and natural cooling material that helps release any trapped moisture resulting from humidity. Inspired by other buildings in the region, she also installed a jali wall — a sandstone grid that enables wind to accelerate in a phenomenon called the venturi effect, cooling the courtyard space while also providing shade from the sun. High ceilings and windows release rising heat in classrooms, while a solar panel canopy provides shade and energy.
The structure, which is angled in relation to the prevailing winds, has an elliptical shape, chosen for its ability to capture and circulate cool air, but also for its symbolic connotations of femininity, matching the ethos of the project. Kellogg calls it ""a big, tight hug.""

Comfort in sustainability
While many of the cooling techniques used at the school could be applied elsewhere in principle, their effectiveness and sustainability would vary from site to site, Kellogg admits. Particular wind directions and different sandstones would regulate temperatures differently to the materials found and used in Jaisalmer, for example.
Air conditioning isn't used anywhere in the building, not just because of its environmental impact but because it isn't common in the area. By adopting traditional and natural cooling mechanisms that the students are familiar with instead, she believes they can get sense of comfort from their surroundings, leading to greater confidence.
""I've seen it myself over the last three, four months,"" she said.
""The change in the girls, from being quite shy to being these bright lights that are devouring whatever kind of information you put in front of them.""

‘Miracle’ elephant twins born at Rosamond Gifford Zoo
By Zoe Sottile, CNN
Updated 8:14 PM EST, Mon November 14, 2022
Rare twin elephants were born at the Rosamond Gifford Zoo in Syracuse, New York.

 — 
The Rosamond Gifford Zoo in Syracuse, New York, has welcomed not one, but two new bundles of joy.
The Asian elephant twins were born on October 24 to parents Mali and Doc, according to a news release from the zoo.
The birth of twins was a shock for zoo staff, according to the release. Less than 1% of elephant births are twins – and when twins are born, they rarely survive.
The first baby was born at around 2 a.m., weighing in at 220 pounds, says the release.
Then, 10 hours later, Mali delivered a second male calf, much to the surprise of staff monitoring. The second newborn was 237 pounds but was “noticeably weaker than the first.”

So the “zoo’s animal care team and veterinary staff sprang into action and were able to significantly improve the calf’s condition,” says the release.
The team hadn’t predicted the birth of twins “due to the sheer improbability as well as the complexity of elephant ultrasounds,” according to the release. But they were still prepared with a specialized milk replacer on hand to supplement the second calf’s diet.
There has never been a recorded case of elephant twins surviving in the United States, says the zoo, making the birth a “historic moment” for the facility.
“This is truly a historic moment for the zoo and our community. I couldn’t be prouder of our exceptional animal care team, the support of the veterinary staff and their tremendous dedication to Mali and the twins,” said Onondaga County Executive Ryan J. McMahon in the release.
Zoo staff was shocked when mother Mali delivered a second calf 10 hours after delivering her first.

“The important research happening right here at the zoo will have a significant impact worldwide on behalf of this magnificent endangered species.”
The miracle twins are Asian elephants, an endangered species found throughout south and Southeast Asia, according to the World Wildlife Fund. The species’ population has declined largely due to habitat fragmentation, human-elephant conflict, and poaching.
As adults, the calves will likely weigh around 11,000 pounds and stand between 6 and 11 feet tall, per the World Wildlife Fund’s size estimates.
In addition to helping boost the population of the endangered species, the zoo also hopes that the twins’ birth will contribute to efforts to eliminate a fatal elephant disease, according to the release. Mali and Doc’s previous two calves died from elephant endotheliotropic herpes virus, a strain of herpes that is the leading cause of death among young elephants, says the release.
Mali’s placentas were sent to Baylor University for research in the hopes of developing a vaccine and treatment for the disease, says the zoo. And the twins will continue to be monitored and tested for the disease.
The birth of the twins brings the Rosamond Gifford Zoo’s herd to a total of eight elephants. Visitors can check out the miracle babies – alongside the rest of the herd – at the zoo’s Helga Beck Asian Elephant Preserve.

My son has been asking for a dress. I finally decided to just get him dresses despite being afraid he’d get teased by other kids. Today, the boy next door asked why he was wearing a dress, I said “he wanted one” and he said “okay” then they continued to play. The kids are alright

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez says she feels in danger in current political environment
By Paul LeBlanc, CNN
Published 6:00 AM EST, Fri November 11, 2022

Washington
CNN
 — 
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said that she “absolutely” has felt her life is in danger since joining Congress, with her head always “on a swivel” when she’s in public amid the nation’s charged political environment.
“It is a very real dynamic and very unfortunately and tragically we’ve seen political violence play out,” the New York Democrat told CNN’s Chris Wallace on “Who’s Talking to Chris Wallace?”
The New York Democrat said the deluge of threats against her means “when I wake up in the morning, I hesitate to walk my dog. It means when I come home, I have to ask my fiancé to come out to where my car is to walk me just from my car to my front door.”
“It means that there’s just – a general disposition where you kind of feel like there’s almost a static electricity around you,” she said.

More on the midterms
The recent attack on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s husband has touched off fresh concern about violence against lawmakers and their families. Federal law enforcement agencies have consistently warned about the increasing threat of politically motivated violence after January 6, 2021, raising specific concerns about the likelihood that online calls for violence result in real-world attacks.
Ocasio-Cortez’s progressive credentials have made her the ire of many congressional Republicans and their supporters. She told The New York Times this fall that her office struggles to keep up with “astronomical” amount of threats she receives each day.
Such an environment, Ocasio-Cortez told CNN, has influenced her approach to her work, pushing her to be “as robust and urgent as possible.”
“I don’t want to take the time I have for granted. I don’t know if I’m going to be there to see us achieve guaranteed health care in the United States. So I need to advocate it in a very fully throated way right now,” she said.
“Similar to a full path to citizenship for millions of people in this country. I just have to be out and say it and at least leave a roadmap should I not be there.”
Asked about the future of Democratic leadership in Congress, Ocasio-Cortez, speaking broadly, said, “I do believe we need to have not just generational shifts, but potentially substantive shifts as well.”
“I think that and I hope that what we’ve seen, whether people think it’s too left or too right, or up or down or whatever, it may be that we shift in a direction where the leadership of the Democratic Party is less reliant on large and corporate donors and sponsorship, because that does have a shaping effect of our legislative priorities,” she said.

National Native American Veterans Memorial formally dedicated at a ceremony in Washington, D.C

Hundreds of Native American veterans gathered in Washington D.C. on Friday for the dedication ceremony of the National Museum of the American Indian’s National Native Americans Veterans Memorial.

The dedication ceremony was part of a three-day event honoring Native American veterans, according to a news release from the Smithsonian. The ceremony started with a procession of over 1,500 Native veterans.
“The dedication of this memorial is an opportunity to gather and reflect on the extraordinary service and sacrifice of Native veterans and their families,” Cynthia Chavez Lamar, the museum’s director, said in the release.
The memorial is the first national landmark that focuses on the military contributions of Native Americans, Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians, according to the release. Designed by Native artist and veteran Harvey Pratt, the memorial depicts a circle resting on a carved stove drum. The design also features water for ceremonies, benches for gathering, and lances where visitors can tie prayer cloths.
The dedication ceremony was delayed for two years due to the pandemic, according to CNN affiliate KLTV.
“This country is our county, and our duty is to serve our country,” said veteran and Alabama-Coushatta Tribe member Roland Poncho, according to KLTV. “Especially in Vietnam… out of the 42,000 Native Americans serving in Vietnam, 90% were volunteers.”
“The Native Americans have been placed in different areas where economic development is not possible,” said Poncho. “Over a period of time we have overcome those barriers, and the main thing is being visible and being recognized. This is one more way in which recognition is given.”
The National Museum of the American Indian is also currently showing an exhibition dedicated to Native veterans, called, “Why We Serve: Native Americans in the United States Armed Forces.”

New York returns nearly 200 looted antiquities to Pakistan
Updated 14th November 2022

Written by
Zoe Sottile, CNN
The Manhattan district attorney's office has returned 192 looted antiquities with a value of nearly $3.4 million to Pakistan.
District Attorney Alvin L. Bragg, Jr. announced the repatriation in a press release on Thursday.
US museums return trove of looted treasures to Nigeria
The return is the culmination of a years-long investigation into the sale of artifacts looted from countries all over the world. According to the release, 187 of the items are linked to the Indian American antiquities dealer Subhash Kapoor, who stands accused of running a multi-million-dollar trafficking network via his Manhattan gallery, Art of the Past.
The district attorney's office returned the antiquities during a repatriation ceremony on Thursday at the Pakistan Consulate in New York, according to the release.

""These remarkable works of art were ruthlessly removed from their rightful home and trafficked without regard for their immense cultural and spiritual value,"" said Ivan J. Arvelo, New York special agent in charge at Homeland Security Investigations (HSI).
Earlier this month, Kapoor was sentenced by an Indian court to 10 years in prison for smuggling offenses. He has also been indicted alongside seven co-defendants in the US, where investigators say he helped traffic thousands of treasures stolen from temples, ruins and archaeological sites across Asia.
The Manhattan district attorney's Antiquities Trafficking Unit has seized more than 2,500 artifacts, worth an estimated $143 million, as part of its investigations into Kapoor. Speaking to CNN earlier this month, the disgraced dealer's lawyer said he intends to challenge attempts to extradite his client to the US.
According to Consul General Ayesha Ali, Thursday's repatriation ceremony follows an earlier return of 45 stolen artifacts, linked to another convicted smuggler, to Pakistan.
Dozens of artifacts seized from the Metropolitan Museum of Art
""We began this journey with the DA's Office and (the Department of Homeland Security) in November 2020, 45 pieces of stolen Gandhara artifacts were returned and today we are very fortunate that another batch of 192 antiquities valued at $3.4 million are being returned,"" Ali said in the release.
The objects returned on Thursday include ""Mehrgarh dolls,"" which are some of the oldest known human-crafted figurines in the world. The ancient statues were looted from a Neolithic archaeological site in Pakistan, according to the release.
This article has been updated with further information about the investigation and legal proceedings against Subhash Kapoor.

TASTING THE WORLD
These Japanese beef croquettes are so popular there's a 30-year waitlist

(CNN) — If you order a box of frozen Kobe beef croquettes from Asahiya, a family-run butcher shop in Takasago City in western Japan's Hyogo Prefecture, it'll take another 30 years before you receive your order.
That isn't a typo. Thirty. Years.
Founded in 1926, Asahiya sold meat products from Hyogo prefecture -- Kobe beef included -- for decades before adding beef croquettes to the shelf in the years following WWII.
But it wasn't until the early 2000s that these deep-fried potato and beef dumplings became an internet sensation, resulting in the ridiculously long wait buyers now face.
An unprofitable business idea
The highly coveted ""Extreme Croquettes"" are one of four types of Kobe beef croquettes available at Asahiya. Can't wait three decades? The shop's Premier Kobe Beef Croquettes currently have a more palatable four-year waitlist.
""We started selling our products through online shopping in 1999,"" explains Shigeru Nitta, third-generation owner of Asahiya. ""At that time, we offered Extreme Croquettes as a trial.""
Growing up in Hyogo, Nitta has been visiting the local ranches and beef auctions with his father since he was young.
He took over the shop from his father in 1994 when he was 30 years old.
After experimenting with e-commerce for a few years, he realized customers were hesitant to pay a hefty sum for prime beef online.
Shigeru Nitta is the third-generation owner of Asahiya.
Asahiya
That was when he made a bold decision.
""We sold Extreme Croquettes at the price of JPY270 ($1.8) per piece... The beef in them alone costs about JPY400 ($2.7) per piece,"" says Nitta.
""We made affordable and tasty croquettes that demonstrate the concept of our shop as a strategy to have customers enjoy the croquettes and then hope that they would buy our Kobe beef after the first try.""
To limit the financial loss in the beginning, Asahiya only produced 200 croquettes in their own kitchen next to their shop each week.
""We sell the beef raised by the people we know. Our shop only sells meat that was produced in Hyogo Prefecture, whether it's Kobe beef, Kobe pork or Tajima chicken. This has been the style of the shop since before I became the owner,"" says Nitta.

In fact, Nitta's grandfather used to ride to Sanda -- another famous Wagyu-breeding area in Hyogo -- by bike with a handcart to pick up the produce himself.
""Since around that period our shop had connections with local beef producers, so we did not have to get them from outside the prefecture,"" Nitta adds.
Production boosted but popularity grows
The cheap price tag of the Extreme Croquettes flies in the face of the quality of the ingredients. They're made fresh daily with no preservatives. Ingredients include three-year-old female A5-ranked Kobe beef and potatoes sourced from a local ranch.
Nitta says he has encouraged the ranch to use cow manure to grow the potatoes. The stems of the potatoes will then be fed to the cows, creating a cycle.
Eventually, his unique concept caught the attention of locals and media. When a report about Asahiya's croquettes came out in the early 2000s, their popularity skyrocketed.
""We stopped selling them in 2016 because the waiting time became over 14 years. We were thinking of stopping orders, but we got many calls requesting to keep offering them,"" says Nitta.
Extreme croquettes are made with three-year-old female A5-ranked Kobe beef.
Asahiya
Asahiya resumed accepting orders for these croquettes in 2017 but raised the price.
""At that time, we raised the price to JPY500 ($3.4)-JPY540 ($3.7) with consumption tax. But since the export of Kobe beef began, the prices of beef have doubled, so the fact that the production of croquettes makes a deficit has not changed,"" says Nitta.
Production has also been boosted from 200 croquettes a week to 200 croquettes per day.
""In reality, the Extreme Croquettes got way more popular than other products,"" Nitta chuckles, laughing at his own money-losing business idea.
""We hear that we should hire more people and make croquettes more quickly, but I think there is no shop owner who hires employees and produce more to make more deficit... I feel sorry for having them wait. I do want to make croquettes quickly and send them as soon as possible, but if I do, the shop will go bankrupt.""
Fortunately, Nitta says that about half of the people who try the croquettes end up ordering their Kobe beef, so it's a sound marketing strategy.

Nitta's mission: Let more people enjoy Kobe beef
Each box of Extreme Croquettes, which includes five pieces, sells for JPY2,700 ($18.40).
The shop sends a regular newsletter to waiting customers updating them on the latest shipping estimate.
A week before the delivery date, the shop will confirm the delivery with the patient customers once again.
""Of course, some people have changed their email addresses. For those people, we call them directly and let them know the delivery date. They can change their address themselves through our website or when we call them, they can let us know,"" says Nitta.
Customers receiving croquettes these days placed their orders about 10 years ago.
Having a 30-year list of unprofitable orders to fulfill can be stressful, especially as the price of Kobe beef and labor continues to rise.
But something more important has encouraged Nitta to keep going.
The waiting time for these frozen Extreme Croquettes is around 30 years at the moment.
Asahiya
""When I started selling croquettes on the internet, I got many orders from remote isolated islands. Most of them had heard of Kobe beef on TV but had never had them because they had to go to cities if they want to try it. I realized that there were so many people who have never had Kobe beef.
""For that reason, I continued offering croquettes as a trial and get more orders for Kobe beef if they liked it. That was why I started it in the first place, so I didn't really care if it was a deficit,"" says Nitta.
One of the most memorable moments was when they got an order from a cancer patient who was about to go through surgery while waiting for their Extreme Croquettes.
""I heard that our croquettes were the patient's motivation to go through surgery. That surprised me the most,"" says Nitta.
The patient survived and placed multiple orders since then.
Nitta received a call from the patient who told him ""I hope to live long without reoccurrence of cancer"" after sampling his croquettes.
""I still remember that. I was moved by the comment,"" says Nitta.
By letting more people enjoy Kobe beef, he hopes that the fame of these croquettes will help promote the local industry.
""I'm grateful. By becoming famous, I think I can help the whole industry, not just my shop, by making people who have not been interested in Kobe beef get interested. I want to have as many people as possible eat Kobe beef -- not just from my shop,"" says Nitta.
How to sample beef croquettes now
Asahiya now has two locations: their original store at Takasago City and a shop in Kobe city. Its frozen beef croquettes are only shipped domestically.
Though Asahiya primarily operates as a butcher, Nitta says travelers can visit their Kobe shop, where they sell two types of ready-to-eat takeaway snacks, called ""Tor Road"" and ""Kitanozaka"" croquettes, named after nearby streets.
""Kitanozaka"" uses lean beef and is priced at JPY360 ($2.5) each. ""Tor Road"" uses short loin and chuck, and costs JPY460 ($3.1).
""We age the meat for 40 days and the potatoes for one month so that they will be sweeter,"" says Nitta.
As for the future, the 58-year-old owner says they're thinking about expanding.
""I would like to make a small space where people can eat a bit, maybe. Our Kobe shop is a tourist spot,"" he says. ""But if it becomes a restaurant, our neighboring restaurants might be annoyed because we supply the meat for them too.""

Sandy Hook memorial opens to public, nearly 10 years after 26 killed in elementary school shooting
By Zenebou Sylla and Emma Tucker, CNN
Updated 9:49 PM EST, Sun November 13, 2022

 — 
A memorial honoring the 20 first graders and six educators killed in the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting opened to the public on Sunday, nearly a month before the 10-year commemoration.
The Sandy Hook Permanent Memorial, designed by Dan Affleck and Ben Waldo, was unveiled publicly in Newtown, Connecticut where the mass shooting took place on December 14, 2012.
The memorial consists of a “circling network” of paths that lead visitors through woodland, across ponds and meadows to the center – a fountain that sits in a granite basin engraved with the names of the victims, according to its description on the designers’ website.
“Water flows spiral inwards towards a planter at the center, where a young sycamore is planted to symbolize the young age of the victims. The motion of the water embraces the tree and captures the energy, form, and cycle of the landscape around it,” the website says.
“Visitors are encouraged to give a candle or a flower to the water, which will carry the offering across the space in an act of bridging the deceased and the living,” it continues.

The design was selected out of 189 submissions by the Sandy Hook Permanent Memorial Commission after a five-year process.
Jennifer Hubbard, whose daughter Catherine Violet Hubbard was six years old when she was killed in shooting, told CNN on Sunday that she first viewed the memorial a few weeks ago and then again on Saturday for the memorial’s official dedication for the victims’ loved ones.
“I’m grateful that Catherine is a part of the memorial because it is a shared and sacred loss of 26 families,” Hubbard told CNN.
Hubbard said she appreciates the Newtown Memorial Commission and those involved for creating the tribute.
She describes the quiet space as “beautifully appointed” to reflect on the lives taken and affected by the shooting.
“This memorial goes beyond being a marker of all that we’ve been through,” Hubbard said.
“It’s a reminder of all that we as a community have come together to accomplish. This is a collective space for reflection where all who visit are reminded of the healing, love and compassion we’ve sought to bring to the world,” she continued.
Hubbard founded an animal sanctuary in her daughter Catherine’s honor. She hopes projects such as hers and that of the public memorial may show “humanity and human[s] are good.”

21 of Europe's most underrated places

Norwich, England: Packed with pubs, churches and cultural offerings, charming Norwich is well worth a visit. Click through the gallery for 20 more overlooked destinations in Europe:

(CNN) — Sure, there's plenty of joy to be found sipping espresso outside a Parisian cafe or eating tapas in the heart of Barcelona.
But Europe is also full of so many wonderful, underrated places. Whether you want to visit historic, overlooked cities or wild mountain ranges where few tourists tread, these 21 underrated European destinations are bound to induce a serious bout of wanderlust.
Norwich, England
It's said that Norwich has a pub for every day of the year and a church for every Sunday. Its cathedral, dating to 1096, is certainly one of the most spectacular in England, with peregrine falcons nesting on its sky-high spire. The Adam and Eve pub, just next door, first started serving ale in 1249.
From its looming castle to St. Andrew's and Blackfriars' Halls (a 14th-century religious complex including a friary church and convent), the city center's medieval architecture lends the place a truly magical atmosphere.
Throw in first-rate culture, thanks to the University of East Anglia and award-winning independent Arts Center, and you've got a city that it would be a crime to miss when visiting the United Kingdom.

North Uist, Scotland
The beach at Baleloch on North Uist is among the island's natural attractions. There's ancient history, too.
Federica Violin/Adobe Stock
It takes a while to reach the wild expanse of North Uist in Scotland's Outer Hebrides islands, one hour and 45 minutes by ferry from the Isle of Skye, to be precise. But it's definitely worth the effort.
On the journey over, you're sure to see seals galore, as the island off Scotland's west coast is home to the largest breeding colony in Europe.
Every year, about 9,000 pups are born. Check out the looming Pobull Fhinn stone circle and 5,000-year-old Barpa Langass burial chamber before heading out on a sea kayak to explore the rugged coastline.
Irish Midlands
The Wild Atlantic Way, which stretches along Ireland's west coast from Cork to Donegal, is rightly lauded for its relentless scenery and epic beauty. But away from the coast there's a quieter, understated landscape that sees fewer visitors: the Irish Midlands.
The landlocked counties of Longford, Offaly, Westmeath and Laois offer gorgeous lakes, expansive bog lands replete with bird life, as well as the spectacular ruined monastery of Clonmacnoise. Founded by St. Ciarán in 544, its churches and crosses are some of the most historic in Ireland.
Orange, France
Avignon, just a few miles south, gets plenty of plaudits for its perfectly preserved old town Papal Palace. However, Orange is home to something just as fabulous: a Roman theater that dates back to the first century AD.
Perfectly preserved, it still plays home to an annual opera festival. When singers aren't taking to the stage, visitors can explore the theater's upper reaches, with huge views across town and the surrounding wine country.
Basel, Switzerland
Zurich's wonderful lake is a summer hotspot, but Basel is an underrated Swiss gem, thanks in large part to being able to swim in the Rhine here over the summer. It's possible to float for over two miles along this most famous of European rivers, slipping in by the Museum Tinguely and taking in the sights from a frog's eye view.
Stuff belongings in a Wickelfisch, a trademarked ""original Basel"" dry bag, and it's possible to get from A to B without having to leave valuables on the bank. Sunbathing spots and cafes mean it's possible to make a day of this most languid of activities.

Apuseni Mountains, Romania

Part of the Western Carpathian range in Transylvania, the Apuseni Mountains are one of Europe's most unspoiled wildernesses. Home to a large population of European brown bears, as well as wolves, its woodland and mountains feel way off the beaten track but are a short drive from the city of Cluj.
Adventurous visitors can try their hand at the numerous via ferrata, permanent climbing routes that offer amazing views of this special corner of the continent.
Zagori, Greece
Meaning ""the place behind the mountains,"" Zagori escaped Turkish rule and maintained its independence during the Ottoman period. Walking its myriad trails and descending the Vikos Gorge, some 900 meters (2,953 feet) deep, it's easy to see why.
This is a wild, untamed place in northwestern mainland Greece where mountain goats hop between vertiginous platforms and lush woodland abounds. It's not all wilderness, though. Its picture postcard villages and ancient bridges make it ideal for exploring from behind the wheel of a 4x4 or on a scooter.

Patmos, Greece
Beautiful beaches and traditional architecture are part of the allure in the main town of Skala on Patmos island.

Found at the northernmost tip of the Dodecanese islands, Patmos is famed for being the place where St. John wrote the Book of Revelation. Cruise ships disgorge passengers into coaches that head to the Cave of the Apocalypse, where John is said to have received the visions that inspired his famous biblical text, before heading straight back again.
Those in the know, however, come here for a longer stay. The beaches around the main town of Skala are beautiful, with waterside tavernas serving up fresh squid and ice cold beer.
Henne Strand, Denmark
The west coast of Jutland, Denmark, has long been a go to for Danes looking for a wholesome summer holiday. Henne Strand's wide expanse of sand, crashing waves and bracing wind make it a classic northern European getaway.
Throw in Filsø lake and easy access to the Blaabjerg Plantation, a nature reserve crisscrossed with bike trails, and Henne Strand is a true Danish icon. Foodies will love the bakeries and coffee spots, not to mention Henne Kirkeby Kro, a two-star Michelin restaurant found just inland.
Nellim and Lake Inari, Finland
This part of northern Finland is a prime spot to see the northern lights.

The northern reaches of Finland are famed for being one of the best places in the Arctic Circle for catching a glimpse of aurora borealis, the northern lights.
But this part of Finnish Lapland, home to the Indigneous Sami people, is glorious all year round. The area around Nellim and Lake Inari is remote and wild, perfect for kayaking, camping and swimming. The fall colors here are some of the most stunning in the world.
Antwerp, Belgium
Brussels and Bruges get plenty of attention from tourists. But Antwerp more than rivals its fellow Belgian cities. One of the most vital trading posts in Europe during the 15th and 16th centuries, it remains the center of the world diamond trade.
Its towering Cathedral of Our Lady, completed in 1521, is home to work by Rubens, and the superb Red Star Line Museum, housed in a former shipping office, tells the story of the millions of people who came through Antwerp in the 19th and early 20th centuries, leaving persecution in search of a better life in America.
Wiesbaden, Germany
Sparkling wine and thermal spas are two good reasons to visit Wiesbaden.

Home to 26 thermal spas, Wiesbaden was in the business of wellness long before it became a 21st-century travel trend. This pretty town, though, isn't just about soothing aching joints and rest and recuperation. It's also known for its sekt, sparkling wine made in the lush surrounding countryside.
Connoisseurs claim it's every bit as good as Champagne. Nearby Schloss Vollrads has been producing wine since the late 1100s and makes for a relaxing stop off on a dedicated wine tour.
Picos de Europa, Spain
The majestic Picos de Europa in northern Spain serve up some of Spain's most beguiling scenery. Oak and beech trees crowd the lower reaches of this mountain range, where soaring, jagged peaks ascend toward the heavens.
Its 30 self-guided routes are rich reward for hikers, with few encounters with other humans likely and the chance to spot Iberian wolves and brown bears. Spain's only human inhabited nature reserve, the 11 villages here offer a glimpse into a simpler, rural life.
Sardinia, Italy
The medieval town of Castelsardo in Sardinia is a dazzling spot to tuck into the island's abundant seafood.
Balate Dorin/Adobe Stock
Any trip to Italy must put food front and center. And that's especially true of the island of Sardinia, which blends Italian culture with Catalan, North African and French flavors.
Seafood, inevitably, is a big deal along the coast, with clams, sardines and sea urchins abounding. Goat and lamb, grilled over open flames, are a delicacy, as is maialino arrosto, suckling pig made with myrtle and juniper. Visitors should also try panadas, Sardinian pies that herald from the village of Assemini. Gnocchi, such as malloreddus flavored with saffron, is another essential dish.

Vilnius, Lithuania
There's so much to love about the Baltic states of Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania. But the latter's capital, found inland rather than on the coast like the Latvian capital Riga and Estonia's Tallinn, can often get overlooked. And that's a real shame, as this is a truly wonderful city.
The baroque architecture on show is some of the finest in Europe, while the cathedral in the heart of town draws its origins back to the 13th century. There's a warm, welcoming and energetic vibe here, thanks in no small part to the buzzing student population. Grab a beer and soak it all up.
Rotterdam, Netherlands
The industrial city of Rotterdam has a thriving food scene.

Amsterdam has been at the center of an overtourism crisis for years. And while the Dutch capital is undoubtedly beautiful, Rotterdam is a fascinating alternative.
This industrial city has one of Europe's most thriving food scenes. Katendrecht, a former red light district on a quay in the city center, has a great array of options, from gourmet burgers to the best tacos this side of the Atlantic.
The Deliplein plaza has more than 20 restaurants and bars, serving everything from steak to Thai curry, while the nearby Fenix Food Factory is the place to pick up local produce and sample delicious ciders with small plates.
Kalmar, Sweden
Sweden's vastness means it can be hard to decide where to stop and take it all in. Kalmar is a great option. This historic city on the country's southeast coast not only has one of the most beautiful castles in Scandinavia but is also ideal for those keen on outdoor adventure.
The 200-kilometer (124-mile) Kalmarsundsleden trail is perfect for exploring by foot or on two wheels, while the beaches on the surrounding islands are heaven in high summer. Throw in Swedish cinnamon buns and classic dishes at the fancy Postgatan restaurant, and you've got the makings of a dream vacation.
Białowieża National Park, Poland
Visitors to Poland tend to make for the bright lights of Warsaw and Krakow. Yet in the far east of the country, Białowieża National Park is waiting to be explored.
The park has enjoyed protected status for over 100 years and is home to the largest population of European bison on the continent. It's the best-preserved part of the wider Białowieża Forest, ancient woodland that has fast disappeared in recent centuries. For nature lovers, this is an escape that's not to be missed.
Pristina, Kosovo
The Balkans have so much to recommend them, from wild islands along the Dalmatian coast to challenging hikes across its mountain ranges. And the Kosovan capital, Pristina, is hugely underrated.
It has a booming cafe culture, serving up coffee that would make the finest Aussie baristas proud. Soma Book Station stands out from the crowd. Meanwhile, the vast swimming pool in Germia Park is a hip hangout during the summer.
Pula, Croatia
An ancient Roman arch stands in a sunny square in Pula, Croatia -- a worthy alternative to crowded Dubrovnik.

Dubrovnik's beauty can sometimes be offset by the hordes that crowd its ancient walls. But farther north, Croatia has another beautiful city which doesn't feel overrun.
Pula, on the Istrian peninsula, has sweeping views over the Adriatic as well as Roman ruins at every turn and spectacular beaches. The cuisine takes its cues from Italy (of which Istria was part until 1947) and the local wine is to die for.

Bansko, Bulgaria
Skiing in the Alps, whether in France, Switzerland or Austria, can be a brilliant yet punishingly expensive business. That's where Bansko comes in. The largest skiing area in Bulgaria, it has some of the best winter sports action in Europe and passes for the pistes that don't leave bank balances depleted.
The snow here is great, and the après ski action more than matches that of classic resorts in Western Europe.

At least 16 high school hockey players were injured after an allegedly intoxicated semi-truck driver crashed into their team bus

 — 
At least 16 junior varsity hockey players from Illinois were injured Saturday night in Warsaw, Indiana after an allegedly intoxicated semi-truck driver swerved into the team’s bus, knocking it onto its side.
Three of the injured high school students, who attend St. Ignatius College Prep, underwent surgery and were initially considered to be in critical condition, the school said in a statement. Warsaw is about 120 miles southwest from Chicago.
The Warsaw Police Department was notified of a tractor trailer swerving into other lanes and driving at excessive speed shortly after 8 p.m., according to a Sunday news release. Police were on their way to stop the truck when it struck the school bus in its rear.
Eyewitnesses and a surveillance camera showed the semi-truck driver ran a red light seconds before crashing into the bus as it was turning, police said. At least one of the students was ejected from the bus during the crash, Warsaw police added.

Police detected “a strong odor” of alcohol on the truck driver and said he was slurring and failed sobriety tests, the release said. The truck driver refused to consent to a chemical test, according to police.
The truck driver, a 58-year-old man from New York, remains in custody on a 48-hour hold as his blood sample were sent out for official testing. The driver faces felony charges pertaining to operating while intoxicated and causing serious bodily injury, according to police.
There were a total of 23 students, two coaches, and the driver on the rented school bus, police said, adding the students’ ages “range between 14 and 17 years old, with most children 15 years of age.”
“We will get through this together,” the Saint Ignatius Wolfpack Hockey Club said in the statement.
Saint Ignatius is a private Jesuit high school near Chicago whose JV hockey team was traveling across state lines for a weekend tournament in Culver. According to police, the team had dinner in Warsaw before heading to their hotel.

Dolly Parton receives $100 million Courage and Civility Award from Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez

 — 
Dolly Parton is the latest recipient of the Bezos Courage and Civility Award.
“Jeff [Bezos] and I are so proud to share that we have a new Bezos Courage and Civility Award winner — a woman who gives with her heart and leads with love and compassion in every aspect of her work,” Bezos’ longtime partner, Lauren Sanchez, posted on Instagram alongside a video of their speech Friday before awarding the grant to the country music legend and longtime philanthropist.
“We can’t wait to see all the good that you’re going to do with this $100 million award, @DollyParton.”
Parton, who has donated to various causes for decades, publicly thanked Bezos and Sanchez on Twitter.
“I try to put my money where my heart is. I will do my best to do good things with this money,” Parton tweeted. “Thank you @JeffBezos #LaurenSanchez”
During the Covid-19 pandemic, Parton donated $1 million to Vanderbilt University Medical Center’s vaccine research efforts. It was partly used to fund Moderna’s Covid-19 vaccine.
She said in an interview at the time with BBC’s “The One Show,” that she felt “honored and proud.”
“I just felt so proud to have been part of that little seed money that will hopefully grow into something great and help to heal this world,” she said. “I’m a very proud girl today to know I had anything at all to do with something that’s going to help us through this crazy pandemic.”
In 1988, Parton established the Dollywood Foundation, and eventually The Imagination Library, a program that helps children across the world access books.
Among her philanthropic efforts in her home state of Tennessee, Parton also created the Dolly Parton Scholarship, which provides $15,000 to recipients towards a college education.
Last year, Bezos awarded $100 million each to CNN contributor Van Jones and chef José Andrés.
Bezos, the founder and former head of Amazon.com, said at a news conference at the time the grant had no strings attached.
“They can give it all to their own charity,” Bezos said last year. “Or they can share the wealth. It is up to them.”

Biden rides midterm validation into high-stakes meeting with Xi
By Phil Mattingly, CNN
Published 5:45 PM EST, Sun November 13, 2022

'Very good news' for Biden: CNN projects Democrats will keep control of Senate
03:05 - Source: CNN
CNN
 — 
Thirty-seven minutes after wrapping up a late-night gala dinner with Asian leaders – punctuated by plates of wild Mekong lobster and beef saraman – an aide handed President Joe Biden the phone.
On the other end of the line was David Trone, the millionaire Maryland wine retailer who was thousands of miles and a time zone 12 hours away and had just clinched another term in the House.
The call wasn’t long, a person familiar with it said, but reflected the warmth and enthusiasm Biden had deployed dozens of times in calls to winning candidates over the last week – each one further solidifying a midterm election that dramatically reshaped the prevailing view of his presidency.
“There wasn’t anybody who wasn’t running on what we did,” Biden told reporters in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, shortly after Democrats clinched another two years of Senate control – and another round of congratulatory calls. “So I feel good, and I’m looking forward to the next couple of years.”
As Washington grapples with the domestic repercussions of a voter-induced electoral earthquake that kept the Senate in Democratic hands and has put the inevitability of Republican House control on the shakiest of ground, the most significant near-term effect is palpable here, on Biden’s long-scheduled foreign trip where the first face-to-face meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping is taking place.
US national security adviser Jake Sullivan provided a glimpse into dynamics of the moment, pointing to the fact “that many leaders took note of the results of the midterms, came up to the president to engage him and to say that they were following them closely.”
As Biden met with Asian leaders in the lead up to his meeting with Xi, those conversations provided a critical boost.
“I would say one theme that emerged over the course of the two days was the theme about the strength of American democracy and what this election said about American democracy,” Sullivan told reporters aboard Air Force One as Biden traveled from Phnom Penh to Bali, Indonesia, for the Group of 20 Summit.
White House officials, even those who braced for losses in the weeks leading up to election day, have cast aside any reticence to take to their Twitter accounts or to TV interviews to call out pundits and politicians who predicted otherwise.
It’s a reflection – abroad and back in Washington – of a team that officials acknowledge feels constantly underestimated and has long coveted unambiguous success after a relentless and crisis-infused first 21 months in office.
But on the other side of the world, Biden’s advisers say there has been a tangible effect tied to election results that, had they matched historical trends, threatened to undermine his standing ahead of the most consequential meeting of his first two years.
A very different split-screen moment
White House officials had been circling the G-20 as the likely sit-down with Xi for months. There were intensive preparations between the two sides in the lead up to announcing the engagement publicly. The tenuous state of the relationship necessitated a sit down, regardless of domestic politics.
In the weeks leading up to the election, White House advisers downplayed the effect sweeping midterm losses would have on the weight of Biden’s presence and message abroad, citing the same historical trends they would later buck.
But privately, multiple people familiar with the matter said, there was an awareness of the potential split screen of a US president grappling with his party’s political defeat at the same moment Xi would arrive in Bali at the peak of his power in the wake of the Community Party Congress, during which he secured a norm-breaking third term in power.
“Perception matters and so does political standing,” one US official said. “It’s not the be-all, end-all, and it was never a central focus or driver of the dynamics, but we’re well aware of the fact everyone was watching this election around the world.”
Far from a liability, however, each of the congratulatory calls back home have underscored the driving wind at the back of a president who entered the meeting with Xi at a moment where US-China relations appear to be inching away from great power competition toward inevitable conflict.
Asked if the results put him in a stronger position heading into the meeting, Biden didn’t hesitate.
“I know I’m stronger,” Biden said, before noting that given his long-standing relationship with Xi formed during their times as their nations’ vice president that the results weren’t a necessity for the meeting to achieve its goals. US officials are also careful not to overstate the effect on a trip – and in a region – where the layers of complexity and challenges far exceed what voters decide in a congressional district or swing state.
Biden aims to highlight US democracy against Xi’s autocracy
Yet Biden isn’t subtle about his sweeping view of the geopolitical stakes of a moment he’s repeatedly framed as a generational “inflection point,” centered on the battle between democracy and autocracy.
While his advisers have moved to frame that construct broadly, Biden has made clear the leading autocracy that animates the strategy and policy across nearly every corner of his administration is Xi’s China.
Implicit in a White House mood that has only seemed to grow more buoyant with each new day of called races, the election results prove Biden’s theory of the case is, to some degree, actually working – that an American political landscape that served to rattle allies and foes alike over the last several years was, in fact, stabilizing.
Biden has put the high-stakes competition with China at the center of his engagements with foreign leaders, pressing allies by phone and in person to take a sharper line. US officials have sought new pathways to gain the upper hand in the proxy economic and technological competition happening between the two powers over developing regions and neutral parties.
But officials have also experienced an unmistakable – and according to many, understandable – hesitancy.
“What I find is that they want to know: Is the United States stable? Do we know what we’re about? Are we the same democracy we’ve always been?” Biden said at his post-election news conference as he described his conversations with world leaders.
After his meeting with Xi, Biden attempted to answer his own questions.
Speaking of his time in Asia and meeting with world leaders, Biden said the election has sent “a very strong message around the world that the United States is ready to play” and “fully engaged in the world.”
“There was a strong rejection of political violence and voter intimidation, and there was an emphatic statement that in America, the will of the people prevails,” Biden said.
The president added, “What these elections showed is there’s a deep and unwavering commitment in America to preserving and protecting and defending democracy.”
Midterms provide Biden the validation he’s wanted
Up until Election Day, allies and foes alike were in large part left to take Biden at his word when he attempted to answer those questions with an emphatic, “Yes.”
Former President Donald Trump, whose election lies had driven the assault on the US Capitol, hadn’t faded away and he remained the most powerful figure inside the Republican Party.
Biden had navigated the narrowest of congressional majorities to enact a sweeping domestic agenda, a chunk of which was done on a bipartisan basis. Yet he still held an approval rating in the low 40s, weighed down by four-decade high inflation and a population exhausted by years careening from crisis to crisis.
The possibility that Biden would face the same harsh judgment of his first two years in office as nearly all his recent predecessors wasn’t just likely. It was expected.
Instead, as he moved through bilateral meetings and pull-asides, gala dinners and summit gatherings, Biden’s own political vindication served another purpose for his approach on the world stage: Validation.
Biden “feels that it does establish a strong position for him on the international stage and we saw that I think play out in living color today,” Sullivan told reporters after Biden departed the ASEAN-US Summit, as the Xi meeting loomed. “I think we’ll see that equally when we head into both the G20 and to his bilateral engagements in Bali.”
Biden’s final day in Phnom Penh included a pull-aside meeting with Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and critical meetings with the leaders of Japan and South Korea – all of which included a focus on China.
But in between, he found a couple of minutes to hop back on the phone.
Nevada Rep. Dina Titus, who faced a tough reelection battle in a redrawn district, had secured another term in office. Biden needed to pass along his congratulations.

 — 
A little over a year ago, social media companies were put on notice for how they protect, or fail to protect, their youngest users.
In a series of congressional hearings, executives from Facebook (FB), TikTok, Snapchat and Instagram faced tough questions from lawmakers over how their platforms can lead younger users to harmful content, damage mental health and body image (particularly among teenage girls), and lacked sufficient parental controls and safeguards to protect teens.
Those hearings, which followed disclosures in what became known as the “Facebook Papers” from whistleblower Frances Haugen about Instagram’s impact on teens, prompted the companies to vow to change. The four social networks have since introduced more tools and parental control options aimed at better protecting younger users. Some have also made changes to their algorithms, such as defaulting teens into seeing less sensitive content and increasing their moderation efforts. But some lawmakers, social media experts and psychologists say the new solutions are still limited, and more needs to be done.
“More than a year after the Facebook Papers dramatically revealed Big Tech’s abuse, social media companies have made only small, slow steps to clean up their act,” Sen. Richard Blumenthal, who chairs the Senate’s consumer protection subcommittee, told CNN Business. “Trust in Big Tech is long gone and we need real rules to ensure kids’ safety online.”
Parents of the social media generation are not OK
Michela Menting, a digital security director at market research firm ABI Research, agreed that social media platforms are “offering very little of substance to counter the ills their platforms incur.” Their solutions, she said, put the onus on guardians to activate various parental controls,such as those intended to filter, block and restrict access, and more passive options, such as monitoring and surveillance tools that run in the background.
Alexandra Hamlet, a New York City-based clinical psychologist, recalls being invited to a roundtable discussion roughly 18 months ago to discuss ways to improve Instagram, in particular, for younger users. “I don’t see many of our ideas being implemented,” she said. Social media platforms, she added, need to work on “continuing to improve parental controls, protect young people against targeted advertising, and remove objectively harmful content.”
The social media companies featured in this piece either declined to comment or did not respond to a request for comment on criticism that more needs to be done to protect young users.
For now, guardians must learn how to use the parental controls while also being mindful that teens can often circumvent those tools. Here’s a closer look at what parents can do to help keep their kids safe online.
Instagram
After the fallout from the leaked documents, Meta-owned Instagram paused its much-criticized plan to release a version of Instagram for kids under age 13 and focused on making its main service safer for young users.
It has since introduced an educational hub for parents with resources, tips and articles from experts on user safety, and rolled out a tool that allows guardians to see how much time their kids spend on Instagram and set time limits. Parents can also receive updates on what accounts their teens follow and the accounts that follow them, and view and be notified if their child makes an update to their privacy and account settings. Parents can see which accounts their teens have blocked, as well. The company also provides video tutorials on how to use the new supervision tools.
Another feature encourages users to take a break from the app, such as suggesting they take a deep breath, write something down, check a to-do list or listen to a song, after a predetermined amount of time. Instagram also said it’s taking a “stricter approach” to the content it recommends to teens and will actively nudge them toward different topics, such as architecture and travel destinations, if they’ve been dwelling on any type of content for too long.
Facebook
Their teenage children died by suicide. Now these families want to hold social media companies accountable
Facebook’s Safety Center provides supervision tools and resources, such as articles and advice from leading experts. “Our vision for Family Center is to eventually allow parents and guardians to help their teens manage experiences across Meta technologies, all from one place,” Liza Crenshaw, a Meta spokesperson, told CNN Business.
The hub also offers a guide to Meta’s VR parental supervision tools from ConnectSafely, a nonprofit aimed at helping kids stay safe online, to assist parents with discussing virtual reality with their teens. Guardians can see which accounts their teens have blocked and access supervision tools, as well as approve their teen’s download or purchase of an app that is blocked by default based on its rating, or block specific apps that may be inappropriate for their teen.
Snapchat
In August, Snapchat introduced a parent guide and hub aimed at giving guardians more insight into how their teens use the app, including who they’ve been talking to within the last week (without divulging the content of those conversations). To use the feature, parents must create their own Snapchat account, and teens have to opt-in and give permission.
While this was Snapchat’s first formal foray into parental controls, it did previously have a few existing safety measures for young users, such as requiring teens to be mutual friends before they can start communicating with each other and prohibiting them from having public profiles. Teen users have their Snap Map location-sharing tool off by default but can also use it to disclose their real-time location with a friend or family member even while their app is closed as a safety measure. Meanwhile, a Friend Check Up tool encourages Snapchat users to review their friend lists and make sure they still want to be in touch with certain people.
Snap gives parents the ability to see which new friends their teens have added and allows them to confidentially report concerning accounts that may be interacting with their child. It is also working on a tool to give younger users the option to notify their parents when they report an account or piece of content.
The company told CNN Business it will continue to build on its safety features and consider feedback from the community, policymakers, safety and mental health advocates, and other experts to improve the tools over time.
TikTok
In July, TikTok announced new ways to filter out mature or “potentially problematic” videos. The new safeguards allocated a “maturity score” to videos detected as potentially containing mature or complex themes. It also rolled out a tool that aims to help people decide how much time they want to spend on TikToks. The tool lets users set regular screen time breaks, and provides a dashboard that details the number of times they opened the app, a breakdown of daytime and nighttime usage and more.
'Watchdog moms' on TikTok are trying to keep minors safe
The popular short form video app currently offers a Family Pairing hub, which allows parents and teens to customize their safety settings. A parent can also link their TikTok account to their teen’s app and set parental controls, including how long they can spend on the app each day; restrict exposure to certain content; decide if teens can search for videos, hashtags, or Live content; and whether their account is private or public. TikTok also offers its Guardian’s Guide that highlights how parents can best protect their kids on the platform.
In addition to parental controls, the app restricts access to some features to younger users, such as Live and direct messaging. A pop-up also surfaces when teens under the age of 16 are ready to publish their first video, asking them to choose who can watch the video. Push notifications are curbed after 9 p.m. for account users ages 13 to 15, and 10 p.m. for users ages 16 to 17.
The company said it will be doing more around boosting awareness of its parental control features in the coming days and months.
Discord
Discord did not appear before the Senate last year but the popular messaging platform has faced criticism over difficulty reporting problematic content and the ability of strangers to get in touch with young users.
In response, the company recently refreshed its Safety Center, where parents can find guidance on how to turn on safety settings, FAQs about how Discord works, and tips on how to talk about online safety with teens. Some existing parental control tools include an option to prohibit a minor from receiving a friend request or a direct message from someone they don’t know.
Still, it’s possible for minors to connect with strangers on public servers or in private chats if the person was invited by someone else in the room or if the channel link is dropped into a public group that the user accessed. By default, all users — including users ages 13 to 17 — can receive friend invitations from anyone in the same server, which then opens up the ability for them to send private messages.

 — 
“Black Panther: Wakanda Forever” had the major challenge of following “Black Panther,” one of the biggest blockbusters ever, and had to do so without star Chadwick Boseman, who passed away in 2020.
Despite all of the challenges, “Wakanda Forever” notched a sizable box office opening this weekend. The Marvel movie opened to an estimated $180 million in North America, according to the film’s studio, Disney.
The opening represents one of the best premieres of the year and makes the superhero film the highest-grossing debut ever for the month of November. The original record belonged to “The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,” which made $158 million in November 2013. The box office haul comes in around where most in Hollywood were predicting.
The film has made $330 million globally so far.
'Black Panther: Wakanda Forever' pulls off a difficult dive after Chadwick Boseman's death
It’s no surprise why “Wakanda Forever” did so well this weekend.
The film, which stars Letitia Wright and Angela Bassett as the princess and queen of the African country of Wakanda, comes from Marvel Studios — the most lucrative brand in all of Hollywood — and is the sequel to one of the most popular films of all time.
When “Black Panther” hit theaters in February 2018, it opened to a stellar $202 million weekend. It then went on to make $1.3 billion worldwide and garnered multiple Oscar nominations, including Best Picture. The film is considered to be one of the best from the comic book genre and one of the best from Marvel.
Audiences also likely bought a ticket to “Wakanda Forever” to see how the film and director Ryan Coogler would handle the passing of Boseman. In an interview with Empire magazine in September, Marvel Studios chief Kevin Feige said “It just felt like it was much too soon” to recast the late actor. Boseman died at age 43 from colon cancer.
As for its critical reception, “Wakanda Forever” notched an 84% score on review site Rotten Tomatoes. Audiences also gave the film an “A” on CinemaScore.
“‘Black Panther: Wakanda Forever’ faced an inordinate degree of difficulty, addressing the tragic death of Chadwick Boseman,” Brian Lowry, CNN’s media critic, wrote in his review. “That the movie manages to strike that somber chord and still deliver as Marvel-style entertainment represents a major accomplishment.”
Disney+ beats subscriber expectations but that growth came at a cost
The film’s solid opening comes at the good time for theaters and Disney.
For theaters, the industry needed a blockbuster to help boost numbers since new, notable films have been hard to find in recent months.
As for Disney, the media giant’s shares sank 13% Wednesday after the company reported its streaming business lost $1.4 billion last quarter, despite growing its subscriber base.
The debut of “Wakanda Forever” will unlikely impact Disney’s stock since investors remain heavily focused on the company’s streaming endeavors. But the strong box office performance helps Disney end a bad week on a high note.
It could also help build momentum for theaters with another potential Disney blockbuster on the horizon next month: “Avatar: The Way of Water.”

Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan says Trump has cost the GOP the last three elections

 — 
Republican Gov. Larry Hogan of Maryland said Sunday that former President Donald Trump has cost the GOP the last three elections and it’s past time to reassess what’s important to the party.
“It’s basically the third election in a row that Donald Trump has cost us the race, and it’s like, three strikes, you’re out,” Hogan said during an appearance on “State of the Union” with CNN’s Dana Bash.
Some past and current Republican members of Congress blame Trump for party's losses, say time to move on in 2024
“This should have been a huge red wave. It should have been one of the biggest red waves we’ve ever had,” added Hogan, who was ineligible to run for a third term in Maryland this year. Despite President Joe Biden’s low approval ratings, the governor said his party “still didn’t perform.”
“I think commonsense conservatives that focused on talking about issues people cared about, like the economy and crime and education, they did win,” Hogan said. “But people who tried to relitigate the 2020 election and focused on conspiracy theories … they were all almost universally rejected.”
Hogan famously did not endorse Dan Cox, the Trump-backed Republican nominee to succeed him as Maryland governor. Cox, who had defeated Hogan’s chosen candidate in the GOP primary, has made false claims of fraud in the 2020 presidential election. Democrats went on to reclaim the governorship of deep-blue Maryland last week, CNN projected, with Wes Moore’s election as the state’s first Black governor.
Hogan stressed the importance of Republicans going back to the drawing board to figure out “a more hopeful, positive vision.”
“We have to get back to a party that appeals to more people, that can win in tough places, like I have done in Maryland,” Hogan said.
Trump’s impact on the party was not lost on Hogan.
“There’s no question, he’s still the 800-pound gorilla, and it’s still a battle,” Hogan said.
Trump mounts anti-McConnell campaign as conservatives seek delay in leadership elections
Asked by Bash if Trump’s looming “special announcement” this week could affect the upcoming Senate runoff in Georgia, Hogan said, “No question about that.”
Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock and Republican challenger Herschel Walker will meet in the December 6 runoff after neither candidate were projected to surpass the 50% vote threshold needed to win the primary outright. The Georgia runoff is not expected to affect the race for Senate control, after CNN projected that Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto would win reelection in Nevada, ensuring that Democrats will hold at least 50 seats. (Vice President Kamala Harris, a Democrat, is able to break any 50-50 ties).
Hogan called Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis “one of the important voices for the party.” DeSantis, who is projected to have comfortably won his bid for a second term last week, is seen as a potential 2024 contender for the GOP presidential contention.
Hogan dodged a question about running for president in 2024, saying, “I still have to do my day job until January 18.”

Miguel Romero says staying in Florida is simply not an option.

This family had big plans for this year. Then Hurricane Ian hit and they were given a deadline to move out of their home

Published 11:51 AM EST, Sun November 13, 2022
CNN
 — 
Miguel Romero proudly calls himself a “Florida boy.”
He loves the Sunshine State’s warm weather. He’s lived in the same neighborhood in Lee County, along Florida’s southwestern coast, for most of his life. It’s where he got his first job, at a Wendy’s, when he was 16. It’s where he drove his first car, a white Buick Century that he bought from his godfather. It’s where he met his partner, Nicole, during senior year of high school.
Together, they now share a 1-year-old daughter, Emma – a name inspired by one of Nicole’s favorite shows, “Friends.” Money was always tight, but life on Linda Loma Drive was good, Romero says.
The family had big plans for this year: they were going to visit an annual Halloween attraction in Orlando. For the first time, Romero was hoping to see his favorite stand-up comedian live later this month. They were hoping to set up their first at-home aquarium in the large fish tank Romero recently purchased.
Someday soon, the couple hoped to get married here, too. But Hurricane Ian changed their plans.
Linda Loma Drive, a short street just 10 minutes away from the island of Fort Myers Beach, is home to predominantly lower- and working-class families, some of them immigrants, whose homes were flooded by the powerful storm in late September.
Like Romero’s family, most of his neighbors are longtime tenants who spent days after the hurricane cleaning their rental homes and piling on their driveways the moldy furniture, electrical devices and cherished memories that the floodwaters destroyed.
Miguel Romero and his partner, Nicole, were told they had to vacate their rental home days after Hurricane Ian.
Erica Lee/CNN
“It was so surreal,” Romero, 26, said on an early October afternoon, as he walked around his empty apartment. “It took us hours and hours to clean all this up and … the big trash trucks with the claws, they just come in, they pick that stuff up like it’s nothing.”
“Years’ worth of hard work gone in a matter of five minutes,” he said.
That wasn’t all they lost. Days after the storm, Romero says his landlord announced they had less than two weeks to move out so that repairs from the flood damage could begin. And he offered no guarantee they’d be able to move back in after those were finished, Romero says. The news came as a gut punch, shattering the image of the life Romero had envisioned for the months and years ahead.
Romero used his savings to rent a storage unit while he frantically looked for a new apartment. But in an area that was already deep in a housing crisis before the hurricane, that quickly proved next to impossible, and his family was forced to look to a different state.
Ian made landfall 20 miles from their mobile home community. Left with scraps and debris, these longtime neighbors wonder what's next
“I’m just sad, heartbroken and hurt,” he said. “Mentally, I’m not in a good place, but I also can’t afford to let my family see that, especially my little girl.”
He wasn’t the only one that was pushed out after the storm. Tenants in several communities across the state’s three hardest-hit counties received orders to vacate their homes, according to reports compiled by the National Low Income Housing Coalition (NLIHC).
Low-income households, which typically receive the “least assistance and fewest protections where recovering,” were those most impacted, the coalition said last month. In states like Florida, where available housing is already scarce, landlords have used natural disasters as opportunities to push those tenants out to fetch higher prices, says Sarah Saadian, the coalition’s senior vice president of public policy and field organizing.
“What happens is that households that are already struggling are pushed deeper into housing instability,” Saadian said. “And the worst cases result in homelessness.”
Nearly two months since the storm ripped through the state, many Floridians who were forced to leave their homes have had to start their lives from scratch, with little money and help in doing so.
‘Tired of being in this tunnel’
For Romero’s family, family trips and plans for new hobbies and shows are now out of reach. Instead, they’re planning to use all their savings for their big move to Indiana on November 19.
“People who spent years saving … in the midst of and in response to an emergency like this when they’re displaced, that money is gone,” said Sheena Rolle, senior director of strategy for local grassroots advocacy group Florida Rising.
Romero said he’s dreading the day of the move. But staying in Florida was simply not an option: the financial assistance the family received from the Federal Emergency Management Agency was not nearly enough to help pay the bills or cover housing, he says. Rent in Indiana is nearly a third of what it is in Florida and family members who already live there told Romero he will likely be able to get a job at a factory.
These Floridians were hit by Hurricane Ian a month ago. Here's what FEMA has done for them so far
“You can only take in so much canned goods, so much water, so much clothes,” Romero said. “What people really need is money. Money to get back on our feet.”
For others, what comes next is a question unanswered.
A 24-year-old mother of three who lived in the same neighborhood says her family was given just days to move out of their home after Ian hit. The woman did not want to be identified for fear of retaliation by her previous landlord, who other family members are also renting from.
The woman tells CNN she moved to the neighborhood with her spouse and their children nearly three years ago – a special milestone that marked the first time the family lived on its own.
In that short time, the family made their house a home, filling it with memories including “Toy Story” and “Minions” movie nights, spaghetti and meatball preparations for when dad returned from work and bedtime rituals for the three young children – 1- and 6-year-old sons and a 2-year-old daughter.
The family evacuated ahead of Hurricane Ian. When they returned, everything was ruined, drenched by more than five feet of floodwater that poured inside the home. They were at least able to save some clothes, the woman says. And then, they found out her spouse was now unemployed after the Sanibel Island restaurant he worked in was decimated.
The woman tells CNN she called her landlord to ask for some more time past October 1 – their usual pay period for rent – while they worked to rearrange their savings. His response: they had two days to get everything out.
“I was crying,” she said. “I didn’t know what I was going to do. We didn’t know where we were going to go.” They have been staying with family since the eviction, the woman says, but that’s a temporary solution and they don’t know where they’ll be able to move to next.
In times of disaster, when local and state governments are often consumed by response efforts, it’s often more likely that some landlords will engage in illegal practices to push tenants out and tenants often don’t have access to legal counsel to fight back, says Saadian, with the NLIHC. That problem is exacerbated by challenges that have existed long before the storms hit, like a lack of renter protections and a lack of enforcement for the protections that do exist, Saadian says.
“The households that are going to be most harmed are those low-income renters who don’t have a lot of options for affordable places to live anyways,” Saadian said. “What we see in many cases is homelessness increases.”
In Houston, after years of declines in the homeless population, advocates recorded a 15% increase in the number of people experiencing homelessness in 2018, the year after Hurricane Harvey pummeled Texas, according to a report from the Coalition for the Homeless. There are still people this year who attribute their homelessness to that storm, the report says.
“Renters whose buildings got impacted or destroyed (in a disaster) have no recourse,” said Rolle, with Florida Rising. “They either must live through what would in any other situation be deemed unlivable conditions or they must flee.”

After disaster, a deadline to leave
On the street behind Romero’s old home, Melissa Harper says she also faces an approaching deadline to leave her house. The neighborhood quickly became a safe haven for Harper, offering a newfound stability after she spent more than a year experiencing homelessness during the Covid-19 pandemic. About a month before the storm hit, Harper moved in with her boyfriend and a good friend of his, a man who had been renting the single-story home for more than a decade.
Much like Romero’s family, the three of them spent the days after the storm cleaning out the destruction. And though most of their furniture and electric devices were gone, they felt hopeful they’d be able to continue living there, adding new pieces of furniture they found at donation drives or on the street.
Several weeks after the storm, their landlord gave them a December 1 deadline to leave, Harper says, adding she was informed he had plans to turn the home into an Airbnb.
“It’s put a lot of pressure on us and a lot of stress. We haven’t saved any money because we had to pay that rent,” she said. “I’m just taking it day by day.”

The latest rounds of evictions after Hurricane Ian highlight a dire need to add more protections for renters, including following disasters, and ensure they have access to housing and financial resources, both Rolle and Saadian tell CNN.
Rep. Val Demings, who last week lost to Sen. Marco Rubio in the election for the US Senate, introduced a bill in September to protect residents from evictions during and after disasters like hurricanes. The bill has been endorsed by organizations including the National Low Income Housing Coalition and the National Housing Law Project.
“At any moment, your life can change and your options are few, but the rules surrounding what you can and can’t do are many,” Rolle said. “Some of this is climate change, some of this is the Earth. A lot of it is bad leadership, bad policy that ignores people at the bottom rung of the ladder.”
Romero hopes coverage of stories like his could bring about some change. The eviction – more than the storm itself – shifted their entire lives and futures. But he tries to remain hopeful about what life in Indiana will look like.
“It’s going to be hard, I mean hard. But I’m just ready for new beginnings,” he said. “Even if we don’t like it, maybe someday we can come back.”

 — 
Dolly Parton is the latest recipient of the Bezos Courage and Civility Award.
“Jeff [Bezos] and I are so proud to share that we have a new Bezos Courage and Civility Award winner — a woman who gives with her heart and leads with love and compassion in every aspect of her work,” Bezos’ longtime partner, Lauren Sanchez, posted on Instagram alongside a video of their speech Friday before awarding the grant to the country music legend and longtime philanthropist.
“We can’t wait to see all the good that you’re going to do with this $100 million award, @DollyParton.”
Parton, who has donated to various causes for decades, publicly thanked Bezos and Sanchez on Twitter.
“I try to put my money where my heart is. I will do my best to do good things with this money,” Parton tweeted. “Thank you @JeffBezos #LaurenSanchez”
During the Covid-19 pandemic, Parton donated $1 million to Vanderbilt University Medical Center’s vaccine research efforts. It was partly used to fund Moderna’s Covid-19 vaccine.
She said in an interview at the time with BBC’s “The One Show,” that she felt “honored and proud.”
“I just felt so proud to have been part of that little seed money that will hopefully grow into something great and help to heal this world,” she said. “I’m a very proud girl today to know I had anything at all to do with something that’s going to help us through this crazy pandemic.”
In 1988, Parton established the Dollywood Foundation, and eventually The Imagination Library, a program that helps children across the world access books.
Among her philanthropic efforts in her home state of Tennessee, Parton also created the Dolly Parton Scholarship, which provides $15,000 to recipients towards a college education.
Last year, Bezos awarded $100 million each to CNN contributor Van Jones and chef José Andrés.
Bezos, the founder and former head of Amazon.com, said at a news conference at the time the grant had no strings attached.
“They can give it all to their own charity,” Bezos said last year. “Or they can share the wealth. It is up to them.”

Over 50 species previously thought to be mute make sounds, according to a new study
By Zoe Sottile, CNN
Published 11:55 AM EST, Sun November 13, 2022
Species like the big-headed Amazon River turtle shown here have been found to make sounds, including in communications with offspring.
Gabriel Jorgewich Cohen
CNN
 — 
If you listen closely, your pet turtle might just have something to say to you.
Please don't lick this psychedelic toad, National Park Service warns
A new study published in Nature Communications has identified sounds made by 53 species, many of which were previously thought to be mute. Fifty of the species were turtles, with tuataras (a kind of reptile found in New Zealand), caecilians (a limbless amphibian), and the South American lungfish rounding out the group.
Gabriel Jorgewich-Cohen, the lead researcher on the publication and a PhD student at the University of Zurich, told CNN that the idea for the research was born when he read about a project in Brazil’s Amazon rainforest. In 2014, a study found that Giant South American river turtles found in the Amazon use vocal communication to speak to each other – including calling to their offspring.
Western lowland gorilla born at Fort Worth Zoo
Hearing the mother turtles calling to their young made Jorgewich-Cohen “super interested” in identifying more turtle noises, he said. “I thought maybe there are more turtles out there making sounds.”
The biologist then began collaborating with a professor who developed specialized sound equipment for recording underwater. He started at home, recording his own pet turtles. “At first, I didn’t expect to find anything,” he said.
But contrary to his expectations, he “found a lot of sounds,” he said.
The idea soon expanded into a larger research project. “The idea was to focus on animals that are commonly, historically considered to be nonvocal,” he said. “I wanted to go deep on reporting these animals that are not known to vocalize, and try to understand this in the big picture.”
Each species was recorded for at least 24 hours. The audio recordings include clicking, chirping, hissing, and purring.
He added in tuataras after speaking with a specialist on the New Zealand reptiles who said she had heard the animals making sounds during fieldwork. The audio recordings used in the research document the tuatara’s distinctive crackly vocalizations.
The sounds made by caecilians were especially unexpected, he said. “I was very surprised to discover they do produce sounds often, and in a very funny way,” he said. The caecilian recordings sound at times like purring, and at others like a loud burp.
He was also surprised by the broad repertoire of some species: Some turtles “made many different types of sounds.” Others, although they had a more limited vocabulary, “wouldn’t stop chatting,” frequently repeating the same sounds.
Each species was recorded for at least 24 hours to document its unique sounds.
And the research may have broader implications for our understanding of biology. Historically, “the main hypothesis was that the sounds made by frogs and birds and mammals all came from different evolutionary origins,” Jorgewich-Cohen explained. This phenomenon is known as convergent evolution, when species adapt in similar ways although they have different origins.
But the extended evolutionary family tree constructed by Jorgewich-Cohen’s research team suggests that the ability to produce sounds “comes from one single origin,” he said. The paper claims that vocal communication must be as old as the last common ancestor of choanate vertebrates (vertebrates with lungs), approximately 407 million years old.
In addition to recording 53 species themselves, Jorgewich-Cohen and his team also used an acoustic communication dataset published by University of Arizona professor of ecology and evolutionary biology John Wiens and Zhuo Chen in Nature Communications in 2020.
Wiens, who was not consulted for Jorgewich-Cohen’s study, told CNN that further research is needed to establish the common origins of vocal communication.
Jorgewich-Cohen’s research just shows that the turtles and other species are making sounds – not that they are using those sounds to communicate with each other, he said. In the article, Jorgewich-Cohen and his team wrote that “the presence of a complex repertoire (presence of a number of different sounds and/or harmonic calls)” indicated “communicative meaning.”
These endangered turtles just hatched for the first time in North America
Establishing that the sounds are actually meaningful communication will require more research, Wiens said. He pointed to playback experiments, like when researchers play recordings of two different male frogs for a female frog to see which attracts her more. Experiments like those provide more meaningful evidence that the sounds are actually used for communication, according to Wiens.
And the criteria for what the scientists identified as acoustic communication weren’t clear, he said. “In some of these cases, it’s hard to tell they’re making sounds at all,” said Wiens.
Still, the article is helpful for showing that the animal world is indeed chattier than scientists thought before.
“They’ve documented more things making sounds than people had appreciated previously,” Wiens said. “That’s the first step.”
The next step should be to implement playback experiments and other tests “to figure out if they have acoustic communication or not,” he said.
Going forward, Jorgewich-Cohen says he hopes to decipher what turtles are actually saying to each other – if anything.
“In most cases, we just know they’re making sounds. We don’t know what they mean,” he said.
And “besides that, I would like to understand a bit about their cognition ability – how they think, more than actually what the sounds mean.”
What’s more, understanding the role sound plays in turtles’ lives might help contribute to conservation efforts.
“Turtles are the second most endangered group of vertebrates, behind primates,” he said. “When we think about their conservation, we never consider human noise as a source of problems, and I think maybe now we should start considering it, rethinking how we do conservation.”

The oldest living person in the US just turned 115
By Zoe Sottile, CNN
Published 3:02 AM EST, Sat November 12, 2022
Bessie Hendricks (center), the oldest living person in the US, celebrated her 115th birthday on November 7th.

 — 
Bring out the candles – 115 of them.
Bessie Hendricks, the oldest living person in the United States, has celebrated yet another turn around the sun. The Iowa supercentenarian turned 115 on November 7, according to CNN affiliate KCCI.
The world's oldest person is a French nun who enjoys chocolate and wine
Hendricks was born in 1907. Her lifetime has seen 21 presidents, two world wars, and the sinking of the Titanic.
In addition to being the oldest living person in the United States, she is also the fourth-oldest living person in the world, according to the Gerontology Research Group, which records and certifies supercentenarians (people who have lived to be older than 110).
Hendricks celebrated her 115th birthday alongside her three children at Shady Oaks Care Center, according to KCCI.
“I don’t know how you put it into words,” said her daughter, Joan Schaffer, according to KCCI. Schaffer turned 90 the day before her mother’s 115th birthday. “It’s marvelous that we still have her.”
Hendricks’ children described her as a hard-working, caring mother. Hendricks’ own mother died when she was just 13 years old, according to KCCI.
Currently, the title for oldest living person belongs to Lucile Randon, a 118-year old French nun, says the Gerontology Research Group. The oldest person ever recorded was another Frenchwoman, Jeanne Louise Calment, who lived to be over 122 years old, according to the Guinness World Records. Calment died in 1997.

My son has been asking for a dress. I finally decided to just get him dresses despite being afraid he’d get teased by other kids. Today, the boy next door asked why he was wearing a dress, I said “he wanted one” and he said “okay” then they continued to play. The kids are alright

The health benefits of a random act of kindness

CNN
 — 
Spreading kindness not only helps others feel better about themselves — it can also boost the giver’s health and happiness, according to research. It’s a win-win for all.
Putting the well-being of others before our own without expecting anything in return — or what is called being altruistic — stimulates the reward centers of the brain, studies have shown. Those feel-good chemicals flood our system, producing a sort of “helper’s high.” Volunteering, for example, has been shown to minimize stress and improve depression.
Longer life, anyone?
Being happier will help you live longer, so learn how to be happier
That’s not all: The same activity can also reduce the risk for cognitive impairment and even help us live longer. One reason for this, experts say, is because kindness contributes to our sense of community and belonging. And that, studies have found, is a key contributor to a healthy, longer life.
Lower blood pressure
Giving donations to others, or “prosocial spending,” has been shown to reduce blood pressure and improve heart health. One study asked a group of hypertensive people to spend $40 on themselves, while another group of people with high blood pressure were told to spend the money on others.
Why being an optimist is good for your heart
They found that those who spent money on others had lower blood pressure at the end of the six-week study. In fact, the benefits were as large as those from healthy diet and exercise.
Pain reduction
Giving seems to lessen our pain. A recent study found that people who said they would donate money to help orphans were less sensitive to an electric shock than those who declined to give. In addition, the more helpful people thought their donation would be, the less pain they felt.
How could this happen? The study found that regions of the brain that react to painful stimulation appear to be instantly deactivated by the experience of giving.
Happiness
In the UK, researchers found that being kind could boost happiness in as little as three days. The study assigned people to three groups: the first group had to do an act of kindness each day; the second group tried a new activity; and the third group did nothing. The groups who were kind and did novel things saw a significant boost in happiness.
Spreading kindness doesn't have to be complicated.
You’ll experience even greater joy if you’re creative with your acts of kindness. Happiness researchers Sonja Lyubomirsky and Kennon Sheldon found that people who did a variety of acts of kindness throughout the week showed greater increases in happiness than those who performed the same activity over and over again.
And here’s the good news: It seems acts of kindness can be anonymous or visible, spontaneous or planned, and can be as simple as giving a compliment or opening a door for someone.
Kindness suggestions
OK, you’re convinced and want to jump right into being a kinder and more helpful person. There are literally hundreds of ideas on the internet, but here are a few to get you started:
While driving, make room for the car that wants to enter your lane.
Give a genuine compliment to a family member, friend or colleague.
Do the same for your boss — they probably never get compliments!
Let go of a grudge and tell that person you forgive them (unless telling them makes it worse).
Be there for a friend having a tough time. Don’t try to fix it; just listen.
Leave your mail carrier a thank-you note.
Overtip your delivery person.
But I’m so tired
That’s more than fair. Many people are struggling economically and are often overcome with balancing the needs of family, work and community. Consider being kind to yourself (in whatever way that means to you) as well as others. We all need a break.
Want more ideas? The Random Acts of Kindness Foundation, which promotes kindness all year, has lists of kindness ideas, organized by work, community, environment, animals, strangers, kids, seniors and more.
“You’re making the world a better place,” the foundation says. But don’t forget — any kindness you give to others is also a gift to yourself.

Dave Chappelle talks Kanye, antisemitism and Trump in ‘SNL’ monologue

 — 
Dave Chappelle addressed several contentious topics in his latest “Saturday Night Live” monologue, focusing mostly on Kanye West’s recent antisemitic comments.
In a lengthy stand-up set, Chappelle name-checked former President Donald Trump and Senate candidate Herschel Walker – and also may have alluded to the negative reaction to jokes he’s made about transgender people.
Before he began his routine, he unfolded a small piece of paper and read from it: “‘I denounce antisemitism in all its forms. And I stand with my friends in the Jewish community.’ And that, Kanye, is how you buy yourself some time.”
Dave Chappelle hosts 'SNL' tonight. Here's a timeline of controversies surrounding his jokes about transgender people
On the topic of West, Chappelle said he typically approached the rapper when West was embroiled in a controversy – but this time, Chappelle said, he waited to observe the response to West’s antisemitic statements. Chappelle also joked that “Kanye got in so much trouble, Kyrie got in trouble,” referencing the NBA star suspended by the Brooklyn Nets for comments after sharing a link to an antisemitic movie on social media.
Chappelle said he could see how West would “adopt the delusion that the Jews run show business,” saying it’s “not a crazy thing to think – but it’s a crazy thing to say out loud in a climate like this.”
He went on: “I know the Jewish people have been through terrible things all over the world, but you can’t blame that on Black Americans. You just can’t.”
In an apparent nod to the backlash some comics receive when audiences find their jokes offensive, Chappelle ended the monologue by admitting to the audience he no longer enjoyed performing in front of large crowds, saying “it shouldn’t be this scary to talk about anything, it makes my job incredibly difficult.”
“I hope they don’t take anything away from me,” he said. “Whoever they are.”
Chappelle has made explicit jokes about trans women’s bodies and misgendered trans people in several stand-up specials released in the last few years. Criticism of his comments quickly mounted in 2021 following the release of his multi-million dollar Netflix special, “The Closer,” offending LGBTQ advocates and leading some Netflix employees to protest the company and call for the special to be removed.
Netflix stood by the special, which was later nominated for two Emmys. Chappelle addressed the criticism on tour shortly after the release of his special, telling his audience he was willing to talk with trans critics but was not “bending to anybody’s demands.”

Is the worst over for bitcoin and the rest of crypto?
Beware: The companies that hold your crypto aren’t insured the way banks are

Editor’s Note: This is an updated version of an article that first published on June 13, 2022.
The latest “crypto winter,” which sent the values of Bitcoin and other digital currencies plummeting, served as a healthy reminder that cryptocurrencies are highly risky investments.
But that risk is by no means limited to price volatility.
Traditional savings and investment accounts can never be 100% safe in the event an institution becomes insolvent, either. But most banks and brokerages, as well as 401(k) plans, do provide federally guaranteed protections and other insurance.
Lose big on crypto? Here's how to reduce the sting
Crypto custodial accounts, however, do not enjoy those same safeguards, in part because the legal, tax and regulatory frameworks – to say nothing of the legal definitions of what a specific cryptocurrency is – are still being worked out. They’re not legal tender and they’re not always viewed as securities.
What’s more, customers may unwittingly agree to let the company running an exchange or platform use their digital assets. “There are some platforms that have agreements which essentially say that ‘by depositing your crypto with us, you are granting us the authority to use, transfer, invest, do whatever we want with your crypto,’” said Florida-based bankruptcy attorney Alan Rosenberg.
And if the company goes bankrupt, then customers may be treated as unsecured creditors – meaning they may not get anything back.
So Rosenberg’s best advice is to read the legal fine print before buying, selling or storing digital assets with any company facilitating crypto trading to see what protections they do offer.
For investments and savings in which you’d like to have a greater sense of safety, here are some of the key protections offered by traditional financial accounts.
Bank and credit union accounts
If you have a checking or savings account, a money market deposit account or certificates of deposit at a bank or credit union, make sure the institution has deposit insurance.
Banks typically are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). Should your bank fail, that coverage will protect up to $250,000 per depositor for each account ownership category at an FDIC-insured bank. There are several types of deposit accounts you may have at one bank (e.g., personal account, business account, etc.) and each would be covered separately. Plus, if you own an account jointly, each owner is covered up to $250,000. (Use this FDIC calculator to figure out your coverage given the particulars of your situation.)
And if you have deposits in a self-directed retirement account at a federally insured bank, they would also receive up to $250,000 in protection.
Credit unions that are federally insured offer the same level of coverage through the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA).
Brokerage accounts
If you have an IRA or a taxable account of stocks and bonds with a registered broker-dealer that is a member of the nonprofit Securities Investor Protection Corporation, you will receive up to $500,000 of protection should that brokerage go bankrupt.
Up to half that amount can be used to protect cash in your account associated with your securities – for example, if you just sold some stocks and left the proceeds in your account with the brokerage.
On top of the SIPC insurance, a brokerage may provide additional protection to its customers through private insurers like Lloyd’s of London.
In addition, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued a Customer Protection Rule that requires registered broker-dealers to safeguard customer securities and cash, prohibiting the dealers from using any customer money to fund the firm’s overhead or activities.
401(k)s
If your employer goes belly up, legally the money in your 401(k) cannot be treated as the company’s assets by a bankruptcy court.
”[The Employee Retirement Income Security Act] protects 401(k) assets that have been deposited and are fully vested if the employer files bankruptcy,” said Hattie Greenan, spokesperson for the Plan Sponsor Council of America.

6 dead after a pair of vintage military aircraft collided at a Texas air show

CNN
 — 
Six people are dead after two World War II-era military planes collided midair and crashed at Dallas Executive Airport during an airshow Saturday afternoon, killing all on board, the Dallas County Medical Examiner’s office said Sunday.
“We can confirm that there are six (fatalities),” a spokesperson for the office told CNN in a phone call.
More than 40 fire rescue units responded to the scene after the two vintage planes – a Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress and a Bell P-63 Kingcobra – went down during the Wings Over Dallas airshow.
In video footage of the crash described by Dallas’ mayor as “heartbreaking,” the planes are seen breaking apart midair after the collision, then hitting the ground within seconds before bursting into flames.
Here are the latest developments as investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board begin their investigation:
The B-17 Flying Fortress, one of the planes that crashed at the airshow at Dallas Executive Airport on Saturday, Nov. 12, 2022, normally had a crew of 4 to 5 people.

What we know about the crew members killed
The crash took place at around 1:20 p.m. Saturday, the Federal Aviation Administration said.
The Allied Pilots Association – the labor union representing American Airlines pilots – identified two pilot retirees and former union members among those killed in the collision.
Terry Barker and Len Root were crew on the B-17 Flying Fortress during the airshow, the APA said on social media.
“Our hearts go out to their families, friends, and colleagues past and present,” the union said. The APA is offering professional counseling services at their headquarters in Fort Worth following the incident.
Terry Barker killed in the Dallas Saturday plane crash
The death of Barker was also announced by Keller Mayor Armin Mizani on Sunday morning in a Facebook post.
“Keller is grieving as we have come to learn that husband, father, Army veteran, and former Keller City Councilman Terry Barker was one of the victims of the tragic crash at the Dallas Air Show,” Mizani wrote.
“Terry Barker was beloved by many. He was a friend and someone whose guidance I often sought. Even after retiring from serving on the City Council and flying for American Airlines, his love for community was unmistakable.”
A 30-year plus veteran of the Civil Air Patrol’s Ohio Wing, Maj. Curtis J. Rowe, was also among those killed in the collision, Col. Pete Bowden, the agency’s commander, said Sunday.
Rowe served in several positions throughout his tenure with the Civil Air Patrol, from safety officer to operations officer, and most recently, he was the Ohio Wing maintenance officer, Bowden said. Rowe’s family was notified of his death Saturday evening, the commander added.
“I reach to find solace in that when great aviators like Curt perish, they do so doing what they loved. Curt touched the lives of thousands of his fellow CAP members, especially the cadets who he flew during orientation flights or taught at Flight Academies and for that, we should be forever grateful,” Bowden wrote in a Facebook post.
“To a great aviator, colleague, and Auxiliary Airman, farewell,” he said.
In a Saturday news conference, Hank Coates, president and CEO of the Commemorative Air Force, an organization which preserves and maintains vintage military aircraft, told reporters the B-17 “normally has a crew of four to five. That was what was on the aircraft,” while the P-63 is a “single-piloted fighter type aircraft.”

Three more victims were identified in a release from the Commemorative Air Force, which hosted the event.
“We are heartbroken to announce that the following members of the Commemorative Air Force went west on Saturday,” the statement said, using the phrase pilots use when one of their own has died.
Craig Hutain was a United Airlines pilot and executive officer with Tora! Tora! Tora! Airshows. In a bio on the company website, Hutain wrote he started flying with his father at 10 years old. He took his first solo flight at 17, became a flight instructor in college at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in aeronautical engineering, and got a job with an airline in 1982. He was married, with two daughters and four grandchildren.
Kevin “K5” Michels and Dan Ragan were named as the other victims. CNN is working to obtain more information about Michels and Ragan.
The Commemorative Air Force identified both aircraft as based in Houston.
No spectators or others on the ground were reported injured, although the debris field from the collision includes the Dallas Executive Airport grounds, Highway 67 and a nearby strip mall.
Rare aircraft involved
The B-17 was part of the collection of the Commemorative Air Force, nicknamed “Texas Raiders,” and had been kept in a hangar in Conroe, Texas, near Houston.
It was one of about 45 complete examples of the model, only nine of which were airworthy.
The P-63 was even rarer. Some 14 examples are known to survive, four of which in the US were airworthy, including one owned by the Commemorative Air Force.
More than 12,000 B-17s were produced by Boeing, Douglas Aircraft and Lockheed between 1936 and 1945, with nearly 5,000 lost during the war, and most of the rest scrapped by the early 1960s. About 3,300 P-63s were produced by Bell Aircraft between 1943 and 1945 and were principally used by the Soviet Air Force in World War II.
A frame from a video taken at the airshow shows smoke rising after the crash.

NTSB launches go-team
The FAA was leading the investigation Saturday, but the NTSB took over the investigation once its team reached the scene, the agency said at a news conference Sunday. The team dispatched by the NTSB consists of technical experts who are regularly sent to plane crash sites to investigate the collision, according to the NTSB.
The NTSB has received the air show common frequency recording, which is the verbal radio transmissions between pilots, and it will be processed by an investigative specialist, NTSB Member Michael Graham said in an update Monday.
Neither aircraft was equipped with a flight data recorder or cockpit voice recorder, often known as the “black box,” Graham said.
“However, we recovered this morning the electronic flight display from the B-17 and a GPS navigational unit from the P-63,” he said in an update Monday.
The units from the two aircraft were damaged during the accident, according to Graham, and are being sent to the NTSB recorder lab in Washington, D.C., to determine “whether data and relevant information can be recovered from both units.”
“The NTSB’s recorder lab specializes in recovering data from electronic devices and avionics and the data often assist in determining the probable cause,” Graham said.
Data that these types of units “may have,” according to Graham, would be things like GPS location, possible altitudes of the aircraft, and the airspeeds of the aircraft.
Investigators surveyed the accident site using both an NTSB drone and a photograph of the scene from the ground to document the area before the wreckage is moved to a secure location, Graham said earlier.
“We have recovered the wreckage of the P-63 as of this morning, and it has been transported to a secure location and it’ll be laid out for examination and analysis,” Graham said. “Rain has delayed further recovery of the B-17. The recovery process will continue tomorrow, weather permitting.”
Graham asked anyone with photos or videos of the incident to share them with the NTSB.
“They’ll be very critical to analyze the collision and also tie that in with the aircraft control recordings to determine why the two aircraft collided and to determine, basically, the how and why this accident happened and then eventually, hopefully, maybe make some safety recommendations to prevent it from happening in the future,” he said.
According to Coates, the individuals flying the aircraft in his group’s airshows are volunteers and follow a strict training process. Many of them are airline pilots, retired airline pilots or retired military pilots.
“The maneuvers that they (the aircraft) were going through were not dynamic at all,” Coates noted. “It was what we call ‘Bombers on Parade.”
“This is not about the aircraft. It’s just not,” Coates said. “I can tell you the aircraft are great aircraft. They’re safe. They’re very well-maintained. The pilots are very well-trained. So it’s difficult for me to talk about it because I know all these people. These are family, and they’re good friends.”
While neither aircraft did not have a flight data recorder or a cockpit voice recorder, and “nor are they required to,” Graham said the NTSB would be looking “down the road” at whether it is something that needs to be recommended.
“We also must remember these are very vintage, old 1940’s aircraft. So that’d be something that we’ll look at as a possible recommendation down the road, but I have nothing further on that to say if that is what it would be,” he added.
A preliminary accident report is expected in four to six weeks, but a full report on the investigation may not arrive for 12 to 18 months.
The Wings Over Dallas event, which was scheduled to run through Sunday, was canceled, according to the organizer’s website.
CNN’s Raja Razek, Chris Boyette, Eliott C. McLaughlin, Pete Muntean, Rebekah Riess, Michelle Watson and Keith Allen contributed to this report.

Joan Didion's personal belongings are being sold in one of the most coveted estate sales of the year
Updated 13th November 2022
Credit: Stair Galleries
Written by
Jeanne Bonner, CNN
On a visit once to her family's home in the corner of California where she grew up, Joan Didion opened a drawer crammed full of her old things and took an inventory.
Booklovers and style mavens are agog over personal items up for auction that once belonged to the seminal essayist Joan Didion Credit: Stair Galleries
""A bathing suit I wore the summer I was seventeen,"" she wrote in her essay, ""On Going Home."" ""A letter of rejection from The Nation ... Three teacups hand-painted with cabbage roses and signed 'E.M.,' my grandmother's initials.""
She felt moved to take stock because during the visit she had been ""paralyzed"" by meeting her past ""at every turn, around every corner, inside every cupboard.""
Literary fans have shown enormous interest in the personal items of Joan Didion available at auction Credit: Stair Galleries
Now the past (in the form of furniture, artwork and books) of this legendary writer and style icon, who died last year at age 87, is going up for auction, and the stir the estate sale has created could not be bigger.
""We have not had this kind of interest before,"" said Lisa Thomas, director of the Fine Arts Department at Stair Galleries in Hudson, New York, which is handling the auction. ""She was an icon in several different arenas; a literary personality, a documentarian of American culture at significant points in our history and a personal style icon. I think that's why her reach is so big.""

Fans of the author who penned such seminal essay collections as ""Slouching Towards Bethlehem"" (which includes ""On Going Home"") and ""The White Album"" can bid on the oak library table where she wrote, her silver candelabras and her collection of Hemingway hardbacks, not to mention a rattan chair where she often sat when photographers came to take her portrait.
The live auction will take place on Nov. 16 but online bidding has begun, and Thomas says not a single lot has failed to attract bids -- even when it consists of blank writing notebooks Didion didn't get around to using or books available at most bookstores. One lot of 13 journals had reached $2,500 in bidding at press time.
Many of the artworks Didion owned were personal gifts to her from the artists Credit: Stair Galleries
""The blank notebooks have taken on a life of their own,"" Thomas said.
And like the many books on the block that Didion owned, the notebooks will go home to the winning bidder with a bookplate stating they are from ""The Library of Joan Didion.""
Stair Galleries has held auctions of personal items belonging to such notables as Rolling Stone guitarist Keith Richards and artist Helen Frankenthaler, not to mention Park Avenue socialites. But Thomas said there is significantly more enthusiasm for the Didion belongings, which belies economics.
""The intrinsic value is not huge but what we're seeing already with bidding online, things are way outbidding what their innate value is,"" Thomas said. ""People want an object that came from her home, that she touched and used and that represents her.""
Among the items likely to sell for the highest price are artworks by Richard Diebenkorn and Edward Ruscha, which at press time had already reached $28,000 and $11,000 in pre-auction bidding. There are also photos by Patti Smith and Annie Liebovitz, as well as an iconic portrait of Didion posing in front of her Corvette Stingray.
Record-breaking sale of Microsoft co-founder's art collection surpasses $1.6 billion
Didion, who was born in 1934, wrote essays, fiction and movie scripts. She was the rare woman included in the pack of writers known under the moniker the New Journalism, a movement that included Norman Mailer, Tom Wolfe and Hunter S. Thompson, and which was characterized by bold, immersive, personal writing combined with nonfiction reporting.
Didion was not only a revered writer but was also considered a style icon whose signature sunglasses were much-copied Credit: Stair Galleries
The hubbub created by the auction may reflect Didion's ties to both coasts, which emerged in her writing. A native Californian who attended Berkeley, she wrote memorably and presciently about her home state. Her 1970 novel, ""Play It As It Lays,"" features a Hollywood actress grappling with the ennui of modern life against a backdrop of the arid, unforgiving Mojave Desert. She also famously wrote about hippies in San Francisco's Haight-Ashbury, and the Santa Ana winds.
""Didion never forgot she was a Westerner,"" wrote Tracy Daugherty, in his 2015 biography of Didion, ""The Last Love Song."" ""In the Sacramento Valley of her childhood, rattlesnakes were common. They were part and parcel of the paradise her ancestors yearned for.""
Among the items on the auction block is a 19th century desk built in California that Didion's parents had owned Credit: Stair Galleries
Yet Didion also lived for many years in New York with her husband, John Gregory Dunne and daughter, Quintana Roo, and was embraced by a sophisticated, fashion city that saw her clothes and her signature sunglasses as connoting an inimitable style. Indeed, the items up for sale at the auction come from the New York apartment where she spent her final years.
In an essay about her time in Manhattan called ""Goodbye to All That,"" she wrote, ""Now when New York comes back to me it comes in hallucinatory flashes,"" adding she wore two perfumes when she lived in New York and now ""the slightest trace of either can short-circuit my connections for the rest of the day.""
Groups of books from Didion's home comprise multiple auction lots. They will be fitted with bookplates saying, ""From The Library of Joan Didion"" Credit: Stair Galleries
Those geographic bonds make her particularly attractive to the legions of writers and readers in both places.
""I always keep her books on the shelf, within reach,"" Tess Taylor, a poet, critic and native Californian, told CNN.
Taylor, who wrote about Didion for CNN Opinion last year after her death, said certain public figures have a kind of ""charisma"" that people want to be close to them -- and to their belongings.
""We feel this way about artists,"" Taylor said in an interview. ""Whatever they hold and touch is kind of sacred.""
'Calendar Girls' shows senior women like you've never seen them (but probably should)
Taylor said her personal belongings -- including auction lots of period cookbooks and her favorite novels -- provide ""windows into a mindset, into a time."" And they represent a woman many aspiring writers idolized, absorbing her words as instructions, and the photographic portraits as models for being. As Didion said during a talk entitled ""Why I Write,"" she defined herself not as ""a 'good' writer or a 'bad' writer but simply a writer, a person whose most absorbed and passionate hours are spent arranging words on pieces of paper.""
Didion's blank notebooks have garnered great interest among bidders, especially from writers who seek ""the promise of the blank page,"" Lisa Thomas with Stair Galleries said Credit: Stair Galleries
She was the subject of a 2017 documentary called ""The Center Will Not Hold,"" directed by her nephew, the actor Griffin Dunne, whose father, author and TV personality Dominick Dunne, was Didion's brother-in-law.
Long before succumbing to Parkinson's last December, Didion had witnessed the harrowing death of her husband as well as her daughter, and her memoirs on grief, including ""The Year of Magical Thinking,"" became bibles for the bereaved.
In that essay about sifting through old things at her family's California homestead that helped launch her glittering literary career, Didion eventually shuts the drawer.
""There is no ... solution for letters of rejection from The Nation and teacups hand-painted in 1900,"" Didion wrote in ""On Going Home.""
But there will be a solution for the IBM electric typewriter she'd kept on filing cabinets in her home office in New York -- some lucky literary fan will soon have it, embodying one of many ways that Joan Didion and her aura will live on.

 — 
Looks like Thanksgiving will be a lot pricier this year.
Market research firm IRI predicts that your Thanksgiving meal will cost about 13.5% more compared to last year, based on how retail prices in the four weeks through October 16 compared to the same period in 2021. IRI measures items including turkey and other meat, baking essentials, beverages and popular side dishes in its list of Thanksgiving foods.
Even if retailers offer promotions in the weeks or days leading up to the holiday, those prices will still likely be higher than in the same period a year ago, said Alastair Steel, executive of IRI Client Engagement.
“Promotions could swing the number a little, but I don’t expect [them] to swing it in a meaningful way,” he told CNN Business. “If anything, there are slightly less promotions,” this year, he added, because manufactures have been increasing prices as their own costs rise.

It’s no surprise that Thanksgiving is expected to be more expensive this year given how high grocery prices have been in general. Extreme weather conditions such as drought and diseases, including the highly contagious avian flu, among other factors, have contributed to stubbornly high food inflation. In the year through September, not adjusted for seasonal shifts, grocery prices shot up 13%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Shoppers know what’s coming. About 38% of consumers are expecting to pay more for Thanksgiving meals this year, even though they’re planning to buy the same amount of food, according to an IRI survey conducted in September.
There could still be some relief in the grocery aisle, however. Discount retailers like Aldi and Lidl have promised low prices on some Thanksgiving favorites this year.
Aldi said it would lower some prices to 2019 levels, and Lidl said that its typical Thanksgiving basket, including frozen turkey, fresh cranberries, sweet potatoes and more, will cost under $30 and feed 10 people, while supplies last. Discount retailers have picked up new customers as inflation has risen.

 — 
Tom Brady has become well-accustomed at making history over his long and illustrious NFL career. And on Sunday, the 45-year-old set more historic marks from all the way across the globe.
Brady’s Tampa Bay Buccaneers beat the Seattle Seahawks 21-16 at the Allianz Arena in Germany, the NFL’s first regular season game in the country.
With the victory, Brady became the first quarterback to win an NFL game in three different countries outside of the US.
As a New England Patriot, Brady won all three of the international games he played in, with two in London and one in Mexico City.
And now, he can add Germany to the list as the NFL’s most decorated player adds another accolade to his ever-expanding collection.
After the victory, Brady described the atmosphere in the Allianz Arena – the home of German football giants, Bayern Munich – as “pretty electric.”

“It was a great atmosphere,” he told the NFL Network. “It felt like a pretty hyped up game when we came out for warm-ups.
“It was pretty electric so I hope the German fans got what they wanted. Great win by our team, we needed it. Played against a great opponent, our defense played great and I’m glad we found a way to slug it out and win.”
Despite a tough season prior to Sunday, Brady looked much more like himself, throwing a 31-yard touchdown pass to Julio Jones and with Leonard Fournette running for another as the Buccaneers raced into a 14-0 second lead.
With the Bucs up 14-3 in the third quarter, the team attempted to pull out all the stops as Fournette attempted to throw to Brady though Brady slipped and Fournette was intercepted by Tariq Woolen.
And when Chris Godwin caught a four-yard touchdown pass from Brady early in the fourth quarter, the result looked wrapped up with the score at 21-3.
However, a late comeback from the Seahawks meant the German fans went home with their fair share of excitement.
Tyler Lockett’s touchdown with just over eight minutes narrowed the gap and Brady’s untimely interception to Cody Barton was capitalized on by Seattle as Marquise Goodwin caught a touchdown pass from Seattle quarterback Geno Smith to reduce the deficit to just five with under four minutes to play.
Smith finished the afternoon with 275 passing yards and two touchdown passes.

But, just when they needed it, Tampa Bay produced a time-killing drive to kill the game off behind the running ability of Rachaad White – who ran for a career-high 105 yards – and secure the team’s fifth victory of the season and second in a row.
The Bucs now head into their bye week atop the NFC South and looking much more like the team that was predicted to vie for a Super Bowl ring.
For the Seahawks, after a promising start to the season, they fall to 6-4, but head back to the West coast of the US with their heads held high after showing resolve late on.
New York Jets QB Mike White celebrates after beating the Chicago Bears 31-10 at MetLife Stadium on November 27. White had a monster afternoon, throwing for 315 yards and three touchdowns.

Henry Winkler explains the trick that allowed him to transform into The Fonz
By Marianne Garvey, CNN
Published 9:17 AM EST, Sun November 13, 2022
Video Ad Feedback
'Happy Days' star calls himself a fool for turning down iconic role
01:06 - Source: CNN
CNN
 — 
Henry Winkler credits landing the role of Arthur “The Fonz” Fonzarelli to an accent he made up on the spot during his “Happy Days” audition.
Winkler spoke with CNN’s Chris Wallace about his long career in Hollywood and revealed that as a Jewish kid from Manhattan, he was surprised he was cast at age 27 as The Fonz, the unflappable, cool rider in the Milwaukee-set “Happy Days” sitcom.
Wallace asked Winkler how he transformed into the “epitome of cool” in a new episode of “Who’s Talking to Chris Wallace?”
“Because I trained for many, many years to be an actor, and I got to play somebody. I wasn’t somebody who I wanted to be,” Winkler replied, adding, “And it was so much fun. They are still my family. All of the people who have survived are still very, very close. We are incredibly friendly.”
Winkler said producers originally envisioned The Fonz as “a taller Italian kid.”
“And they got you know, this short Jew from New York, but all I did Chris, all I did was change my voice,” Winkler recalled. “I introduce myself as Henry, and then as I started to do it, something overtook me … And I changed my voice like this and it unleashed me.”
Winkler said he just went with it, and in doing so became braver in acting while in real life he said he still felt like “a bowl of jello that had not congealed yet.”
Noting that TV Guide ranked The Fonz as number four out of 50 greatest characters in the history of television so far, Winkler called the recognition “insane” to him.
New episodes of “Who’s Talking to Chris Wallace?” debut Fridays on HBO Max and Sundays on CNN at 7 p.m. ET.

Israeli President invites Netanyahu to form government
By Elliott Gotkine, Michael Schwartz and Idris Muktar Ibrahim, CNN
Published 8:57 AM EST, Sun November 13, 2022

CNN
 — 
Israel’s President Isaac Herzog asked Benjamin Netanyahu to form a new government on Sunday, allowing the former prime minister to secure the country’s top job for a record sixth time and extend his record as the nation’s longest-serving leader.
Netanyahu, who served 12 years as Prime Minister before losing office in 2021, was recommended by party leaders representing more than half of Israel’s 120 parliament or Knesset members after the president concluded a political consultation with them.
“Israel’s citizens require a stable and functioning government,” he said in remarks after the closed-door meeting with Netanyahu. “A government that serves all citizens of Israel, both those who supported and voted for it and those who opposed its establishment; a government that works on behalf of and for the sake of all shades of the Israeli mosaic, from all communities, sectors, faiths, religions, lifestyles, beliefs, and values, and that treats them all with sensitivity and responsibility.”
“Please God, it will be a stable, successful, and responsible government of all of the people of Israel,” said Netanyahu, speaking alongside Herzog. “We are brothers and we will live together side by side.”
Israelis voted on November 1 for a fifth time in four years to break the political stalemate in the country.
Netanyahu’s Likud party has the most seats in the Knesset, and the former prime minister will have 28 days to form a coalition government, with the possibility of a two-week extension.
How a rule change helped Netanyahu win Israel's elections
But Netanyahu isn’t in for an easy ride: he is now likely to lead an ever-polarized country and possibly one of the most right-wing governments in Israel’s history.
During negotiations, he will have to divide up ministries among his coalition partners and haggle over policies.
This is where things get interesting. The five factions allied with Netanyahu’s Likud have a four-seat majority in the 120-seat Knesset, or parliament, and failure to give any one of them what they want could provoke them to bring the coalition down.
When it comes to the ultra-Orthodox parties, their demands are uncontroversial as far as Netanyahu is concerned: bigger budgets for religious schools, and the right not to teach their children secular subjects such as math and English.
The real showdowns are likely to come with his new extreme right-wing allies. Netanyahu rode to power on the back of a stunning showing by the Religious Zionism/Jewish Power list, which, with 14 seats, is now the third-biggest grouping in the Knesset. Its leader, Itamar Ben Gvir, who has a conviction for inciting anti-Arab racism and supporting terrorism, has demanded to be made Public Security Minister, in charge of Israel’s police.
Ben Gvir’s partner is Bezalel Smotrich, who has described himself as a “proud homophobe.” He has said Israel should be run according to Jewish law. He has spoken of reducing the power of the Supreme Court, and striking out the crime of breach of trust – which just so happens to be part of the indictments against Netanyahu in his ongoing corruption trials. Netanyahu has long denied all of the charges. If Smotrich wins the Justice Ministry he covets, he may be able to make these things happen, ending Netanyahu’s legal worries.
Yet these may be the least of his concerns. Having joined forces with the extreme right wing, the sixth reign of Netanyahu may end up further alienating the half of Israel that didn’t vote for the bloc of parties backing him.
Assuming Netanyahu can reach a coalition agreement by the December 11 deadline, the Knesset Speaker will call a confidence vote within seven days. If all goes to plan, his government will then take office.

 — 
FTX Group said Friday it has filed for bankruptcy in the United States and that its CEO has resigned, marking a stunning downfall for one of the biggest and most powerful players in the crypto industry.
FTX said Sam Bankman-Fried, the 30-year-old founder of the exchange, will remain to assist in an orderly transition. Taking the helm in his place is John J. Ray III, the lawyer who oversaw the liquidation of Enron.
Several employees are expected to stay on to run the company in Chapter 11.
“I’m really sorry, again, that we ended up here,” Bankman-Fried wrote in a Twitter thread Friday. “Hopefully things can find a way to recover.”
The bankruptcy proceedings include FTX US, FTX’s crypto hedge fund Alameda and about 130 other sister companies.
Crypto is in chaos as FTX files for bankruptcy
Ray said bankruptcy protection will give FTX the chance to “assess its situation and develop a process to maximize recoveries for stakeholders.”
In its bankruptcy filing, FTX says it has between $10 billion and $50 billion of estimated liabilities and assets.
The bankruptcy serves two immediate functions, says Eric Snyder, a bankruptcy attorney with Wilk Auslander. It stops any further withdrawals from the exchange and creates a central place to examine all the claims.
“One of the unknowns is where they’re going to get the funds to operate bankruptcy,” he said. “We don’t have an answer to that right now.”
The implosion of FTX, unthinkable just days ago, is shaking the crypto industry to its core. It was triggered by a run-on-the-bank-like crisis after serious questions were raised last week about the health of the FTX balance sheet.
Regulators are now swirling to investigate what went wrong, and some lawmakers are demanding a crackdown.
Securities regulators in the Bahamas, where FTX.com is based, froze some of the embattled exchange’s assets on Thursday. FTX’s Japanese business was put into “close-only mode,” meaning users can only close out their positions, after regulators in that country ordered it to suspend operations.
Both the Justice Department and Securities and Exchange Commission are investigating FTX, The Wall Street Journal reported. The DOJ declined to comment, and the SEC said it does not comment on the existence or nonexistence of investigations.
Bankman-Fried has been one of the faces of the crypto industry, amassing a fortune once totaling $25 billion that has since vanished. He was viewed as the crypto world’s white knight, stepping in to rescue struggling companies. FTX, backed by elite investors like BlackRock and Sequoia Capital, rapidly became one of the biggest crypto exchanges in the world.
FTX spent lavishly to reach endorsement deals with the likes of Gisele, Tom Brady and Steph Curry. The company’s logo and name are splashed on the home of the NBA’s Miami Heat and even on the logos of MLB umpires.
The implosion of FTX was preceded by the decision to lend billions of dollars’ worth of customer assets to fund risky bets by Alameda, the Journal reported on Thursday. Alameda now owes FTX a staggering $10 billion that the exchange had serious trouble raising, the paper said.
It’s not clear what comes next for Bankman-Fried, who has hired Paul Weiss attorney Martin Flumenbaum, a white-collar defense lawyer known for representing junk-bond trader Michael Milken.
“FTX’s bankruptcy underscores crypto’s structural challenges around transparency and poor risk management that, time and again, have led to losses for investors,” said Monsur Hussain, senior director at Fitch Ratings.

‘Power Slap’: UFC president launches new open-handed striking venture
By Ben Morse, CNN
Published 6:43 AM EST, Sat November 12, 2022

 — 
UFC president Dana White is getting into the slap game.
The longtime president of the UFC announced a new striking competition called Power Slap during a press conference on Friday.
The new venture will pit men and women competitors from around the world to showcase “power, technique and resolve.”
The sport features two opponents facing each other exchanging open-handed hits to the face one after another until one wins the match.
Alongside the new series, which is set to launch in early 2023, White announced a deal with TBS for an eight-part television series. Friday’s press release states competitors will vie to earn a place in “the cast house” and Power Slap rankings.
“The sport of slap fighting is about to go to a whole new level,” White said at the Power Slap press conference at Radio City Music Hall.
“The production level will be through the roof … everything about this thing is going to the next level.”
White is collaborating with former UFC CEO Lorenzo Fertitta and television producer Craig Piligian.
White added the series has been sanctioned by the Nevada State Athletic Commission (NSAC) – the first slap league to do so – with defined rules, rankings, weight classes and “extensive medical testing.”
“I’ve been working on this since 2017. I saw some footage of slap fighting on social media and I was instantly hooked. From the first day I saw it, I felt like this could be big. I knew what needed to be done to make it a real sport just like we did with MMA,” said White.
Last month, White put out an all-call via social media telling fans: “If you have ever professionally slapped, or think you can, email a video to our casting team.”
A coin toss will determine the option of whether or not the winner would like to slap or defend first. There will be a 30 second clock to deliver the slap, and another 30 seconds for recovery. The minimum number of rounds for each competition will be three.
Victory will be determined via knockout, TKO, or by points. Like boxing and MMA, Power Slap judging is based on a “10-point must system,” with a round winner scoring 10 points and the opponent scoring 9 or fewer.
According to the Power Slap website: “judging criteria is based on the striker’s effectiveness, as well as the defender’s reaction and recovery time.”
Striker fouls include “clubbing, stepping, illegal wind-up and delay of game.” Defender fouls include “flinching, blocking and delay of game.”
Warnings, point deduction, loss of strike, re-strike and disqualification can be adjudged if fouls are assessed.

NFL Week 10 preview: Tom Brady, Tampa Bay Buccaneers face Seattle Seahawks in Germany

Week 10 features the first-ever regular season game played in Germany. The Tampa Bay Buccaneers (4-5) will face the Seattle Seahawks (6-3) in front of nearly 75,000 spectators at Allianz Arena in Munich.
The meeting makes history on multiple fronts. It marks the first time two division leaders face off internationally and the first non-soccer event ever played at the home of Bayern Munich.
With a start on Sunday, Buccaneers quarterback Tom Brady will become the first quarterback to start a game in three different countries (outside of the US). As a New England Patriot, Brady won all three of the international games he played in, with two in London and one in Mexico City.
Entering Week 10, the Buccaneers were tied at the top of the NFC South. On Thursday, the Atlanta Falcons were upset by the Carolina Panthers, handing the Bucs sole possession of first in the division.

However, they will need a win over Seattle to keep it. A win for Seattle would further solidify their position at the top of the NFC West and put them another step closer to postseason action.
Both teams’ quarterbacks have surprised football fans as of late, but for different reasons.
At 45-years-old, Brady has struggled to lead his team to success through the first half of the season. Through ten weeks, he is posting the worst touchdown percentage and passing touchdowns per game of his career, and his second-worst passing yards per attempt mark.
Now, these numbers don’t just reflect Brady’s performance, but also that of the receiving core and team as a whole. But the short story is that this has been Brady’s worst-ever start to a season.
Seattle’s Geno Smith, on the other hand, has surprised in a positive way. He leads the league in completion percentage and has the third-best passer rating (107.2 compared to Brady’s 90.5).
He’s led the Seahawks to a 6-3 record including impressive wins over the New York Giants and the Arizona Cardinals. Smith’s revival is a welcome shake up for Seahawk fans, especially considering the year former quarterback Russell Wilson is having in Denver.

The matchup comes at a crucial point for both teams. Midway through the season and at the top of their divisions, each team is vying for optimal postseason positioning.
The Bucs just snapped a three-game losing streak with a win over the Los Angeles Rams, so a second-straight win could signify the team is back on track. The Seahawks have the opportunity to prove they’re the real deal and deserve their spot in the postseason.
To watch how it all unfolds, tune in on Sunday at 9:30 a.m. ET.
Vikings at Bills
The Minnesota Vikings (7-1) travel to Buffalo to take on the Bills (6-2) on Sunday night.
Entering the matchup, the Vikings are second in the NFC and boast the league’s second-longest winning streak. The Bills are first in the AFC, but to Minnesota’s benefit, they could potentially have to play without their star quarterback, Josh Allen.
Allen suffered a right elbow injury during the Bills’ Week 9 loss to the Jets. Heading into this weekend, he was listed as questionable. He missed practice Thursday and had a limited showing on Friday. As of Saturday evening, Allen is expected to take the field on Sunday, despite the risk of further injury.

If the Bills choose not to give the signal caller another week’s rest, they run the risk of potentially setting him back further down the line. In the case of Allen’s absence, backup quarterback Case Keenum would make his first start with the Bills.
The matchup also features two of the league’s top receivers: Vikings’ Justin Jefferson and Bills’ Stefon Diggs. Jefferson leads the league in receiving yards and ranks fifth in receptions while former Vikings receiver Diggs ranks second in receptions and fourth in receiving yards.
To see these teams in action, tune in on Sunday at 1:00 p.m. ET.
Family ties
Family loyalties could be tested on Sunday.
In an interesting twist, multiple members of the same families will compete against each other in four different Week 10 matchups.
Brothers Dalvin and James Cook will face off for the first time in Buffalo, Amon’Ra and Equanimeous St. Brown will meet in Chicago, Joey and Nick Bosa will battle in San Francisco, and cousins Nick and Bradley Chubb square off in Miami.

Banksy unveils mural in Ukrainian town liberated from Russians

 — 
Renowned street artist Banksy has unveiled his latest artwork in an Instagram post – a mural in the liberated Ukrainian town of Borodianka.
The artwork shows a female gymnast balancing on a pile of rubble on the side of a building damaged by Russian strikes.
The graffiti artist posted three images of the piece Friday on social media, with a simple caption reading “Borodyanka, Ukraine,” using an alternative spelling for the town’s name.
Speculation had been mounting that Banksy was in the war-torn country after a series of murals appeared in Borodianka, located about 35 miles northwest of the capital, Kyiv.
Borodianka was hit particularly hard by Russian airstrikes in the first few weeks of the conflict.

One artwork, not officially claimed by the artist, depicted a man being flipped during a judo match with a little boy.
Another showed two children using a metal tank trap as a seesaw.
Borodianka was hit particularly hard by Russian airstrikes at the start of the invasion of Ukraine in February, with many buildings reduced to piles of rubble by long-range attacks.
It was home to 13,000 people before the war, but most fled after Russia’s invasion. What was left of Borodianka, after intense shelling and devastating strikes, was then occupied by Russian forces, who moved in on February 28.
A mural not officially claimed by Banksy shows a man being flipped during a judo match with a boy.

The town came back into Ukrainian control on April 1, and returning residents found their houses ransacked and shops pillaged with windows broken and contents stolen.
The letter “V” – a symbol used by Russia’s Eastern Military district in concert with the letter “Z,” an emblem for Moscow’s so-called “special military operation” – was found painted on buildings, vehicles and checkpoints.
The town has since been the focus of reconstruction efforts, with several tower blocks demolished as a result of damage caused by the fighting.

Suspect in custody in Istanbul blast that killed 6 and injured 81, officials say

 — 
A suspect is in custody related to an explosion that killed at least six people and injured at least 81 others in Istanbul on Sunday, Turkey’s interior ministry said early Monday.
The incident has been deemed a terrorist attack, Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay said Sunday, according to state news agency Anadolu.
“We consider it to be a terrorist act as a result of an attacker, whom we consider to be a woman, detonating the bomb,” Oktay told reporters Sunday.
Turkish officials believe Kurdish separatists from the Kurdistan Worker’s Party (PKK) and the Democratic Union Party (PYD) were most likely behind the deadly suspected bomb attack, the country’s interior minister, Suleyman Soylu, told reporters Monday.
“It is PKK/PYD terrorist organization according to our preliminary findings,” Soylu said in a press conference at the scene of Sunday’s attack on Istiklal Avenue, Istanbul.
Soylu did not elaborate or provide details of how investigators had reached this conclusion.
“A little while ago the person who left the bomb (was) taken under custody by teams of Istanbul Police Department. Before their arrest 21 more people were also taken under custody,” the minister said. “The face of terrorism is bitter, but we will continue this struggle to the end, whatever the cost is.”
CCTV footage shows a woman sitting on a bench for more than 40 minutes and then getting up one or two minutes before the explosion, leaving a bag or plastic bag behind, according to Turkish Justice Minister Bekir Bozdag.
Bozdag, who made the comments in an interview with privately owned A Haber news channel, said Turkish security forces believe the woman is the suspect, and officials are investigating her.
“There are two possibilities. Either that bag or plastic bag has a mechanism in it, it explodes on its own or someone detonates it from afar. All of these are currently under investigation.” he added.
“The name of the woman is unknown,” he said. “All the recordings and data about the woman are being analyzed.”

The blast happened on Istiklal Street in Beyoglu Square, in the heart of Turkey’s largest city, Istanbul Governor Ali Yerlikaya said.
“We wish God’s mercy on those who lost their lives and a speedy recovery to the injured,” Yerlikaya tweeted.

The six people killed include Yusuf Meydan, a member of Turkey’s Ministry of Family and Social Services, and his daughter Ecrin, according to Derya Yanık, the minister of the agency.
Soylu, the interior minister, said Monday that 50 of the 81 people injured have been discharged from the hospital, with 31 people still being treated.
Turkey’s conflict with Kurdish separatist groups has spanned four decades and claimed tens of thousands of lives. The PKK has been designated a terrorist organization by Turkey, the United States and the European Union.
“In particular, the insincerity of our so-called allies who seem friendly to us, who either hide terrorists in their own country, or feeds terrorists in the areas they occupy and send them money from their own senates, is obvious,” Soylu said.
“We will give them a response in the near future, to those who caused us this pain in Beyoglu Istiklal Street so they experience more and more pain,” Soylu said.
‘What looked like the aftermath of a war zone’
Witness Tariq Keblaoui said he was shopping on Istiklal Street when the explosion happened about 10 meters (32.8 feet) ahead of him.
“People were scattering immediately,” said Keblaoui, a Lebanese-based journalist who was on his last day of vacation in the city.
Turkish police and explosives experts work the scene of the explosion Sunday.

“Very shortly after, I could see how many injured were on the ground,” Keblaoui told CNN. He says he saw dead bodies and victims who were seriously injured.
“There was a man in the store bleeding from his ears and his legs, and his friends were crying near him,” Keblaoui said.
Police officers secure the area after the explosion.

Istiklal Street was packed with visitors when the blast happened Sunday afternoon, he said.
“It went very quickly from a very peaceful Sunday with a very crowded street full of tourists to being what looked like the aftermath of a war zone,” Keblaoui said.
Countries unite in condemning the attack
News of the explosion led to a torrent of condolences from around the world.
French President Emmanuel Macron, whose own country suffered a deadly terror attack exactly seven years earlier, shared his sympathies for the Turkish people.
2015 Paris terror attacks killed 130 people
“On this day so symbolic for our Nation, while we think of the victims who fell on November 13, 2015, the Turkish people are struck by an attack in their heart, Istanbul,” Macron tweeted Sunday. “To the Turks: we share your pain. We stand with you in the fight against terrorism.”
European Council President Charles Michel shared his condolences after Sunday’s deadly blast.

“Horrific news from Istanbul tonight,” he said. “All our thoughts are with those currently responding and the people of Türkiye at this very distressing time.”
NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg tweeted his “deepest condolences” to the Turkish people, adding that NATO “stands in solidarity with our ally” Turkey.

The United States “strongly condemns the act of violence that took place today in Istanbul,” White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Sunday. “Our thoughts are with those who were injured and our deepest condolences go to those who lost loved ones.”
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky tweeted of his “deep sadness” at the news of the blast. “I offer my condolences to the families of those who lost their lives and wish a speedy recovery to the injured,” Zelensky said. “The pain of the friendly Turkish people is our pain.”

Tesla drivers will be able to make Zoom calls from their car

 — 
Tesla drivers will soon be able to take a video call directly from their vehicle’s touchscreen dashboard, Zoom announced Tuesday.
The video call provider announced on Tuesday during its annual Zoom (ZM)topia conference, where it typically teases new features to support remote calls, that its software is coming to Tesla (TSLA)’s built-in infotainment center. In a pre-recorded demo video shown at the event, a Tesla (TSLA) driver is seen taking a Zoom (ZM) call while recharging her vehicle.
After this story initially published, the company told CNN Business the car will need to be parked show video; when the vehicle is in motion, only audio will be enabled. The timing of the launch is still unknown, however.
The feature itself is one that Tesla has been mulling for years. In May 2020, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said in a tweet adding Zoom calls to Tesla vehicles was “definitely a future feature.” In the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic, Musk received a bevvy of tweets that requested Zoom integration; drivers argued it would give them another private space to take calls and make use of the existing driver-facing camera, present in some Teslas, and large display.
At the time, a Zoom spokesperson told pop culture website Mashable that adding support for video calls into its infotainment system would not be the safest use case because many people might attempt to use it while driving.
Zoom also unveiled at Tuesday’s event other new tools, including the integration of email and calendar services directly into the service, a conversational AI and chatbot that helps troubleshoot issues, and support for developers to monetize their apps on Zoom’s App Marketplace.
The Zoom news comes as Tesla faces growing competition in the electric vehicle market from established automakers such as Volkswagen, Ford and General Motors. Some investors have expressed concerns that Musk will be too distracted by his purchase of Twitter to give enough attention to addressing Tesla’s problems.
This week, Musk continued to sell Tesla stock for a total that now nears $4 billion since he acquired Twitter (TWTR). Tesla shares have lost 46% of their value so far this year on disappointing sales caused by supply chain problems.
Musk’s companies haven’t always had a strong relationship with Zoom. SpaceX, for example, banned its employees from using Zoom in April 2020 over “significant privacy and security concerns.”

 — 
Dolly Parton is the latest recipient of the Bezos Courage and Civility Award.
“Jeff [Bezos] and I are so proud to share that we have a new Bezos Courage and Civility Award winner — a woman who gives with her heart and leads with love and compassion in every aspect of her work,” Bezos’ longtime partner, Lauren Sanchez, posted on Instagram alongside a video of their speech Friday before awarding the grant to the country music legend and longtime philanthropist.
“We can’t wait to see all the good that you’re going to do with this $100 million award, @DollyParton.”
Parton, who has donated to various causes for decades, publicly thanked Bezos and Sanchez on Twitter.
“I try to put my money where my heart is. I will do my best to do good things with this money,” Parton tweeted. “Thank you @JeffBezos #LaurenSanchez”
During the Covid-19 pandemic, Parton donated $1 million to Vanderbilt University Medical Center’s vaccine research efforts. It was partly used to fund Moderna’s Covid-19 vaccine.
She said in an interview at the time with BBC’s “The One Show,” that she felt “honored and proud.”
“I just felt so proud to have been part of that little seed money that will hopefully grow into something great and help to heal this world,” she said. “I’m a very proud girl today to know I had anything at all to do with something that’s going to help us through this crazy pandemic.”
In 1988, Parton established the Dollywood Foundation, and eventually The Imagination Library, a program that helps children across the world access books.
Among her philanthropic efforts in her home state of Tennessee, Parton also created the Dolly Parton Scholarship, which provides $15,000 to recipients towards a college education.
Last year, Bezos awarded $100 million each to CNN contributor Van Jones and chef José Andrés.
Bezos, the founder and former head of Amazon.com, said at a news conference at the time the grant had no strings attached.
“They can give it all to their own charity,” Bezos said last year. “Or they can share the wealth. It is up to them.”

All eyes on the consumer ahead of Black Friday and the holidays

CNN Business
 — 
It has been a tough year for American consumers. Inflation everywhere. Rapidly rising interest rates. A housing market that is starting to cool off. That begs a question with the holidays right around the corner: Are shoppers finally tapped out?
We’ll get a better sense of that this week.
There is a LOT of data coming out in the next few days that will give important clues about the health of the economy. Beyond a slew of retail earnings reports, the government will report retail sales figures for October on Wednesday. Economists are forecasting a monthly jump of 0.9%. Sales were unchanged in September, a possible sign that inflation was taking its toll on consumers.
But the most recent Consumer Price Index figures for October provided some relief for shoppers…and Wall Street. The pace of year-over-year price increases slowed more than expected, sparking a massive stock market rally Thursday.
What will the Fed do next? Follow the economy, not what Jerome Powell says
Several major retailers are also on tap to report their results for the latest quarter…and potentially give outlooks about sales for the next few months. Walmart (WMT), Target (TGT), TJ Maxx and Marshalls owner TJX (TJX), Macy’s (M), Kohl’s (KSS) and Gap (GPS) are all on the earnings calendar for this week.
The Fed’s relentless rate hikes over the past few months have pushed credit card rates to all-time highs. So it will be costlier than ever for many consumers looking to buy gifts this year with their Visas and Mastercards. Black Friday, after all, is less than two weeks away.
Consumer spending rose 1.4% during the third quarter, according to the government’s most recent gross domestic product (GDP) report. That is still decent growth, but it’s a slowdown from the first and second quarters.
Inflation finally hurting sales?
The big question facing retailers is whether or not they are able to keep raising prices. So far, consumers have (perhaps begrudgingly) continued to spend despite any sticker shock. It helps, of course, that wage growth has remained fairly robust.
“Retailers have been able to pass on rising producer prices to consumers and maintain solid markups over cost,” said economists at Moody’s in a recent 2023 outlook report.
The Moody’s economists added that the still healthy labor market is one reason that consumer demand trends “have remained inordinately resilient.”

Retailers clearly need some good cheer around the holidays. Consumer stocks have been hit hard this year due to inflation worries and recession fears, plunging even more than the broader market.
The SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT), a fund that has Victoria’s Secret, Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF) and Gap among its top holdings, is down more than 25% this year.
Still, some experts worry that retailers may continue to struggle in 2023. Consumers may eventually need to watch their wallets more closely as worries about an imminent economic downturn grow.
“What makes us cautious is earnings estimates, which in some cases are a little too high, in our view. With slowing growth, those numbers need to come down,” said Matt Quinlan, a portfolio manager at Franklin Templeton, on a recent webcast.
Quinlan added that “some parts of the…consumer discretionary [sector] would be ones where earnings estimates need to be brought down a little bit more.”
Housing slowdown in focus
The Fed’s rate hikes may eventually slow broader consumer spending. But there’s one other notable area of the economy that has already been hit hard by the central bank’s aggressive tightening: the housing market.
Mortgage rates have spiked to above 7%, making it tougher for first-time home buyers to afford a house.
A report on housing starts and building permits data for October will come out towards the end of this week. So will figures for existing home sales. Economists surveyed by Reuters are forecasting that 4.4 million homes were sold last month. That would be down from 4.7 million homes in September and 6.3 million in October 2021.
The housing market may not necessarily be in the midst of a spectacular collapse like it was in the late 2000s after a subprime mortgage craze fueled a massive bubble. But home sales are clearly losing steam.
With that in mind, it will be interesting to see what home improvement retail giants Home Depot (HD) and Lowe’s (LOW), which both report earnings this week, have to say about housing.
Both companies may benefit from a “nesting” trend, where current homeowners decide to spend more on home improvement because they want to stay in their house. But the two retailers may get less of a lift if there are fewer new homebuyers looking to fix up houses.
Redfin shuts home-flipping business and cuts 13% of its workforce
Inflation could be a problem as well. When Home Depot reported its most recent earnings in August, it noted that customers didn’t make as many purchases as they did a year ago.
The number of overall transactions fell 3% from the same period of 2021. But that drop was offset by rising prices. Home Depot said that customers spent an average of a little more than $90 when shopping, up 9% from a year ago.
Investors seem nervous that rising prices will eventually hurt Home Depot and Lowe’s as well. Shares of Home Depot have fallen nearly 25% this year while Lowe’s stock is down about 20%.

Should Native Americans get preference over White people in adopting Native children? The Supreme Court may decide
By Harmeet Kaur, CNN
Published 9:40 AM EST, Sun November 13, 2022
A White couple in Texas is suing to overturn the Indian Child Welfare Act, which would make it easier for them to adopt YRJ, a Navajo girl who is living with them -- despite the wishes of the girl's tribe and great aunt.

CNN
 — 
Throughout its history, the US has adopted policies that threatened to wipe out Native American tribes and their cultures – or as one Army officer put it, “kill the Indian in him, and save the man.”
A lawsuit now before the Supreme Court, tribal nations argue, has the potential to do the same.
The Supreme Court heard oral arguments Wednesday in Haaland v. Brackeen, a series of consolidated cases that seek to overturn the Indian Child Welfare Act. The law, enacted in 1978 to address the high numbers of Native children being separated from their families, gives tribal nations a say in child welfare cases involving children who are members of a federally recognized tribe or eligible for membership.
It also establishes placement preferences for when a Native child is up for adoption, giving priority first to the child’s extended family, then other members of the child’s tribe and then other Native families.
At the center of the case is a White couple from Texas who ran into obstacles while attempting to adopt a Navajo boy they were fostering. Litigation giant Gibson Dunn took on the case for free, and the couple was ultimately able to adopt the child over a Navajo family.
But the couple, who are plaintiffs in the case along with other White foster parents and the state of Texas, is now arguing that the Indian Child Welfare Act places them “last in line” to adopt more Native children. In other words, they argue, it discriminates on the basis of race.
Tribal leaders and experts in federal Indian law say that misunderstands both how the Indian Child Welfare Act and tribal nations function.
“To say that this is all just about race or racism really undermines the separate sovereignty that these governments have and their separate identities as tribal nations,” says Elizabeth Reese, an assistant professor of law at Stanford University and a scholar of tribal and federal Indian law.
The case isn’t just about the welfare of Native children, Reese and others say. They view it as an attack on tribal sovereignty.
The law was a response to systemic harms
The Indian Child Welfare Act was enacted specifically to remedy federal policies that systematically separated Native children from their families and communities.
In the 19th and 20th centuries, tens of thousands of Native children were removed from their homes and forced to attend residential boarding schools in an attempt to assimilate them into White American society. They were forbidden from speaking their languages and stripped of their cultures, and an initial investigation found that the deaths of at least 500 American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian children could be attributed to the boarding schools – a number that is thought to be an underestimate.
Interior Department says Native American children were forced into assimilation at 408 federal boarding schools
As the residential schools fell out of favor, another policy aimed at assimilating Native Americans emerged. From 1958 to 1967, the federal government partnered with the Child Welfare League of America on the Indian Adoption Project, which placed hundreds of Native children in the homes of White families. It was billed as a progressive contrast to adoption practices at the time, which emphasized “matching” so that the child and adoptive parents appeared biologically related.
As many as one-third of Native children were removed from their homes in those years and placed with non-Native families, and congressional hearings on the issue revealed that ignorance and bias from child welfare workers contributed to their disproportionate removal.
“There was an erosion of language, culture, cohesion within the community, and an erosion of the civic life of tribal communities because we had federal and state-level policies that resulted in the dispossession of our children across Indian country,” Cherokee Nation Principal Chief Chuck Hoskin Jr. told CNN.
Congress passed the Indian Child Welfare Act in 1978, determining that it was in the best interests of Native children to remain connected to their communities and that those children were key to the continued existence of tribes. In the decades since, the law has been heralded as the “gold standard” of child welfare policy.
Opponents argue it hurts Native children
Opponents of the Indian Child Welfare Act, which include Republican states and conservative organizations such as the Goldwater Institute, argue that the Indian Child Welfare Act goes against the best interests of Native children by imposing standards that make it harder for them to be adopted into stable, loving homes.
“The best-interests-of-the-child standard is a holistic and individualized assessment that takes account of all of a child’s circumstances and needs and prioritizes their well-being,” Matthew McGill, a lawyer representing the non-Native adoptive families and a partner at Gibson Dunn, wrote in an email to CNN. “In the Supreme Court, the lawyer representing Indian tribes acknowledged that ICWA does not incorporate this familiar best-interests test.”
Native children are overrepresented in the foster care system, and critics of the law have said that its preferences are problematic because there are more Native children in foster care than there are Native homes to place them in.
But Kate Fort, director of the Indian Law Clinic at Michigan State University, said that courts must consider the child’s best interests, which in this case happens to include a child’s connection to their tribe, culture and community.
A group of non-Native foster parents, Republican states and conservative groups are seeking to overturn the Indian Child Welfare Act, enacted in 1978 to prevent the breakup of Native families. The US Supreme Court heard arguments in the case last week.

“ICWA doesn’t supplant or erase the best interest of the child. It supplements it,” she said.
When a Native child is placed in foster care, the arrangement is generally considered temporary, Fort said. The ultimate goal is to reunify that child with their parent, or when that isn’t an option, to find the best adoptive home for them.
“When we’re looking at a permanent placement, we’re in a different calculus for the best interest of the child than we are in a foster care placement,” Fort added. “We’re trying to find what is going to be good for this child when she’s seven, 16, 18 – when she ages out potentially of a stranger foster care home. Generally speaking for all kids, we know it’s with relatives and in their communities.”
Still, there are exceptions to the preferences outlined in the Indian Child Welfare Act. As Rebecca Nagle noted in The Atlantic, non-Native foster parents were able to adopt Native children over a blood relative in two of the three underlying custody cases in Haaland v. Brackeen.
“These preferences are just that – they’re preferences,” Reese said. “They still allow for the adoption of children by non-Indian families. The law itself is written to allow judges who are hearing cases involving the placement of Indian children to exercise their discretion about when it makes sense to depart from these placement preferences.”
Some also say the law amounts to reverse racism
One of the plaintiffs’ core arguments is that the Indian Child Welfare Act is racist.
In giving preferences to a child’s relatives, members of their tribe and other Native families when placing a Native child for adoption, the law discriminates against non-Native adoptive parents, according to the plaintiffs.
While Native Americans are often considered to be a racial group, tribes are political entities and citizenship in a tribe is a political status. The Indian Child Welfare Act doesn’t apply to any child with Native ancestry, but rather only to an “Indian child” – a legal definition that refers to a child who is a member of a tribe or a child whose parent is a tribal member and who is eligible for membership.
Opponents of the Indian Child Welfare Act are arguing that the law discriminates on the basis of race. Tribal nations say that misunderstands their political status.

Because of their unique political standing, tribes dispute the notion that the preferences outlined in the Indian Child Welfare Act amount to racial discrimination. The Supreme Court has agreed, holding in a 1974 case that such preferences weren’t discriminatory but rather “reasonably designed to further the cause of Indian self-government.”
The plaintiffs also assert that the law discriminates against Native children, stating in a court filing that it places them “in a disfavored position, depriving them of a placement decision based on their best interests, and instead requiring placements based on the child’s “biolog[y].”
The Sacheen Littlefeather controversy highlights a debate over what it means to be Native American
“In the United States, citizenship is based primarily on birth within the territory of the United States,” McGill, the lawyer representing the plaintiffs, wrote in an email to CNN. “ICWA classifies children based on their ancestry, and children are powerless to change that.”
But tribal citizenship isn’t limited to ancestry, said Cherokee Nation Deputy Attorney General Chrissi Nimmo. Just as in the US, there are other ways of becoming a citizen beyond where a person is born. For example, the Cherokee Nation grants citizenship to the descendants of people once enslaved by the tribe, whether or not they have Cherokee ancestry.
“There is some biological aspect to citizenship in that I’m a Cherokee citizen, and my children are eligible for citizenship,” Nimmo said. “But it’s the same biological aspect in born citizenship in the United States.”
But tribes see it as an attack on their sovereignty
For tribal nations, the Indian Child Welfare Act is about their future.
“There’s nothing that is more central to core self-governance and sovereignty than having the next generation of citizens in your government,” Nimmo said.
With this legal case, that future hangs in the balance. If the Supreme Court were to rule that tribes are racial groups rather than political entities and that the law is therefore unconstitutional, much of the legal basis for tribal sovereignty would be at risk, Reese said.
What Oklahoma's governor and others get wrong about tribal sovereignty
“If that is the case for the Indian Child Welfare Act, then there is little to say that that’s not the case for tons of other statutes across the federal code,” she said. “For example, [those codes] create health care for Indian persons under the Indian Health Service. Is that an impermissible racial discrimination? What about the holding of lands by the federal government in trust for specific Indian tribes?”
Another argument made by the plaintiffs – particularly that the Indian Child Welfare Act is an overreach of Congress’ powers regarding tribal affairs – could have similarly wide-ranging implications if the Court were to agree, she added. It could call into question virtually all of Title 25 of the US Code, a section of the law that pertains to Indians and tribes.
“If that whole section is constitutionally suspect, that’s a huge problem for tribes,” she said.

 — 
Between warnings of a recession, high inflation and layoff fears, the news is bleak. Why not have some chocolate?
Chocolate makers are reporting booming sales as stressed out customers reach for something sweet to take the edge off.
In the third quarter, sales of Hershey’s (HSY) chocolates, which include Reese’s, Kit Kat and Hershey bars, jumped 12.6% in retail. Mondelez (MDLZ), the global snack brand that makes Toblerone, Cadbury and others, said its chocolate sales grew 9.3% in the quarter.
Chocolate, like many comfort foods, got a boost during the pandemic. But unlike other categories such as pizza, where interest fell off as employees returned to the office and kids went back to school, chocolate is still growing — thanks in part to demand from stressed out consumers.
“Chocolate grew in 2020 and has maintained that growth, something many industries were not able to do,” according to a 2022 report from the research firm Mintel. “Increased at-home occasions, the need for fun and relief from stress, and the availability and convenience of chocolate all contributed to this upward trajectory.”
In the year through October 30, chocolate sales hit $17.7 billion in US retail, according to data from market research firm IRI, up from $14.6 billion for the year in 2019.

One reason for the growth is higher prices for groceries and snacks, including chocolate. The increase isn’t affecting sales too much — shoppers are not that sensitive to changes in the price of chocolate, said Dan Sadler, principal of client insights at IRI, who has expertise in the confections market and tracks price sensitivity.
In the second quarter, IRI found that elasticity for chocolate was about -.4. That means that a 10% increase in prices would result in only a 4% drop in sales by volume, Sadler explained.
“You can raise that price, and you’ll see a little bit of a hit to volume, but not a whole lot, not like you will in some other categories,” he said.
How America turned into a nation of snackers
Even chocolate makers have been surprised by how well demand is holding up.
Elasticity “remains below expectations,” said Mondelez CEO Dirk Van de Put during a recent analyst call discussing the company’s third-quarter results, lower even than before Covid. “We see consumers saying that chocolate is really something they cannot live without.”
Hershey raised its net sales and earnings outlook for the year on November 4th, when it reported third-quarter results that exceeded its expectations.
“Our products remain an affordable treat for families and for consumers,” said Hershey CEO Michele Buck during an analyst call. “We know that part of that is they want to reward themselves when times are tough. They also use these products to relieve stress. And we think that those trends will continue.”
Customers are making some changes, she noted, like shopping at value channels or choosing value packs.
It’s not s’mores without Hershey
Companies like Mondelez and Hershey are largely spared competition from store brands, or private label, which are gaining ground as grocery prices rise.
According to IRI, just 2.7% of the US chocolate retail market is made up of private label, while that portion is much higher in other categories. In dairy milk, for example, store brands account for about 62% of sales. Even in salty snacks and non-chocolate candy, private label share is at 4.8%.
Shoppers are “brand specific” when it comes to chocolate, Sadler said. “You’re gonna make s’mores with a Hershey bar, you’re not going to substitute with something else.”
Mondelez benefits from that kind of brand loyalty, as well. “Shoppers continue to say they are much less likely to switch to private label in chocolate and biscuits compared to other categories,” said Mondelez’s Van de Put during the call.
Eventually, higher prices may hit the chocolate category. IRI is seeing volume sales start to dip, Sadler noted, suggesting that consumers are becoming more price sensitive.
And though private label sales pale in comparison to national brands, they are also growing at a faster clip than branded chocolate.
IRI’s data shows that private label sales rose 16% in the year through October 30 compared to the year before, while national brands grew by 8.8%.
Still, chocolate isn’t going anywhere. The sweet’s “position as an accessible indulgence will help shield it from significant impacts,” Mintel’s report said.

My son has been asking for a dress. I finally decided to just get him dresses despite being afraid he’d get teased by other kids. Today, the boy next door asked why he was wearing a dress, I said “he wanted one” and he said “okay” then they continued to play. The kids are alright

'Very good news' for Biden: CNN projects Democrats will keep control of Senate
03:05 - Source: CNN
Start your week smart: Midterms, Iran, Covid-19, Air show crash, Dolly Parton
By Andrew Torgan, CNN
Published 8:50 AM EST, Sun November 13, 2022
CNN
 — 
Today is World Kindness Day. Do with that information what you will. Sure, it’s just another made-up day, but unlike candy corn or cilantro, kindness is a far less divisive subject.
Here’s what else you need to know to Start Your Week Smart.
The weekend that was
• Democrats will keep their narrow majority in the US Senate for the next two years, CNN projects, after victories in close contests in Nevada and Arizona.
• Iranian security forces have killed at least 326 people since nationwide protests erupted two months ago, the Norway-based Iran Human Rights NGO group has claimed. 
• A cruise ship with around 800 Covid-positive passengers docked in Sydney, Australia, on Saturday after being hit by a wave of infections. 
• Two World War II-era military planes collided in mid-air and crashed during an airshow in Dallas on Saturday afternoon, killing at least two people onboard, officials said.
• Dolly Parton is the latest recipient of the $100 million Courage and Civility Award from Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.
The week ahead
Monday
President Joe Biden is expected to meet with Chinese leader Xi Jinping this week ahead of the G20 summit – their first in-person encounter since Biden took office and one that will offer a clarifying opportunity for the world’s most important bilateral relationship.
It’s also the birthday of King Charles III, who turns 74 on November 14.
Tuesday
The G20 summit officially gets underway on the Indonesian island of Bali. The G20 is comprised of 19 of the world’s major economies – including Russia –and the European Union, but Russian President Vladimir Putin will not attend the summit in person. Putin’s decision saves him the embarrassment of being confronted – or shunned – by other world leaders over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
Former President Donald Trump has said he plans to make “a very big announcement” at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida on Tuesday. The event is widely expected to formally kick off his third campaign for the White House. 
Coincidentally, former Vice President Mike Pence’s memoir will also be published on Tuesday, one week after Election Day, as he, too, considers a possible run for the White House in 2024.
Wednesday
NASA officials are looking at November 16 as the possible launch date for the Artemis I moon rocket, which was on the launchpad last week as Hurricane Nicole made landfall as a Category 1 storm roughly 70 miles south of the Kennedy Space Center in Florida.
Friday
On November 18, 1928, Disney icon Mickey Mouse made his first appearance in the short film “Steamboat Willie.” That means that Mickey – and Minnie – will be turning 94 years old. 
More midterm takeaways
In this week’s One Thing podcast, CNN Chief National Correspondent John King takes a break from the Magic Wall to share some early lessons from the midterm elections. “Sometimes when we’re talking about the polarization of the divide, we should actually respect that this is a big, complicated country,” King says. Listen here for more.

What’s happening in entertainment
TV and streaming
The Season 5 premiere of “Yellowstone” airs tonight at 8 p.m. ET on the Paramount Network. It opens on election night as Kevin Costner’s John Dutton wins the race for governor of Montana.
Meanwhile, over on Paramount+, Sylvester Stallone takes on his first major TV role in “Tulsa King,” a new series from the creator of “Yellowstone.” In the series premiere that drops today, Stallone’s Dwight Manfredi gets out of prison after 25 years only to find that those running the mob in his old stomping grounds of New York don’t want him around. As a result, he’s unceremoniously exiled by his boss to set up shop in Oklahoma. 
In theaters
“She Said” stars Carey Mulligan and Zoe Kazan as New York Times reporters Megan Twohey and Jodi Kantor, who break one of the most important stories in a generation — a story that helped launch the #MeToo movement and shattered decades of silence around the subject of sexual assault in Hollywood. “She Said” opens on Friday.
The comedy/horror film “The Menu” features Anya Taylor-Joy and Nicholas Hoult as a couple who pay a fortune to dine at an exclusive restaurant on a remote private island where Chef Julian Slowik – played by Ralph Fiennes – has prepared a lavish menu, albeit with some shocking surprises.

Georgia candidate makes history as first known Muslim and Palestinian woman elected to state House
By Alaa Elassar, CNN
Updated 10:02 PM EST, Sun November 13, 2022

CNN
 — 
Ruwa Romman remembers the sadness she felt as an 8-year-old girl sitting in the back of a school bus watching classmates point to her house and erupt in vicious laughter.
“There’s the bomb lab,” they jeered in yet another attempt to brand her family as terrorists.
On Tuesday, the same girl – now a 29-year-old community organizer – made history as the first known Muslim woman elected to the Georgia House of Representatives, and the first Palestinian American elected to any office in the state.
After 10 months of relentless campaigning, the Democrat said she is eager to begin representing the people of District 97, which includes Berkeley Lake, and parts of Duluth, Norcross, and Peachtree Corners in Gwinnett County.
As an immigrant, the granddaughter of Palestinian refugees, and a Muslim woman who wears the hijab, or Islamic headscarf, the road to political office hasn’t been easy, especially in the very Christian and conservative South.
“I could write chapters about what I have gone through,” Romman told CNN, listing the many ways she’s faced bigotry or discrimination.
“All the times I am ‘randomly’ selected by TSA, teachers putting me in a position where I had to defend Islam and Muslims to classrooms being taught the wrong things about me and my identity… it colored my entire life.”
A Marine who hated Muslims went to a mosque to plant a bomb. His intended victims ended up saving his life
But those hardships only fueled her passion for civic engagement, especially among marginalized communities, Romman said.
“Who I am has really taught me to look for the most marginalized because they are the ones who don’t have resources or time to spend in the halls of political institutions to ask for the help they need,” she said.
Romman began in 2015 working with the Georgia Muslim Voter Project to increase voter turnout among local Muslim Americans. She also helped establish the state chapter for the Council on American-Islamic Relations, the nation’s largest Muslim civil rights and advocacy organization.
Soon after, Romman began working with the wider community. Her website boasts: “Ruwa has volunteered in every election cycle since 2014 to help flip Georgia blue.”
She said her main focus is “putting public service back into politics,” which she intends to do by helping expand access to health care, bridging the economic opportunity gap, protecting the right to vote, and making sure people have access to lifesaving care like abortion.
“I think a lot of people overlook state legislators because they think they’re local and don’t have a lot of impact, not realizing that state legislatures have the most direct impact on them,” Romman said. “Every law that made us mad or happy started in the state legislature somewhere.”
‘We are real people with real dreams’
Romman said she always wanted to influence the political process, but never thought she’d be a politician.
The decision to run for office came after attending a Georgia Muslim Voter Project training session for women from historically marginalized communities, where a journalist covering the event asked if she wanted to run for office.
“I told her no, I don’t think so, and she ended up writing a beautiful piece about Muslim women in Georgia, but she started it with ‘Ruwa Romman is contemplating a run for office,’ and I wasn’t,” Romman recounted. “But when it came out, the community saw it and the response was so overwhelmingly positive and everyone kept telling me to do it.”
Two weeks later, Romman and a group of volunteers launched a campaign.

She was surrounded by family, friends and community members who were rooting for her success. Together, they knocked on 15,000 doors, sent 75,000 texts, and made 8,000 phone calls.
Her Republican opponent John Chan didn’t fight fair, she said.
“My opponent had used anti-Muslim rhetoric against me, saying I had ties to terrorism, at one point flat-out supporting an ad that called me a terrorist plant,” she said.
Flyers supporting Chan’s candidacy insinuated she is associated with terrorist organizations.
Chan did not respond to CNN’s request for comment.
It was the same type of bullying Romman faced as a schoolgirl, she said. Only this time, she wasn’t alone. Thousands of people had her back.
“What was incredible is that people in my district sent his messaging to me and said ‘This is unacceptable. How can we help? How can we get involved? How can we support you?’ and that was such an incredible moment for me,” she said.

It was also ironic, Romman added, because her passion for her community and social justice is rooted in her faith: “Justice is a central tenant of Islam,” she pointed out. “It inspires me to be good to others, care for my neighbors, and protect the marginalized.”
It’s also rooted in her family’s experience as Palestinian refugees, who she said were banished from their homeland by Israel in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War.
“My Palestinian identify has instilled in me a focus on justice and care for others,” Romman said. “Everyone deserves to live with dignity. I hope that Palestinians everywhere see this as proof that consistently showing up and working hard can be history making.
“I may not have much power on foreign policy, but I sincerely hope that I can at least remind people that Palestinians are not the nuisance, or the terrorists, or any other terrible aspersion that society has put on us,” she added. “We are real people with real dreams.”
‘Representation that looks like us’
Romman joins three other Muslim Americans elected to state and local office in Georgia this election cycle, according to the Georgia Muslim Voter Project.
The other three candidates, all Democrats, were Nabilah Islam, the first known Muslim woman elected to the Georgia State Senate, Sheikh Rahman, elected to the Georgia State Senate, and Farooq Mughal, elected to the Georgia State House.
'Those people are not me'
“We’ve had Muslim representation at the state level in Georgia, but these wins take representation for Georgia Muslims further than ever before because now we have more gender and ethnic representation for Muslims,” the group’s executive director Shafina Khabani told CNN. “Not only will we have a representation that looks like us and aligns with our values, but we will have an opportunity to advocate and influence policies that impact our communities directly.”
“Having diversity in political representation means better laws, more accepting leadership, and welcoming policies for all of Georgia,” she said.
More than anything, Romman hopes her election points to a future free of hate and bigotry.
“I think this proves that people have learned that Muslims are part of this community and that tide of Islamophobia is hopefully starting to recede,” Romman added.
Looking back at her childhood, Romman wishes she could tell her younger self things would get better with time, and that one day she would not only make Georgia history, but hopefully a real difference in the world.

 — 
A suspect is in custody related to an explosion that killed at least six people and injured at least 81 others in Istanbul on Sunday, Turkey’s interior ministry said early Monday.
The incident has been deemed a terrorist attack, Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay said Sunday, according to state news agency Anadolu.
“We consider it to be a terrorist act as a result of an attacker, whom we consider to be a woman, detonating the bomb,” Oktay told reporters Sunday.
Turkish officials believe Kurdish separatists from the Kurdistan Worker’s Party (PKK) and the Democratic Union Party (PYD) were most likely behind the deadly suspected bomb attack, the country’s interior minister, Suleyman Soylu, told reporters Monday.
“It is PKK/PYD terrorist organization according to our preliminary findings,” Soylu said in a press conference at the scene of Sunday’s attack on Istiklal Avenue, Istanbul.
Soylu did not elaborate or provide details of how investigators had reached this conclusion.
“A little while ago the person who left the bomb (was) taken under custody by teams of Istanbul Police Department. Before their arrest 21 more people were also taken under custody,” the minister said. “The face of terrorism is bitter, but we will continue this struggle to the end, whatever the cost is.”
CCTV footage shows a woman sitting on a bench for more than 40 minutes and then getting up one or two minutes before the explosion, leaving a bag or plastic bag behind, according to Turkish Justice Minister Bekir Bozdag.
Bozdag, who made the comments in an interview with privately owned A Haber news channel, said Turkish security forces believe the woman is the suspect, and officials are investigating her.
“There are two possibilities. Either that bag or plastic bag has a mechanism in it, it explodes on its own or someone detonates it from afar. All of these are currently under investigation.” he added.
“The name of the woman is unknown,” he said. “All the recordings and data about the woman are being analyzed.”
Ambulances and police respond to the scene in a bustling part of Istanbul.

The blast happened on Istiklal Street in Beyoglu Square, in the heart of Turkey’s largest city, Istanbul Governor Ali Yerlikaya said.
“We wish God’s mercy on those who lost their lives and a speedy recovery to the injured,” Yerlikaya tweeted.

The six people killed include Yusuf Meydan, a member of Turkey’s Ministry of Family and Social Services, and his daughter Ecrin, according to Derya Yanık, the minister of the agency.
Soylu, the interior minister, said Monday that 50 of the 81 people injured have been discharged from the hospital, with 31 people still being treated.
Turkey’s conflict with Kurdish separatist groups has spanned four decades and claimed tens of thousands of lives. The PKK has been designated a terrorist organization by Turkey, the United States and the European Union.
“In particular, the insincerity of our so-called allies who seem friendly to us, who either hide terrorists in their own country, or feeds terrorists in the areas they occupy and send them money from their own senates, is obvious,” Soylu said.
“We will give them a response in the near future, to those who caused us this pain in Beyoglu Istiklal Street so they experience more and more pain,” Soylu said.
‘What looked like the aftermath of a war zone’
Witness Tariq Keblaoui said he was shopping on Istiklal Street when the explosion happened about 10 meters (32.8 feet) ahead of him.
“People were scattering immediately,” said Keblaoui, a Lebanese-based journalist who was on his last day of vacation in the city.
Turkish police and explosives experts work the scene of the explosion Sunday.

“Very shortly after, I could see how many injured were on the ground,” Keblaoui told CNN. He says he saw dead bodies and victims who were seriously injured.
“There was a man in the store bleeding from his ears and his legs, and his friends were crying near him,” Keblaoui said.

Istiklal Street was packed with visitors when the blast happened Sunday afternoon, he said.
“It went very quickly from a very peaceful Sunday with a very crowded street full of tourists to being what looked like the aftermath of a war zone,” Keblaoui said.
Countries unite in condemning the attack
News of the explosion led to a torrent of condolences from around the world.
French President Emmanuel Macron, whose own country suffered a deadly terror attack exactly seven years earlier, shared his sympathies for the Turkish people.

“On this day so symbolic for our Nation, while we think of the victims who fell on November 13, 2015, the Turkish people are struck by an attack in their heart, Istanbul,” Macron tweeted Sunday. “To the Turks: we share your pain. We stand with you in the fight against terrorism.”
European Council President Charles Michel shared his condolences after Sunday’s deadly blast.

“Horrific news from Istanbul tonight,” he said. “All our thoughts are with those currently responding and the people of Türkiye at this very distressing time.”
NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg tweeted his “deepest condolences” to the Turkish people, adding that NATO “stands in solidarity with our ally” Turkey.

The United States “strongly condemns the act of violence that took place today in Istanbul,” White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Sunday. “Our thoughts are with those who were injured and our deepest condolences go to those who lost loved ones.”
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky tweeted of his “deep sadness” at the news of the blast. “I offer my condolences to the families of those who lost their lives and wish a speedy recovery to the injured,” Zelensky said. “The pain of the friendly Turkish people is our pain.”

Rockefeller Center Christmas tree arrives in New York City after road trip from Maryland
By David Williams, CNN
Published 1:27 PM EST, Sat November 13, 2021

 — 
This year’s Rockefeller Center Christmas tree got a well-earned police escort into New York City Saturday morning to cap off a lengthy road trip from Maryland.
The 79-foot-tall Norway Spruce arrived Saturday morning on a flatbed semi-trailer and the NYPD Highway Unit helped it negotiate the city streets from the highway to its final destination.
The tree, which is 46 feet wide and weighs 12 tons, was cut down on Thursday in Elkton, Maryland, for its trip to New York, according to the Rockefeller Center Facebook page. It’s the first time the tree has come from Maryland, Rockefeller Center posted.
The two-day trip was a challenge.
National forests will let you cut your own Christmas tree
“We need New Jersey permits to bring it up on the turnpike, it stays overnight by the Meadowlands. We need Maryland and Delaware permits for it to travel because it’s an oversized load. It has to have special permits, special escorts – police escort, obviously – for security reasons and just to get it here safe,” New York Truck Escorts and Permits President Maureen Mandich told CNN affiliate WABC.
Workers could be seen using a large crane to lift the tree into place on Saturday morning.
Where to go for the holidays: Experts weigh in on destinations and risks
It will be strung with 50,000 multi-colored LED lights on more than 5 miles of wire and then topped with a Swarovski star that weighs about 900 pounds and is covered with 3 million crystals, the Rockefeller Center website said.
The traditional tree lighting ceremony is scheduled for December 1.

6 dead after a pair of vintage military aircraft collided at a Texas air show
By Susannah Cullinane, Emma Tucker, Alaa Elassar and Andi Babineau, CNN

CNN
 — 
Six people are dead after two World War II-era military planes collided midair and crashed at Dallas Executive Airport during an airshow Saturday afternoon, killing all on board, the Dallas County Medical Examiner’s office said Sunday.
“We can confirm that there are six (fatalities),” a spokesperson for the office told CNN in a phone call.
More than 40 fire rescue units responded to the scene after the two vintage planes – a Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress and a Bell P-63 Kingcobra – went down during the Wings Over Dallas airshow.
In video footage of the crash described by Dallas’ mayor as “heartbreaking,” the planes are seen breaking apart midair after the collision, then hitting the ground within seconds before bursting into flames.
Here are the latest developments as investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board begin their investigation:
The B-17 Flying Fortress, one of the planes that crashed at the airshow at Dallas Executive Airport on Saturday, Nov. 12, 2022, normally had a crew of 4 to 5 people.
What we know about the crew members killed
The crash took place at around 1:20 p.m. Saturday, the Federal Aviation Administration said.
The Allied Pilots Association – the labor union representing American Airlines pilots – identified two pilot retirees and former union members among those killed in the collision.
Terry Barker and Len Root were crew on the B-17 Flying Fortress during the airshow, the APA said on social media.
“Our hearts go out to their families, friends, and colleagues past and present,” the union said. The APA is offering professional counseling services at their headquarters in Fort Worth following the incident.
Terry Barker killed in the Dallas Saturday plane crash
The death of Barker was also announced by Keller Mayor Armin Mizani on Sunday morning in a Facebook post.
“Keller is grieving as we have come to learn that husband, father, Army veteran, and former Keller City Councilman Terry Barker was one of the victims of the tragic crash at the Dallas Air Show,” Mizani wrote.
“Terry Barker was beloved by many. He was a friend and someone whose guidance I often sought. Even after retiring from serving on the City Council and flying for American Airlines, his love for community was unmistakable.”
A 30-year plus veteran of the Civil Air Patrol’s Ohio Wing, Maj. Curtis J. Rowe, was also among those killed in the collision, Col. Pete Bowden, the agency’s commander, said Sunday.
Rowe served in several positions throughout his tenure with the Civil Air Patrol, from safety officer to operations officer, and most recently, he was the Ohio Wing maintenance officer, Bowden said. Rowe’s family was notified of his death Saturday evening, the commander added.
“I reach to find solace in that when great aviators like Curt perish, they do so doing what they loved. Curt touched the lives of thousands of his fellow CAP members, especially the cadets who he flew during orientation flights or taught at Flight Academies and for that, we should be forever grateful,” Bowden wrote in a Facebook post.
“To a great aviator, colleague, and Auxiliary Airman, farewell,” he said.
In a Saturday news conference, Hank Coates, president and CEO of the Commemorative Air Force, an organization which preserves and maintains vintage military aircraft, told reporters the B-17 “normally has a crew of four to five. That was what was on the aircraft,” while the P-63 is a “single-piloted fighter type aircraft.”
Debris from two planes that crashed during the airshow. The B-17 was one of about 45 complete surviving examples of the model, which was produced by Boeing and other airplane manufacturers during World War II.
Three more victims were identified in a release from the Commemorative Air Force, which hosted the event.
“We are heartbroken to announce that the following members of the Commemorative Air Force went west on Saturday,” the statement said, using the phrase pilots use when one of their own has died.
Craig Hutain was a United Airlines pilot and executive officer with Tora! Tora! Tora! Airshows. In a bio on the company website, Hutain wrote he started flying with his father at 10 years old. He took his first solo flight at 17, became a flight instructor in college at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in aeronautical engineering, and got a job with an airline in 1982. He was married, with two daughters and four grandchildren.
Kevin “K5” Michels and Dan Ragan were named as the other victims. CNN is working to obtain more information about Michels and Ragan.
The Commemorative Air Force identified both aircraft as based in Houston.
No spectators or others on the ground were reported injured, although the debris field from the collision includes the Dallas Executive Airport grounds, Highway 67 and a nearby strip mall.
Rare aircraft involved
The B-17 was part of the collection of the Commemorative Air Force, nicknamed “Texas Raiders,” and had been kept in a hangar in Conroe, Texas, near Houston.
It was one of about 45 complete examples of the model, only nine of which were airworthy.
The P-63 was even rarer. Some 14 examples are known to survive, four of which in the US were airworthy, including one owned by the Commemorative Air Force.
More than 12,000 B-17s were produced by Boeing, Douglas Aircraft and Lockheed between 1936 and 1945, with nearly 5,000 lost during the war, and most of the rest scrapped by the early 1960s. About 3,300 P-63s were produced by Bell Aircraft between 1943 and 1945 and were principally used by the Soviet Air Force in World War II.
A frame from a video taken at the airshow shows smoke rising after the crash.
NTSB launches go-team
The FAA was leading the investigation Saturday, but the NTSB took over the investigation once its team reached the scene, the agency said at a news conference Sunday. The team dispatched by the NTSB consists of technical experts who are regularly sent to plane crash sites to investigate the collision, according to the NTSB.
The NTSB has received the air show common frequency recording, which is the verbal radio transmissions between pilots, and it will be processed by an investigative specialist, NTSB Member Michael Graham said in an update Monday.
Neither aircraft was equipped with a flight data recorder or cockpit voice recorder, often known as the “black box,” Graham said.
“However, we recovered this morning the electronic flight display from the B-17 and a GPS navigational unit from the P-63,” he said in an update Monday.
The units from the two aircraft were damaged during the accident, according to Graham, and are being sent to the NTSB recorder lab in Washington, D.C., to determine “whether data and relevant information can be recovered from both units.”
“The NTSB’s recorder lab specializes in recovering data from electronic devices and avionics and the data often assist in determining the probable cause,” Graham said.
Data that these types of units “may have,” according to Graham, would be things like GPS location, possible altitudes of the aircraft, and the airspeeds of the aircraft.
Investigators surveyed the accident site using both an NTSB drone and a photograph of the scene from the ground to document the area before the wreckage is moved to a secure location, Graham said earlier.
“We have recovered the wreckage of the P-63 as of this morning, and it has been transported to a secure location and it’ll be laid out for examination and analysis,” Graham said. “Rain has delayed further recovery of the B-17. The recovery process will continue tomorrow, weather permitting.”
Graham asked anyone with photos or videos of the incident to share them with the NTSB.
“They’ll be very critical to analyze the collision and also tie that in with the aircraft control recordings to determine why the two aircraft collided and to determine, basically, the how and why this accident happened and then eventually, hopefully, maybe make some safety recommendations to prevent it from happening in the future,” he said.
According to Coates, the individuals flying the aircraft in his group’s airshows are volunteers and follow a strict training process. Many of them are airline pilots, retired airline pilots or retired military pilots.
“The maneuvers that they (the aircraft) were going through were not dynamic at all,” Coates noted. “It was what we call ‘Bombers on Parade.”
“This is not about the aircraft. It’s just not,” Coates said. “I can tell you the aircraft are great aircraft. They’re safe. They’re very well-maintained. The pilots are very well-trained. So it’s difficult for me to talk about it because I know all these people. These are family, and they’re good friends.”
While neither aircraft did not have a flight data recorder or a cockpit voice recorder, and “nor are they required to,” Graham said the NTSB would be looking “down the road” at whether it is something that needs to be recommended.
“We also must remember these are very vintage, old 1940’s aircraft. So that’d be something that we’ll look at as a possible recommendation down the road, but I have nothing further on that to say if that is what it would be,” he added.
A preliminary accident report is expected in four to six weeks, but a full report on the investigation may not arrive for 12 to 18 months.
The Wings Over Dallas event, which was scheduled to run through Sunday, was canceled, according to the organizer’s website.

Alex Pereira stuns Israel Adesanya to become undisputed UFC middleweight champion
By Issy Ronald, CNN

 — 
Alex Pereira became the undisputed middleweight UFC champion on Saturday, defeating Israel Adesanya on a technical knock-out in front of a sold-out Madison Square Gardens in New York.
It was a stunning come-from-behind victory with Pereira, competing in just his fourth UFC fight and eighth overall MMA fight, billed as the underdog against Adesanya who was attempting to win a record sixth consecutive title defense.
And for much of the fight, it seemed as though Adesanya would achieve that record with Pereira languishing behind on the judges’ scorecards until the final round.
But the Brazilian rallied and hit Adesanya with a flurry of shots in the fifth round to force a referee stoppage and a TKO victory.
“I’m very happy,” Pereira said afterwards, according the UFC website. “It was an excellent work. And I’m not just saying from when I entered the Organization but everything I’ve been doing to get here.
“And what I did to be here getting the belt. It was very difficult. I had to overcome some tough opponents but I did it.”

The two men had met twice previously in kickboxing before they joined the UFC. Pereira had won both bouts, becoming the only man to ever knock out Adesanya.
Adesanya landed the first decisive blow of the night with a one-two that had Pereira reeling but it came in the final seconds of the first round, allowing the 35-year-old to recover for the next round.
And the defending champion’s onslaught continued in the next three rounds, leaving Adesanya ahead on all three judges’ scorecards going into the fifth and final round.
Aware that he needed to find the finish in the fifth round, Pereira unleashed all his power and Adesanya ultimately couldn’t offer a response.
Meanwhile, in the co-main event, Zhang Weili won the women’s strawweight Championship, the second title of her career, by defeating Carla Esparaza by submission with a rear-naked choke in the second round.
“Today is like a dream come true. Ever since I lost the belt, I’ve dreamt of this moment,” she said afterwards, according to the BBC.

Inside the superstar affair for the funeral of Migos rapper Takeoff

CNN
 — 
State Farm Arena was transformed into a church Friday as family and fans gathered to celebrate the earthly departure of Takeoff from Migos.
The three-hour sendoff was a superstar affair, featuring performances from Justin Bieber, Chloe Bailey and Yolanda Adams, as well as a poem by Drake, and words of remembrance from Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens and the founders of Migos’ label, Quality Control Music.
Cousin Offset, who along with Takeoff’s uncle, Quavo, formed the platinum hit factory known as Migos, struggled to compose himself remembering his bandmate, who he grew up with and considered a brother. His head down, dreadlocks obscuring his face, he repeatedly apologized.
Offset repeatedly breaks down Friday during Takeoff's memorial service at Atlanta's State Farm Arena.

“I love you, dog. I love you,” he said.
Offset hasn’t been able to sleep or eat following the November 1 killing, he told the several thousand people in attendance, most of them dressed in black. Every time he dozes off, he said, he wakes up hoping news of his 28-year-old cousin’s fatal shooting in Houston was a terrible dream.
“I wish we could laugh again,” he said. “I wish I could smoke one with you.”
He closed saying how Migos changed the future of music – “You did that, Take” – and called for more brotherhood and fellowship in the world before asking the crowd to pray with him.
Drake delivers poem
The ceremony opened with about an hour of gospel music. White roses covered the stage, and Takeoff’s casket sat at the foot of stairs made to resemble mother of pearl. Acrobats in angel outfits danced in the back corners, suspended from white ribbons, as a choir sang. An infinity symbol with Takeoff’s signature rocket emblem at its center ringed the arena, a nod not only to his latest productions but also to how he’ll be remembered – forever.
Bieber took the stage in a dark toboggan, as box candles on the stadium screens bathed the arena floor in a soft glow. Perched on a stool with only a piano backing him, the two-time Grammy winner performed “Ghost.”
“And if you can’t be next to me/Your memory is ecstasy/I miss you more than life,” he crooned.
Drake, who in 2013 catapulted the rising stars into an altogether other universe when he remixed and added a verse to their hit, “Versace,” leaned on British entertainer Joyce Grenfell and writer Maya Angelou in his eulogy.
After quoting Maya Angelou, Drake delivers his own poem during Takeoff's Celebration of Life.

He quoted from Grenfell: “If I should go before the rest of you/Break not a flower nor inscribe a stone/Nor when I’m gone speak in a Sunday voice/But be the usual selves that I have known.”
He then paraphrased Angelou’s “When Great Trees Fall,” a poem on how it’s understandable to be sad when great trees are felled, or when great souls pass, but it’s wise to remember, “They existed. They existed/We can be. Be and be better/For they existed.”
The hip-hop superstar, who just released an album with Atlanta’s 21 Savage, then recited his own poem, “We Should Do That More,” remembering how he got to know Migos on their 54-city tour in 2018. He teared up recalling the Swiss wristwatch, an Audemars Piguet, that Takeoff gave him as a gift
“I miss performing with my brothers,” he said. “We should do that more.”
The quiet Migo
Takeoff will always be remembered as the quiet Migo, but several speakers cautioned the crowd not to mistake his silence for a lack of things to say. He is regarded by many as the best rhymesmith of the trio, and Jesse Curney III, pastor of the Lilburn church Takeoff’s family attends, shared a story that Quavo once told him about Takeoff’s sobriquet.
Where Quavo and Offset needed multiple takes to get their verses onto tracks, retaking and retaking until they got it right, Takeoff – the youngest of the three – would walk up to the mic and lay down his lyrics in one perfect take. “He was an introvert,” the pastor said, “but he trusted God” to not hold back.

Between Bailey’s stirring rendition of Beyonce’s “Heaven” and Adams’ performance of the gospel song, “The Battle is Not Yours,” Takeoff’s family members took the podium to offer fond memories of the humble, wise, peaceful young man who always wanted to be a rapper but never fretted over credit or the spotlight. Even as a baby, he had a unique voice, his mother, Titania Davenport-Treet, said.
“I could tell his cry from any other child,” she said, adding that God must have given him that voice because he always knew what he wanted to be.
He was quiet but always paid attention, family members said, and he never bothered anyone. He was the funniest guy in the room, and no matter how famous he got, he never stopped putting family first and making sure their needs were met, they said.
“He hugged so tight, you could feel the love transferring through him,” his mother said.
Fans lined up hours before event
State Farm was a fitting venue for Takeoff’s farewell. The rapper was often courtside – usually with Quavo and Offset – for Atlanta Hawks games, iced out and dripping. For years, his music has bellowed through the PA system during timeouts and replay reviews.
Though doors did not open until an hour before the noon event, fans began lining up outside the arena at around 8:30 a.m., despite a cool, steady drizzle. Around 10, a woman held her arm out of a passing silver Mazda and barked, “Rest in peace, Takeoff.” The fans in line waved back.
Kalandrick Woods, 24, and girlfriend Kailey Allen, 20, of Covington, were second in line. Woods took the day off as a sandblast machine operator, and they drove about 45 minutes to get downtown.
Woods became melancholy when asked his favorite song – “Last Memory” off Takeoff’s 2018 debut solo effort – and said it’s still hard to talk about his favorite Migo. He cried when he heard the news, he said.
“I’m still depressed about it,” he said.
Woods likes that Takeoff was known to keep to himself, but by no means did that mean he was the lesser third of the group. With every new song, he appeared more developed as a lyricist, able to switch from rapid fire rap to deliberate four- or five-word bursts that painted vivid scenes. He put on mind-blowing displays of lyricism on 2014’s “Cross the Country” and more recently on his and Quavo’s “Integration,” staying on beat like a metronome as he flipped styles on the tracks.
“Deadshot (brrt)/AK make that head rock (brrt)” is the beginning of Fifi Solomon’s favorite Takeoff verse, though she had to think on it for a few seconds. From Migos’ 2017 hit, “Slippery,” Takeoff goes last – following Quavo, Offset and fellow ATLien Gucci Mane – and brings his band’s Quentin Tarantinoesque cartel personae into graphic focus.
“He said a lot in just a few words,” Solomon said. “He was the quietest, but I think he was the deepest lyrically.”
Solomon, 25, and her friend, Nani Kidane, 28, traveled from Migos’ onetime home base of Gwinnett County for the funeral. The band’s impact reached well beyond Atlanta, they said. They were trendsetters in fashion and influenced the way rappers inject ad-libs into their music.
They also set an example with their work ethic, Kidane said. Takeoff will be dearly missed, she said.
“I’m a big fan,” Solomon said. “He was my favorite lyrically out of the group, and he’s from where I’m from so it hit harder.”
Added Kidane, “It hit close to home being from Gwinnett.”
Impact anything but quiet
Maliyah Tindall, 22, of Riverdale, and Sequoia Thomas, 20, of Atlanta, also cited Takeoff’s “Slippery” verse as one of their favorites. The pair drove from Clayton State University in Morrow, about 30 minutes away, to pay their respects.
“He’s huge for the culture,” Thomas said before the funeral. “They paved the way for a lot of rappers who are going to be here today.”
“He was quiet but had a big impact,” Tindall said, spurring Thomas to add, “Like a tame lion.”
Migos were a fixture of Tindall’s and Thomas’ adolescence, they said, and he didn’t always get the recognition he deserved, but he showed up on every track.
“He’d even take over people’s songs outside Migos,” Thomas said of his features with other artists, including Lil Wayne, Roddy Rich and Travis Scott.
Takeoff seemed aware of his notoriety as the subdued Migo, but the Lawrenceville-born rap star also seemed ready to shake the reputation, eerily telling the podcast, “Drink Champs,” last month, “It’s time to pop it, you know what I mean? It’s time to give me my flowers, you know what I mean? I don’t want them later on when I ain’t here. I want them right now, so …”
Quavo recalls how he and his nephew, Takeoff, wanted to be pro wrestlers as kids.
Kevin Mazur/Getty Images
After more than a dozen Migos mixtapes and four studio albums – two of them platinum – Takeoff and Quavo recently announced they’d be performing as Unc & Phew. Last month, the pair released, “Only Built for Infinity Links,” with Offset noticeably missing. Though the band had not officially broken up, there were rumors of some sort of beef among the trio.
It was abundantly clear from Friday’s remembrance that Offset would give a lot to speak with his cousin one more time. Migos fans are hopeful that Takeoff’s tragic killing might help Quavo and Offset reconsider whatever drove them to move in different directions.
“I hope they can set aside their differences,” Solomon told CNN. “You know, come together for Takeoff.”

Iranian refugee who inspired Spielberg’s film ‘The Terminal’ dies inside Paris airport
By Saskya Vandoorne and Maija Ehlinger, CNN
Updated 9:16 PM EST, Sun November 13, 2022

 — 
Mehran Karimi Nasseri, the man who had lived inside the Paris-Charles de Gaulle airport for years and inspired Steven Spielberg’s 2004 film “The Terminal”, died Saturday at the same airport.
Nasseri was pronounced dead by the airport medical team at Terminal 2F and had died of natural causes, a spokesperson for the airport told CNN.
Nasseri, an Iranian refugee, was en route to England via Belgium and France in 1988 when he lost his papers and could not board a flight nor leave the airport and was stuck in limbo until 2006.
He had “returned to live as a homeless person in the public area of the airport since mid-September, after a stay in a nursing home,” the spokesperson said.
The spokesperson added that Nasseri was an “iconic character” at the airport and that the “whole airport community was attached to him, and our staff looked after him as much as possible during many years, even if we would have preferred him to find a real shelter.”
While Nasseri’s story inside the airport was memorialized by Tom Hanks in the movie “The Terminal”, the spokesperson for the airport noted that: “The Spielberg film suggests that he was stuck in a transit zone at Paris-Charles de Gaulle. In reality, he spent several stays there, but always in the public area of the airport, he was always free to move around.”
How some people can end up living at airports for months -- even years -- at a time
At one point French authorities offered to allow him to reside in France, but Nasseri turned down the offer, reportedly because he wanted to get to his original destination, England.

What to know about control of Congress and outstanding votes in other races
By Eric Bradner and Maeve Reston, CNN
Published 12:33 AM EST, Sun November 13, 2022
Tabulators work to process ballots at the Maricopa County Tabulation and Election Center in Phoenix, on Saturday, November 12, 2022.

CNN
 — 
The battle for control of the House is now the biggest unanswered question of this year’s midterm elections after Democrats kept their narrow Senate majority.
Victories in Arizona and Nevada, according to CNN projections, mean the party will enter 2023 with at least 50 Senate seats – and could add one more if Sen. Raphael Warnock defeats Republican challenger Herschel Walker in a Georgia runoff next month.
But there are other key races for other offices that are still outstanding.
Which party reaches the 218 seats necessary for a House majority will hinge on races in states with a large share of mail-in ballots – including California, where identifying winners in some races could take weeks, Oregon and Arizona.
Another high-profile contest remains too close to call: The Arizona governor’s race – where Republican Kari Lake, the Donald Trump-supported election denier, is facing Democratic secretary of state Katie Hobbs, a defender of the state’s election process.
A Democratic upset keeps House majority hopes alive
The political world’s eyes are now on the battle for control of the House, where Republicans appear to be slowly inching toward a narrow majority but Democrats’ hopes have not yet fully faded.
Republicans have won 211 of the 218 seats they’d need to take the majority, according to CNN projections, while Democrats have won 204, with 20 undecided as of Saturday evening.
Analysis: How Joe Biden and the Democratic Party defied midterm history
Democrats scored a major coup in Washington’s Republican-leaning 3rd District, where on Saturday CNN projected that Democrat Marie Gluesenkamp Perez would defeat Republican Joe Kent, who had aligned himself closely with former President Donald Trump.
Her victory came largely as a result of Trump’s efforts to punish Republicans who voted to impeach him. Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler, a moderate who was widely viewed as a lock for reelection, did not finish in one of the top two slots in the primary and therefore didn’t advance to the general election.
Many of the undecided races are in California, where counting mail-in ballots can take weeks and significant shifts can occur late in that process. Other states with large quantities of mail-in ballots, including Arizona and Oregon, also have undecided races.
Regardless of the ultimate makeup of both chambers next year, Republicans’ lackluster midterm performance has prompted a backlash against House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy.
Senate win also boosts Biden’s power
In retaining their Senate majority, Democrats defied the historical trend of midterm elections breaking against parties in power and overcame anxiety about high inflation. Instead, voters punished Republicans who had opposed abortion rights and parroted Trump’s lies about election fraud.
The outcome is a huge boost to President Joe Biden over the remaining two years of his first term in the White House. It means Democrats will have the ability to confirm Biden’s judicial nominees – avoiding scenarios such as the one former President Barack Obama faced in 2016, when then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell refused to hold a vote on his Supreme Court nominee, Merrick Garland. It also means that Senate Democrats can reject bills passed by the House and can set their own agenda.
Democrats will keep control of the Senate, CNN projects
Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer took a victory lap late Saturday night, saying that voters had vindicated Democrats’ agenda.
He said the Democratic Senate candidates “beat some very flawed challengers who had no faith in democracy, no fidelity to truth or honor. And even when the polls looked bleak, our candidates never gave up and never lost faith.”
He also touted Democrats’ ability to block any GOP measures that would ban abortion rights in the wake of the Supreme Court’s June decision to reverse Roe v. Wade.
“Because the American people turned out to elect Democrats in the Senate, there’s now a firewall against a nationwide abortion ban threat that so many Republicans have talked about,” he said.
Another Georgia Senate runoff
Senate control already being settled will take some of the national spotlight – and the television advertising spending – away from the Senate runoff in Georgia.
But the December 6 race between Warnock and Walker is still important. A win would give Democrats a meaningful majority, rather than the power-sharing agreement currently in place with Vice President Kamala Harris serving as a tie-breaker in the 50-50 chamber. It would also give them a pad ahead of a 2024 Senate battle in which the party must defend several seats in states that typically back Republican presidential candidates.
“It’s just simply better. The bigger the number the better,” Biden, who is in the midst of an international trip, told reporters in Cambodia shortly after CNN and other news outlets projected Democrats would keep their Senate majority.
How the Georgia Senate runoff will work
Warnock’s campaign had already launched a television advertisement laying out the stakes for the runoff.
“It’s about who has the competence and character to represent us; who’s willing to tell the truth; who has the knowledge needed for the job,” a narrator says in the spot.
It’s the second straight election in which overtime in Georgia, which is triggered when no candidate tops 50% of the vote in the general election, will be necessary.
In 2021, Democrats swept two Georgia Senate runoffs – Jon Ossoff’s race against then-Sen. David Perdue and Raphael Warnock’s match-up with then-Sen. Kelly Loeffler. Loeffler had been appointed to the Senate in 2019 when former Sen. Johnny Isakson resigned for health reasons. Warnock defeated her in the special election for the remainder of Isakson’s term.
Now, Warnock faces Walker, the former University of Georgia football star backed by Trump, in a race for a full six-year term.
Arizona governor among key races still undecided
The Arizona governor’s race between Lake, one of the most prominent election deniers on the ballot this year, and Hobbs, remains tight, with Hobbs clinging to a 34,000 vote lead as of late Saturday with an estimated 290,000 votes to be counted.
If she wins, Lake would be a rare Trump-supported election denier to win a competitive statewide race this year. Other Republicans who had parroted Trump’s falsehoods about widespread election frauds lost governor’s races in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin and secretary of state races in Arizona, Michigan, Nevada, and more.
In an interview with CNN Saturday afternoon, Maricopa County Board of Supervisors Chairman Bill Gates said that about 190,000 votes remain to be counted in Maricopa County.
He said he was confident that about 95% to 99% of those votes will be recorded by Tuesday. He said the county will continue to report about 85,000 votes per night until they are done.
It’s perhaps the most closely watched race that’s too close to call. But several other key races are also undecided.
In Alaska, the state’s at-large House seat and one of its Senate seats will hinge on ranked-choice results. Democratic Rep. Mary Peltola, who won a special election this summer, is in a strong position to eclipse the 50% mark. But Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski faces a stiffer challenge from Republican Kelly Tshibaka, who is backed by Trump as part of his bid for retribution against Murkowski and others who for his impeachment after the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol.
And in Los Angeles, Rep. Karen Bass on Saturday widened her lead over developer Rick Caruso in the mayor’s race.
Election officials push back on disinformation
Officials in Arizona and Nevada continued to push back on election misinformation about the vote counting that was spread online by right-wing activists and by Trump on his Truth Social platform. Trump baselessly posted on Truth Social Friday night that Clark County, which is the most populous in Nevada, was “finding all sorts of ballots in Clark County” and “pulling out all stops to steal the Election from Adam Laxalt.”
Clark County Registrar of Voters Joe Gloria refuted Trump’s claim during a news conference on Saturday. In Nevada, ballots postmarked on Election Day could be counted as long as they arrived by Saturday.
“We’re taking ballots in that we’re required to take in according to the law, there’s no way that we can find ballots,” Gloria said. “They’re brought here by the United States Postal Service. As long as it’s postmarked [by Election Day], we process those ballots and put them in the count.”
Laxalt struck a different tone than Trump Saturday. Shortly before the Saturday evening ballot drop from Clark County, Laxalt was leading Cortez Masto by a mere 862 votes.
Still, Laxalt acknowledged in a tweet Saturday morning that the mail-in ballots that had arrived over the past couple of days continued to break in higher Democratic margins than his team had calculated. “This has narrowed our victory window,” he tweeted. He said the race was coming down to the more than 20,000 Election Day Clark County drop-off ballots. “If they are GOP precincts or slightly DEM leaning then we can still win. If they continue to trend heavy DEM then she will overtake us.”
Underscoring the closeness of the race, Laxalt put out a series of tweets Saturday evening encouraging voters to “cure” their ballots to ensure that any ballots with technical errors with signature or other issues could be fixed to ensure they are counted. The deadline to cure ballots is 5 p.m. on Monday.
In Arizona, where CNN has projected that Sen. Mark Kelly will win reelection, GOP Senate nominee Blake Masters took a different approach – tweeting Saturday that all the votes should be counted before anyone predicts the outcome (even though Kelly continued to lead him by a significant margin).
“For my people who knocked doors in 115 degree heat, and for the million+ Arizonans who put their faith in me, we are going to make sure that every legal vote is counted,” Masters tweeted. “If, at the end, Senator Kelly has more of them than I do, then I will congratulate him on a hard-fought victory. But voters decide, not the media; let’s count the votes.”
Maricopa County Election officials pushed back on Masters’ earlier contention – one that Lake had also made – that the vote counting in Arizona was moving too slowly in Arizona’s most populous county.
“It’s really, really unfortunate that some candidates, some activists are deciding to spread this misinformation,” Gates told CNN’s Jim Acosta. “We have spent weeks at Maricopa County, getting that word out that people should not anticipate results on election night or even the next day. That it does take this long.”
Gates added that candidates and activists who were stating that the count was taking too long have not been “paying attention to the history of how we have counted votes here in Arizona for decades now. The average time over the last couple of decades to get through our count is 10 to 12 days.”

Video: CNN projects Democrats will keep control of Senate03:05
Nov. 12, 2022 US election coverage
By Adrienne Vogt, Matt Meyer, Melissa Macaya and Veronica Rocha, CNN
Updated 8:34 a.m. ET, November 13, 2022
What we covered here
Democrats keep control of Senate: Democrats will maintain their narrow Senate majority, CNN projects, after victories in close contests in Nevada and Arizona.
Meanwhile in Georgia: The state's Senate contest is headed to a Dec. 6 runoff, and a Democratic victory there would broaden the party's majority in the chamber.
Where things stand in House races: Republicans appear to be inching closer to the 218 seats that would deliver them a House majority, but several congressional races — including in California and Colorado — remain uncalled.

CNN Projection: Democrats will keep control of the Senate

Democrats will keep their narrow Senate majority for the next two years, CNN projects, after victories in close contests in Nevada and Arizona. Democrats now have 50 Senate seats to Republicans’ 49 seats. 
In Nevada, CNN projects that Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, a former prosecutor and state attorney general, will defeat Republican Adam Laxalt, her successor in the attorney general’s office and the son and grandson of former senators. 
In Arizona, CNN projects that Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly, a former astronaut and the husband of former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, will defeat Republican Blake Masters, a venture capitalist who was endorsed by Trump and supported by tech mogul and emerging GOP megadonor Peter Thiel. 
Georgia’s race between Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock and Republican challenger Herschel Walker is headed to a December runoff after neither candidate cleared the 50% threshold on Tuesday. 
Even if Republicans win the Georgia runoff, though, Vice President Kamala Harris would continue to cast the tie-breaking vote in an evenly divided Senate to guarantee the Democratic majority. 
Only one Senate seat has changed hands so far in the 2022 midterm elections: Pennsylvania, where Democratic Lt. Gov. John Fetterman, who campaigned as he recovered from a May stroke, defeated Republican Mehmet Oz, the celebrity doctor who was endorsed by former President Donald Trump. 
Republicans successfully defended seats in hard-fought races in Florida, North Carolina, Ohio and Wisconsin, while Democrats retained their seats in competitive contests in Arizona, Colorado, Nevada and New Hampshire. 
More on the Democrats’ Senate win: Retaining Senate control is a huge boost to President Biden over the remaining two years of his first term in the White House. 
It means Democrats will have the ability to confirm Biden’s judicial nominees — avoiding scenarios such as the one former President Barack Obama faced in 2016, when then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell refused to hold a vote on his Supreme Court nominee, Merrick Garland. It also means that Senate Democrats can reject bills passed by the House and can set their own agenda.

CNN Projection: Nevada's Cortez Masto will win reelection, allowing Democrats to hold the Senate 
From CNN’s Maeve Reston

Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto will win reelection in Nevada, CNN projects, clinching a critical victory that will allow Democrats to keep control of the US Senate. 
Cortez Masto had long been viewed as one of the most vulnerable Democratic incumbents as she fended off a challenge from former Nevada Attorney General Adam Laxalt in a state whose economy had been hard hit by the Covid-19 pandemic and inflation. 
With Cortez Masto — the first Latina senator — securing a second term, Democrats will hold 50 seats and Republicans will hold 49. Democrats are also defending a seat in Georgia, where Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock and Republican Herschel Walker are headed to a December 6 runoff. Even if Republicans pick up that seat, Vice President Kamala Harris will still hold the tie-breaking vote, as she does now in the evenly divided chamber. Democrats were able to hold the majority, in part, because they picked up a seat in Pennsylvania, where Lt. Gov. John Fetterman, a Democrat, defeated Trump-backed Mehmet Oz in the contest to replace retiring Republican Sen. Pat Toomey. 
Control of the US House still hangs in the balance and may not be determined for some time with ballots left to be counted in closely contested races in California, as well as other states.

Key Nevada county expected to release results from its remaining 22,000 ballots soon

Clark County, Nevada, will release results from its remaining 22,000 mail ballots tonight, according to county registrar Joe Gloria.
This batch of results will be released “sometime this afternoon or early evening,” he said earlier today.
Why these votes are key: Clark County is home to Las Vegas and is the largest county in Nevada. Results from the vote-rich county could be pivotal in deciding Nevada’s razor-thin race for US Senate between Republican Adam Laxalt and incumbent Democrat Catherine Cortez Masto, which is still uncalled. 
An additional 268 ballots arrived in the mail today, which is the last day ballots can arrive. Only ballots that were postmarked by Election Day will count. 
In addition, there are 7,139 mail ballots that could still be “cured,” Gloria said at a press conference Saturday. That means there was an issue with the ballot — such as a missing signature – that a voter can fix to have their vote counted. Not all of these 7,139 ballots will get “cured,” meaning they won’t all ultimately get counted. 
There are also still 5,555 provisional ballots that need to be adjudicated and potentially counted, Gloria said. Provisional ballots are used when there is an issue at an in-person polling place, like if it’s unclear whether someone is registered or if they show up at the wrong precinct. The county examines the provisional ballots and verifies that the voter was eligible – so some, but not all, of these 5,555 ballots will count.

Analysis: Why it takes longer to count West Coast votes
Analysis by Zachary B. Wolf

What’s taking so long to determine which party has control of the US House and Senate? Blame California, Nevada, Washington and the whole vote-by-mail West Coast, really.
Actually, don’t blame them. This is just how elections work in 2022.
Blame an evenly divided electorate: If elections weren’t so close, it wouldn’t take so long to figure out who won.
CNN has still not projected who will control either the House or the Senate in large part because of close races on the West Coast.
Read this more detailed report on the latest state of play from CNN’s Jeremy Herb.
Probably worth the wait: The benefit of knowing who won on Election Day is arguably outweighed by allowing more people access to the vote and the cost savings of not having to staff so many polling places.
Bill Gates, the chairman of the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors, told CNN’s Sara Sidner on Thursday why it takes longer to count mail-in ballots and those placed in ballot drop boxes in the days immediately prior to and on Election Day. Maricopa is Arizona’s most populous county that includes Phoenix.
“This is how we run elections in Arizona,” Gates told Sidner. “If people don’t like that, they can go to the legislature and have them pass new laws.”
It’s a process that’s been in place in Maricopa County since the 1990s, he said. It’s also overseen by both Republican and Democratic Party officials.
Verifying signatures: With election officials visible, busily working behind him at the Maricopa County Tabulation and Election Center, Gates said those mail-in ballots that were dropped off right before and on Tuesday don’t even start the important process of signature verification until the Wednesday after Election Day.
“We have experts here who go through, compare the signature on the outside of the ballot envelope with the signature that we have in our voter registration file,” Gates said. “That takes a while because we got to get that right.”
Most states have some sort of signature verification system for their absentee and mail-in ballots, according to a tally from the National Conference of State Legislatures.

Where things stand in the Arizona governor's race as new vote counts come in

An estimated 290,000 votes are yet to be counted in Arizona, and the governor's race is still on the line.
The vast majority of these votes are in Maricopa County, CNN political director David Chalian explains.
Republican candidate Kari Lake needs in the range of 55 to 57% of that outstanding vote, Chalian said.
Watch him break down the numbers:

CNN Projection: Democrat Marie Gluesenkamp Perez will defeat Republican Joe Kent in Washington's 3rd District
From CNN staff
(From Marie Gluesenkamp Perez)
Marie Gluesenkamp Perez will be the first Latino Democrat elected to Congress from Washington state, CNN projects, winning election to the state’s 3rd Congressional District.
Gluesenkamp Perez, an auto repair shop owner whose father immigrated to the US from Mexico, will defeat Republican Joe Kent to succeed GOP Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler, who finished behind Gluesenkamp Perez and Kent in the August top-two primary.
Gluesenkamp Perez’s defeat of Kent is a significant victory for Democrats in a race that had been rated Lean Republican by Inside Elections with Nathan L. Gonzales. 
Democrats had long targeted this seat, but GOP Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler had proven a strong incumbent. Her vote to impeachment Donald Trump after the US Capitol riot, however, made her a target of the former president. When she failed to advance to the general election in Washington’s top-two system, she became one of four Republicans who voted to impeached Trump who failed to make it to the general election — and the 3rd District became an open seat.
Kent, a former Green Beret and gold star spouse endorsed by Trump, had tried to shift his campaign rhetoric toward the center – including by removing calls to adjudicate the 2020 election from his website sometime between June and July. But as CNN KFile has reported, his campaign had been bogged down by associations with white nationalists and extremists, whom Kent has repeatedly had to distance himself from.

Arizona's Pima County will post about 20,000 votes by 8 p.m. ET
From CNN's Sam Fossum
Pima County, Arizona, will post 19,944 newly counted votes on Saturday night by 8 p.m. ET, county officials said.
These officials added that the votes being released tonight are primarily mail ballots that were received or dropped off prior to Election Day. 
Pima County is a Democratic stronghold and is home to Tucson.
There are just under 50,000 votes left to be processed in the county and this remaining vote is primarily mail ballots that were dropped off on Election Day, according to the officials.
The county will not be posting any vote totals on Sunday and will not be holding a news conference, although they will continue to process ballots and tabulate results. After Saturday night's post, the next vote dump and news conference will be on Monday. 
The county has also completed verifying early ballots and will begin work on processing the remaining 2,400 provisional ballots.
8:22 p.m. ET, November 12, 2022
Here's what to watch for when more election results are released in key races tonight
The political world's attention is on the western US Saturday as officials work through another day to tally the votes in key races.
The razor-thin elections for Nevada’s Senate seat and Arizona’s governorship have yet to be called. Large counties in both states are working to whittle down the tens of thousands of ballots that still need to be counted.
Races we're watching
In Nevada: Republican Adam Laxalt is holding onto a slim lead of about 860 votes over Democratic incumbent Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto.
If Cortez Masto wins, Democrats are projected to take control of the Senate. If she loses, the fate of the upper house will be decided in December's Georgia runoff.
In Arizona: Democrat Katie Hobbs leads Republican Kari Lake by about 31,000 votes in the governor’s race.
It's been a fiery campaign marked by Lake's unfounded claims about the 2020 election and Hobbs' role as the Arizona secretary of state.
Where we expect results this evening
In both states taking center stage tonight, large counties will release a significant number of results.
Clark County, Nevada: Clark County, which is Nevada's most populous and encompasses Las Vegas, will release results from its remaining 22,000 mail ballots tonight, according to county registrar Joe Gloria.
This batch of results will be released “sometime this afternoon or early evening,” he said, and he estimated that this could happen around 7 p.m. ET at the earliest. 
Washoe County, Nevada: Washoe County plans to release its next batch of results on Saturday night around 11 p.m. ET, according to election officials.
There are approximately 12,000 ballots remaining to be counted there, officials said, though it’s unknown how many will be in Saturday night’s batch of results.
Washoe County, which encompasses Reno, is Nevada's second-largest by population and is considered a swing county.
Maricopa County, Arizona: More results are expected around 10 p.m. ET Saturday from Maricopa County, which is the most populous in Arizona.
Elections supervisor Bill Gates told CNN he expects a vote drop similar to last night, when the county reported about 80,000 more votes.
Gates said Friday that there are about 275,000 ballots left to count in the county, which includes Phoenix.
5:51 p.m. ET, November 12, 2022
Maricopa County rebuts election disinformation in Tweet thread
From CNN's Sam Fossum
In a series of tweets Saturday, Maricopa County, Arizona, officials pushed back against election disinformation and baseless fraud claims as they continued to count the vote in Arizona. 
""VOTERS: All legal votes will be counted. Your vote will count equally whether it is reported first, last, or somewhere in between. Thank you for participating,"" wrote the Maricopa County Twitter account.
The message continued: ""CANDIDATES: All legal votes will be counted, including votes for you. If you have the most votes in the final tally, you will be elected. If you do not have the most votes, you will have lost your election.""
They also addressed people spreading misinformation, writing: ""DISINFORMATION SUPER SPREADERS: Please read Arizona election law & the elections procedures manual before asking leading questions about how something seems suspicious. There are processes + checks and balances in place to make sure every legal vote is only counted once.""
The account adds, wryly: ""SOCIAL MEDIA BOTS: Your disapproval is duly noted but your upvotes and retweets will not be part of this year’s totals. This is not meant as an affront to your robot overlords, it’s just not allowed for in Arizona law."" 
Some background: On Friday night, the Republican National Committee and the Republican Party of Arizona tweeted a statement criticizing the vote-counting process as too slow in Maricopa County.
Arizona GOP gubernatorial nominee Kari Lake baselessly claimed Thursday that election officials were intentionally delaying results to make her look worse. And former President Donald Trump has claimed, without proof, that county officials are rigging the vote in favor of Democrats.
The county's top election official, a Republican, has repeatedly pushed back on those claims.
""It's really, really unfortunate that some candidates, some activists are deciding to spread this misinformation,” the chairman of the county's Board of Supervisors, Bill Gates, told CNN's Jim Acosta. “We have spent weeks at Maricopa County, getting that word out that people should not anticipate results on election night or even the next day. That it does take this long.""

My son has been asking for a dress. I finally decided to just get him dresses despite being afraid he’d get teased by other kids. Today, the boy next door asked why he was wearing a dress, I said “he wanted one” and he said “okay” then they continued to play. The kids are alright

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez says she feels in danger in current political environment

 — 
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said that she “absolutely” has felt her life is in danger since joining Congress, with her head always “on a swivel” when she’s in public amid the nation’s charged political environment.
“It is a very real dynamic and very unfortunately and tragically we’ve seen political violence play out,” the New York Democrat told CNN’s Chris Wallace on “Who’s Talking to Chris Wallace?”
The New York Democrat said the deluge of threats against her means “when I wake up in the morning, I hesitate to walk my dog. It means when I come home, I have to ask my fiancé to come out to where my car is to walk me just from my car to my front door.”
“It means that there’s just – a general disposition where you kind of feel like there’s almost a static electricity around you,” she said.

More on the midterms
The recent attack on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s husband has touched off fresh concern about violence against lawmakers and their families. Federal law enforcement agencies have consistently warned about the increasing threat of politically motivated violence after January 6, 2021, raising specific concerns about the likelihood that online calls for violence result in real-world attacks.
Ocasio-Cortez’s progressive credentials have made her the ire of many congressional Republicans and their supporters. She told The New York Times this fall that her office struggles to keep up with “astronomical” amount of threats she receives each day.
Such an environment, Ocasio-Cortez told CNN, has influenced her approach to her work, pushing her to be “as robust and urgent as possible.”
“I don’t want to take the time I have for granted. I don’t know if I’m going to be there to see us achieve guaranteed health care in the United States. So I need to advocate it in a very fully throated way right now,” she said.
“Similar to a full path to citizenship for millions of people in this country. I just have to be out and say it and at least leave a roadmap should I not be there.”
Asked about the future of Democratic leadership in Congress, Ocasio-Cortez, speaking broadly, said, “I do believe we need to have not just generational shifts, but potentially substantive shifts as well.”
“I think that and I hope that what we’ve seen, whether people think it’s too left or too right, or up or down or whatever, it may be that we shift in a direction where the leadership of the Democratic Party is less reliant on large and corporate donors and sponsorship, because that does have a shaping effect of our legislative priorities,” she said.

Lagos, Nigeria
""Wakanda Forever,"" the sequel to ""Black Panther,"" Marvel Studios' award-winning $1.3 billion grossing movie, had its African premiere in Nigeria -- the first time Marvel has held an African premiere there.
Attending the event in Lagos, on Sunday, November 6, the film's director, Ryan Coogler, and several leading actors spoke to CNN about the importance of celebrating the film in Africa's most populous country, and how they hope the continued exploration of different cultures and history will impact global audiences.
The film follows the death in 2020 of Chadwick Boseman, who played King T'Challa -- the Black Panther -- in the original movie, released in 2018.
'Black Panther: Wakanda Forever' pulls off a difficult dive after Chadwick Boseman's death
With the introduction of new anti-hero Namor, the king of underwater kingdom Talokan, who breaches Wakanda's defenses while the country is still grieving the loss of T'Challa, ""Wakanda Forever"" presents another mythical and powerful nation, -- this time with roots in Mayan culture.
Coogler, who also co-wrote the script, said that introducing another rich heritage was on the cards when he started developing the idea of the sequel in 2018. ""We wanted to ramp it up by making it more culturally specific, more detailed, more personal. And even after Chadwick passed away, we stayed the course. I was speaking with him before he passed and he was excited about the direction that the film was going in,"" said Coogler.
""Our diversity is our strength""
The 2018 film was one of the highest grossing films in Africa, with audiences responding favorably to the kingdom of Wakanda, which represented an amalgam of African countries and cultures and an ideology of an Africa many would like to see.
Lupita Nyong'o, the Kenyan-Mexican actress who plays Wakandan spy Nakia, told CNN she hopes global audiences will connect with the diversity showcased in the movie. ""There is power in a diverse human experience,"" she said. ""I think it's always good to be able to relate to people who do not look like you and to see your humanity in them. Our diversity is our strength as human beings.""

Nyong'o and her co-star, Zimbabwean-American actress and writer Danai Gurira, attended the Black Panther premiere in South Africa in 2018, and to them, having more of the cast come to the continent they call home is significant. ""There's always a comfort coming back to the continent. We are very different around Africa, but there's also a through line there,"" said Nyong'o. ""There's just something that feels more familiar, more accessible and I love that.""
The film's score and soundtrack also celebrates the cultures championed in the movie, featuring a mix of Latin American and African artists such as Grammy-winning Nigerian artist Burna Boy, Ghana's Amaarae, UK artist Stormzy, whose mother is Ghanaian, and Grammy-nominated Nigerian singer-songwriter Tems, who co-wrote the lead single ""Lift me up,"" sung by Rihanna. The soundtrack was recorded in Nigeria, Mexico and London.
How 'The Woman King' created a warm and epic Dahomey Kingdom for the big screen
Gurira, who reprises her role as General Okoye, the leader of the Dora Milaje, Wakanda's all-female army, said of the premiere: ""This feels like massive progress that so many of us are here this time. I'm very excited to be here and I think it is different from being in the US or in the West because the story is so rooted in the continent that the idea of it being celebrated here in a big way is only right.""
Also in attendance were actors Winston Duke, who plays M'baku, leader of the Jabari Tribe, Letitia Wright, who plays tech-whiz Princess Shuri, and Tenoch Huerta as Namor. The premiere was one of the opening films at the African International Film Festival (AFRIFF), which runs until 12 November.
""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" is released in theaters worldwide on November 11.

Disneyland adds dolls in wheelchairs to 'It's a Small World' ride
Natasha Chen, CNN • Updated 11th November 2022
Facebook
Twitter
Email
Anaheim, California (CNN) — For the first time in Disneyland's 67-year history, there are now characters in wheelchairs represented on an attraction.
On Friday morning, two dolls in wheelchairs were unveiled on the theme park's ""It's a Small World"" ride, a project that took more than half a year and involved both Disney creatives and the park's accessibility team.
The change was part of an ongoing effort of looking at the resort ""with a magnifying glass"" for opportunities for inclusion, said Kim Irvine, executive creative director of Walt Disney Imagineering for Disneyland Resort.
Jill Houghton, president and CEO of Disability:IN, a nonprofit that works on business disability inclusion, called the new dolls ""a fantastic addition.""
""The dolls are participating inclusively alongside their non-disabled peers, which is something we want to see more of, instead of being depicted as limited or incapable because of a disability,"" Houghton said in a statement to CNN.
She noted that the Americans with Disabilities Act was passed in 1990, ""but nothing in this law compels businesses to increase representation.
""Disney clearly sees the benefits of attracting a wider audience that is inclusive to everyone. We need to see more of this in pop culture, theme parks and entertainment if we want to be truly representative of the largest minority group in the world,"" Houghton said.
The ""It's a Small World"" attraction, designed by Disney artist Mary Blair, opened in 1966 in Anaheim, California, after it was presented at the 1964-65 World's Fair in New York.
The same ride was added to other Disney parks around the world, where guests board a boat and sail through multiple countries, featuring more than 300 Audio-Animatronics figures representing children from around the world.
Irvine said the new additions fit into the spirit of the original attraction.
""What a wonderful story that Walt and Mary Blair, and the original Imagineers, put together about the children of the world and our unity all under one bright sun -- and how we really should rejoice together in that.""
The dolls that are now in wheelchairs were originally standing. Irvine said the same characters with the same clothing were recreated in a seated position, in wheelchairs designed to match the Mary Blair style.
One doll is located in the ride's South America scene, and the other appears in the final scene where dolls from many countries sing together.
Adding 'meaningful things'
The attraction at Disneyland reopened on Friday after a brief closure for the addition of these dolls and the installation of holiday décor for the ""It's a Small World Holiday"" edition of the ride that will run through early January.
While the holiday décor is seasonal, the dolls in wheelchairs are a permanent addition.
Dolls with wheelchairs are also expected to be added to ""It's a Small World"" in Walt Disney World and Disneyland Paris sometime next year.
But because each resort's version of the ride has a different layout and different sets, those new dolls and wheelchairs will be designed with the specific version of the ride in mind.
""I think that is definitely something that the original Imagineers would embrace and think was wonderful that we were looking at things like this,"" Irvine said.
""We are always looking to enhance our attractions with not just fun things, but meaningful things as well. And keeping timely with what's happening in the world, and especially, you know, making things new.
""I know we never want our attractions to become so predictable that you could ride them with your eyes closed and know what's going on in there. We like to constantly be surprising you with new things and important things, especially relevant things.""
The new dolls were the result of a more than six-month collaboration.
Disneyland Resort/Christian Thom
Erin Quintanilla, manager of accessibility for the Disneyland Resort, said this was a historic moment.
""I feel seen. I feel represented. It's a monumental moment to have my community be in an attraction and represented,"" said Quintanilla, who uses a wheelchair. ""I teared up when I saw them in the attraction.""
Quintanilla said her team had been approached by Disneyland creatives who wanted to add these dolls. Her accessibility team made sure the look was authentic, down to the angle of the dolls' feet on the wheelchair footplates.
""We wanted to make sure that it was a person in a wheelchair who was independently moving through life. So we didn't want the wheelchair to feel like a hospital style wheelchair. You'll notice in the design, it's beautifully created to align with a Mary Blair style,"" said Quintanilla.
""But there are details of the wheelchair like having a push rim so that the doll would be able to move through the story in a way that I move through the world. So it's pretty special to have those details be accurate,"" Quintanilla said.
Other changes from Disney
New dolls have not been added to the Disneyland version of this ride since 2009.
At that time, a ""Spirit of America"" room was added, including three Native American dolls and characters from the movie ""Toy Story.""
More dolls of specific Disney characters were added throughout the attraction.
As part of overall efforts to improve inclusion and diversity in its theme parks, Disney recently announced changing the Splash Mountain attraction, which is based on characters from ""Song of the South,"" into a theme inspired by ""The Princess and the Frog,"" featuring Disney's first Black princess.

Dolly Parton receives $100 million Courage and Civility Award from Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez

 — 
Dolly Parton is the latest recipient of the Bezos Courage and Civility Award.
“Jeff [Bezos] and I are so proud to share that we have a new Bezos Courage and Civility Award winner — a woman who gives with her heart and leads with love and compassion in every aspect of her work,” Bezos’ longtime partner, Lauren Sanchez, posted on Instagram alongside a video of their speech Friday before awarding the grant to the country music legend and longtime philanthropist.
“We can’t wait to see all the good that you’re going to do with this $100 million award, @DollyParton.”
Parton, who has donated to various causes for decades, publicly thanked Bezos and Sanchez on Twitter.
“I try to put my money where my heart is. I will do my best to do good things with this money,” Parton tweeted. “Thank you @JeffBezos #LaurenSanchez”
During the Covid-19 pandemic, Parton donated $1 million to Vanderbilt University Medical Center’s vaccine research efforts. It was partly used to fund Moderna’s Covid-19 vaccine.
She said in an interview at the time with BBC’s “The One Show,” that she felt “honored and proud.”
“I just felt so proud to have been part of that little seed money that will hopefully grow into something great and help to heal this world,” she said. “I’m a very proud girl today to know I had anything at all to do with something that’s going to help us through this crazy pandemic.”
In 1988, Parton established the Dollywood Foundation, and eventually The Imagination Library, a program that helps children across the world access books.
Among her philanthropic efforts in her home state of Tennessee, Parton also created the Dolly Parton Scholarship, which provides $15,000 to recipients towards a college education.
Last year, Bezos awarded $100 million each to CNN contributor Van Jones and chef José Andrés.
Bezos, the founder and former head of Amazon.com, said at a news conference at the time the grant had no strings attached.
“They can give it all to their own charity,” Bezos said last year. “Or they can share the wealth. It is up to them.”

Two plus-size models say they were denied entry to a Los Angeles lounge and ‘no one wants to stand up for you’
By Jalen Brown and Justin Gamble, CNN
Published 4:02 AM EST, Sun November 13, 2022
Ella Halikas and Alexa Jay said they were denied entry to a popular lounge in Los Angeles last week.
Ella Halikas/Alexa Jay
CNN
 — 
Two models in Los Angeles are urging other curvy women to speak out on size discrimination after saying they were denied entry to a popular lounge because of their bodies.
Alexa Jay and Ella Halikas, who first shared their story on TikTok, said they went to The Highlight Room last week to celebrate a friend’s birthday. Jay said she first spotted Halikas, a friend and fellow plus-size model, while standing in line with others who were also invited to the party and as their group got closer to the entrance, the women say everyone was allowed in—except them.
The bouncer looked them up and down and told them, “not tonight,” Jay said, adding that she felt embarrassed and humiliated that she went home.
“To get ready and get dressed up and feel so vulnerable that a man is now objectifying you at the door to see if you’re worth of coming in and having a drink or not, is the worst feeling ever,” Halikas said.
Tao Group Hospitality, the parent company of The Highlight Room, said in a statement it was aware of the incident and are in contact with Jay and Halikas about their experience.
“We are always appreciative of feedback on our operations and continue to work on how to improve our guest experience. Our company does not tolerate discrimination of any kind,” the company said.
The women said they have received a message from The Highlight Room with the general manager’s number attached, and the manager offering to talk with them in person about the incident. But the women said that’s not enough.
Halikas said no one stood up for them after the incident, which she described as “blatant discrimination against our size.”
“In that moment it hurt because we have such a great following online,” said Halikas. “I have almost 600,000 followers on TikTok but the second this happens in real life, everyone is silent. No one wants to stand up for you.”
The models said they decided to share their experience online because this isn’t the first time they have faced prejudice as plus size women.
Shortly after they posted a video on TikTok about the incident, the models’ followers started using the hashtag #NotTonight as a way to “reclaim the phrase” used by the bouncer and spread awareness about size discrimination.
“It doesn’t matter your race, your size, your sexual orientation, if you have acne, if you are pretty, if you are ugly, it does not matter,” Jay said.
Some of their followers shared messages of support and shared their own stories.
“People started commenting on their own and we just ran with it,” Jay said. “It’s not just our story anymore.”

How Joe Biden and the Democratic Party defied midterm history
Analysis by Harry Enten, CNN

CNN
 — 
President Joe Biden and the Democratic Party have pulled off a midterm election for the record books.
Democrats have retained the Senate – doing no worse than holding steady at 50 seats and potentially gaining one – and look likely to keep any net losses in the House in the single digits.
Democrats will keep control of the Senate, CNN projects
Midterms are supposed to be the time for the opposition party to shine. That should especially be the case when there is once-in-a-generation inflation and when the vast majority of Americans think the country is on the wrong track.
Instead, Biden and the Democrats are in a position to have one of the four best midterms for the party controlling the White House in the last century.
So just what happened? It’s pretty clear that general election voters punished Republican candidates they saw as too extreme – on issues such as abortion and/or for being too closely tied to former President Donald Trump.
Still, the election results were extremely unusual. I went back through the record books. Since 1922, there have been three previous instances of the president’s party gaining (or losing no) Senate seats and losing fewer than 10 House seats in the president’s first midterm.
All of them – 1934, 1962 and 2002 – are thought to be monumental achievements for the president’s party and major exceptions to rule, which suggests the party controlling the White House usually loses seats in a midterm.
Analysis: Democrats would have gotten crushed this election without young voters
Democrats’ performance this year has funneled down to the state level as well. We already know, based on projected races, that this will be the first time since 1934 that the president’s party had a net gain of governorships in a president’s first midterm. (1986 is the only other post-1934 midterm, regardless of when it fell in a presidency, when the president’s party had a net gain of governorships, though Ronald Reagan’s GOP had massive losses in the Senate that year.)
The shocking thing about this year (assuming the current trends hold) is that Biden is quite unpopular. His approval rating was 44% in the exit polls. His favorable rating was 41%.
We don’t have any polling from 1934, though considering Franklin Roosevelt won two landslide victories on either end of that midterm, he was likely quite popular.
The polling from 1962 and 2002 shows the presidents at the time (John F. Kennedy and George W. Bush respectively) with approval ratings north of 60%.
GOP’s ‘candidate problem’
The ability for Democrats to defy expectations this year starts simply with whom Republicans nominated for statewide elections. Analysts, myself included, noted that Republicans seemed to have a candidate likability problem. Pre-election polling showed that Republicans in all the key races had negative net favorability ratings. Democrats in pretty much all the key races were better liked than their opponents.
INTERACTIVE:
How 2020 election deniers did in their 2022 midterm races
Many of those Republicans were endorsed by Trump and had said (at least at one point) that they believed he had won the 2020 election. (This, of course, is false, as Biden won the election.)
The exit polls bear out Republicans’ “candidate problem” in the 2022 midterms. In every Senate race (save Georgia) that Inside Elections had rated as a toss-up or only tilting toward a party before the election, more voters said the Republican candidate’s views were too extreme than said the same for the Democratic candidate.
We see this in gubernatorial elections, as well. Republicans nominated 2020 election deniers for governor in a number of blue or swing states. None of them has been projected a winner, and only Republican Kari Lake of Arizona has any chance of winning.
Perhaps the lack of success by these GOP candidates shouldn’t be a surprise given that some 60% of voters – both in pre-election surveys and the exit polls – believe Biden was legitimately elected.
Still, Democrats look to have scored an incredible achievement in the 2022 midterms, especially given how unpopular polls showed Biden was.
The last two Democratic presidents with approval ratings matching Biden’s in their first midterm (Bill Clinton in 1994 and Barack Obama in 2010) saw their party suffer a net loss of more than 50 House seats, at least five Senate seats and at least five governorships.
Two presidents on the trail
Of course, bad Senate or gubernatorial candidates weren’t the only reason Republicans had a disappointing midterm election.
On the national level, there are two presidents in the spotlight: the current one (Biden) and the former one (Trump). Both men sported negative net favorable ratings, per the exit polls.
Some past and current Republican members of Congress blame Trump for party's losses, say time to move on in 2024
The fact that you have a current president and a former president who are both unpopular isn’t unusual. Both Obama and George W. Bush were unpopular before the 2010 midterm.
What is unusual is that of the 18% who viewed neither Biden nor Trump favorably in the exit polls, 40% of them voted for Democrats. The backlash against one president this year may have been canceled out by the backlash against the other.
In 2010, a September CNN poll had Democrats winning just 21% of those who viewed neither Bush nor Obama favorably.
The reason for the difference between 2010 and 2022 is pretty obvious. I had pointed out before the election that Trump was getting more Google search traffic than Biden (i.e. the former president was in the minds of voters). Bush wasn’t receiving anywhere near the search traffic as Obama in 2010, though.
‘Abortion first’ voters
Arguably, what truly made this midterm unique was abortion. Despite high inflation, only 31% of voters in the exit poll said it was the most important issue to their vote. A nearly identical percentage (27%) said abortion, and these voters overwhelmingly chose Democratic candidates for Congress.
Voters deliver ringing endorsement of abortion rights on midterm ballot initiatives across the US
This matches the dynamic we saw in the special House elections following the overturning of Roe v. Wade in June. Democrats started doing considerably better than before the Supreme Court ruling.
And while Republicans somewhat recovered their standing in national House polls in the closing weeks of the campaign, they never made it back to where they were during the spring.
The fact that “abortion first” voters overwhelmingly chose Democrats makes sense given that 60% of exit poll respondents said the procedure should be legal in all or most cases.
When you put it all together, Biden and the Democrats appear to have done something others have tried – and failed – in previous midterms: They turned the election into a choice between two parties instead of the usual referendum on the president’s party.

Fresno woman killed sister and newborn niece over ‘jealousy and sibling rivalry,’ police say
By Melissa Alonso, CNN
Published 10:43 PM EST, Sat November 12, 2022

Fresno Police Department
CNN
 — 
Fresno police in California arrested two people this week for the September killings of 18-year-old Yanelly Solorio-Rivera and her three-week-old daughter, Celine – and Yanelly’s sister is one of the suspects, according to authorities.
The Fresno Police Department arrested 22-year-old Yarelly Solorio-Rivera and her boyfriend, 26-year-old Martin Arroyo-Morales, on Wednesday for the double murder, said FPD Chief Paco Balderrama.
On the morning of September 24, officers responded to a Fresno home “regarding a report of multiple gunshots heard within a bedroom in the house,” according to a news release from police. Officers entered the bedroom where they found the mother and child “suffering from multiple gunshot wounds,” said police.
The young woman was fatally shot in her own bed while holding her newborn daughter, said Balderrama. Both were pronounced dead at the scene.
“The scene was traumatic for all officers” and crime scene personnel involved, Balderrama said.
Police had suspicions about the suspects early in the investigation but detectives didn’t have enough evidence to make an arrest until this week, the chief said.
Last week, police had released video from an exterior camera showing a person walking from the scene, in hopes of obtaining new information.
“Through various investigative efforts, we developed a positive identification on the individual in the video,” Balderrama said.
According to police, the suspects admitted to the killings and told officers where to find the murder weapon.
“We have the murder weapon, a Smith & Wesson 9mm handgun, and we have a motive – jealousy and sibling rivalry,” said the chief.
The suspects were transported to Fresno County Jail, and both were booked for two counts of murder. It is unclear whether the suspects have legal representation.
“Although arrests have been made in this case, detectives are asking anyone with information to contact the Fresno Police Department,” said police.

My son has been asking for a dress. I finally decided to just get him dresses despite being afraid he’d get teased by other kids. Today, the boy next door asked why he was wearing a dress, I said “he wanted one” and he said “okay” then they continued to play. The kids are alright

California authorities search for missing woman after ‘significant amount of blood’ was found in her home
By Sharif Paget, Melissa Alonso and Rebekah Riess, CNN
Published 2:26 AM EST, Sun November 13, 2022
The Simi Valley Police Department in California is searching for 25-year-old Rachel Castillo.

CNN
 — 
Authorities in California are searching for a 25-year-old woman believed to be “at risk” after a “significant amount of blood” was found in her home, according to police.
Officers with the Simi Valley Police Department responded to a call of suspicious circumstances at the residence of Rachel Castillo Thursday night, a news release from the department said.
Upon further investigation, Castillo’s whereabouts remain unknown, police said.
Rachel’s mother, Robyn Castillo, told CNN that Rachel’s sister, Emily Castillo, found the blood at the home Thursday evening.
“She entered the home, saw the blood and then called me and then called 911,” Robyn Castillo said. “So, I quickly rushed over, and we both entered the home again.”
Emily had searched the property for Rachel before her mother and the police arrived, but was unable to find her, Robyn said. She and her daughter then left the home to avoid contaminating the scene.
Rachel Castillo has two sons, ages five and two.
Castillo Family
Robyn described her daughter as a “really great mom to her sons, a good daughter, a good sister, and a good friend.”
Rachel’s two sons, ages 5 and 2, had been picked up from the home earlier that morning by their father, Robyn said.
“We’re hoping that somebody has some information and that they’ll come forward so that we can bring her back home to her family and her sons,” she added. “It’s been very difficult, we’re just taking it day by day and moment by moment and helping police as much as we can.”
Rachel is studying to become a marriage and family therapist, her mother said. She added that Rachel loves to help people and get them the resources they need.
Police described Rachel as 5’2” tall, weighing 105 pounds, with brown hair and eyes.
Anyone with information regarding her whereabouts is asked to contact the Simi Valley Police Department.

Dave Chappelle talks Kanye, antisemitism and Trump in ‘SNL’ monologue

 — 
Dave Chappelle addressed several contentious topics in his latest “Saturday Night Live” monologue, focusing mostly on Kanye West’s recent antisemitic comments.
In a lengthy stand-up set, Chappelle name-checked former President Donald Trump and Senate candidate Herschel Walker – and also may have alluded to the negative reaction to jokes he’s made about transgender people.
Before he began his routine, he unfolded a small piece of paper and read from it: “‘I denounce antisemitism in all its forms. And I stand with my friends in the Jewish community.’ And that, Kanye, is how you buy yourself some time.”
Dave Chappelle hosts 'SNL' tonight. Here's a timeline of controversies surrounding his jokes about transgender people
On the topic of West, Chappelle said he typically approached the rapper when West was embroiled in a controversy – but this time, Chappelle said, he waited to observe the response to West’s antisemitic statements. Chappelle also joked that “Kanye got in so much trouble, Kyrie got in trouble,” referencing the NBA star suspended by the Brooklyn Nets for comments after sharing a link to an antisemitic movie on social media.
Chappelle said he could see how West would “adopt the delusion that the Jews run show business,” saying it’s “not a crazy thing to think – but it’s a crazy thing to say out loud in a climate like this.”
He went on: “I know the Jewish people have been through terrible things all over the world, but you can’t blame that on Black Americans. You just can’t.”
In an apparent nod to the backlash some comics receive when audiences find their jokes offensive, Chappelle ended the monologue by admitting to the audience he no longer enjoyed performing in front of large crowds, saying “it shouldn’t be this scary to talk about anything, it makes my job incredibly difficult.”
“I hope they don’t take anything away from me,” he said. “Whoever they are.”
Chappelle has made explicit jokes about trans women’s bodies and misgendered trans people in several stand-up specials released in the last few years. Criticism of his comments quickly mounted in 2021 following the release of his multi-million dollar Netflix special, “The Closer,” offending LGBTQ advocates and leading some Netflix employees to protest the company and call for the special to be removed.
Netflix stood by the special, which was later nominated for two Emmys. Chappelle addressed the criticism on tour shortly after the release of his special, telling his audience he was willing to talk with trans critics but was not “bending to anybody’s demands.”

US Customs and Border Protection commissioner resigns
By Priscilla Alvarez, CNN
Updated 10:06 PM EST, Sat November 12, 2022
Chris Magnus poses for a photograph during an interview in his office with The Associated Press on February 8, 2022, in Washington.

CNN
 — 
President Joe Biden has accepted the resignation of US Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Christopher Magnus, the White House said Saturday.
Biden thanked Magnus for “nearly forty years of service,” according to a statement from White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, and added that he “wishes him well.”
Magnus had been asked to resign by Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas this week, according to two sources familiar with the matter. He submitted his resignation to Biden on Saturday, which is effective immediately.
Magnus has been criticized internally for being out of touch with the agency and publicly for the handling of the US-Mexico border. During his tenure, officials have told CNN they believed Magnus seemed disengaged and wasn’t joining some internal meetings at a critical time for the agency.
The resignation comes after Magnus had said in a statement to the Los Angeles Times on Friday that he planned to stay at the agency.
“I am excited about the progress I made and look forward continuing that work,” he said.
CBP Deputy Commissioner Troy Miller will serve as the acting commissioner beginning immediately, according to an email from Mayorkas to CBP employees on Saturday, obtained by CNN.
CNN has reached out to the Department of Homeland Security and the White House for comment.
President Joe Biden tapped Magnus, who served as police chief in Tucson, Arizona, to helm CBP – the largest federal law enforcement agency and the second-largest revenue-collecting source in the federal government.
Late last year, the Senate confirmed Magnus after months of confirmation setbacks that left the agency with a void at the top amid a record number of border arrests.
Magnus came in at a time when Customs and Border Protection, which is under the Department of Homeland Security, faced an influx of migrants crossing the US-Mexico border and grappled with travel restrictions stemming from the coronavirus pandemic.
US Border Patrol, a division of Customs and Border Protection, made over 2.2 million arrests in fiscal year 2022 for unlawful crossings on the US-Mexico border, the highest annual number of apprehensions on record.
This story has been updated with additional developments.

I think North Carolina is a pretty city. I want to paint such a wonderful city on my canvas. Because my former hobby is painting. I haven't painted in many years. Painting always calms me down and makes me stare. Amen

Lagos, Nigeria
""Wakanda Forever,"" the sequel to ""Black Panther,"" Marvel Studios' award-winning $1.3 billion grossing movie, had its African premiere in Nigeria -- the first time Marvel has held an African premiere there.
Attending the event in Lagos, on Sunday, November 6, the film's director, Ryan Coogler, and several leading actors spoke to CNN about the importance of celebrating the film in Africa's most populous country, and how they hope the continued exploration of different cultures and history will impact global audiences.
The film follows the death in 2020 of Chadwick Boseman, who played King T'Challa -- the Black Panther -- in the original movie, released in 2018.
'Black Panther: Wakanda Forever' pulls off a difficult dive after Chadwick Boseman's death
With the introduction of new anti-hero Namor, the king of underwater kingdom Talokan, who breaches Wakanda's defenses while the country is still grieving the loss of T'Challa, ""Wakanda Forever"" presents another mythical and powerful nation, -- this time with roots in Mayan culture.
Coogler, who also co-wrote the script, said that introducing another rich heritage was on the cards when he started developing the idea of the sequel in 2018. ""We wanted to ramp it up by making it more culturally specific, more detailed, more personal. And even after Chadwick passed away, we stayed the course. I was speaking with him before he passed and he was excited about the direction that the film was going in,"" said Coogler.
""Our diversity is our strength""
The 2018 film was one of the highest grossing films in Africa, with audiences responding favorably to the kingdom of Wakanda, which represented an amalgam of African countries and cultures and an ideology of an Africa many would like to see.
Lupita Nyong'o, the Kenyan-Mexican actress who plays Wakandan spy Nakia, told CNN she hopes global audiences will connect with the diversity showcased in the movie. ""There is power in a diverse human experience,"" she said. ""I think it's always good to be able to relate to people who do not look like you and to see your humanity in them. Our diversity is our strength as human beings.""

Nyong'o and her co-star, Zimbabwean-American actress and writer Danai Gurira, attended the Black Panther premiere in South Africa in 2018, and to them, having more of the cast come to the continent they call home is significant. ""There's always a comfort coming back to the continent. We are very different around Africa, but there's also a through line there,"" said Nyong'o. ""There's just something that feels more familiar, more accessible and I love that.""
The film's score and soundtrack also celebrates the cultures championed in the movie, featuring a mix of Latin American and African artists such as Grammy-winning Nigerian artist Burna Boy, Ghana's Amaarae, UK artist Stormzy, whose mother is Ghanaian, and Grammy-nominated Nigerian singer-songwriter Tems, who co-wrote the lead single ""Lift me up,"" sung by Rihanna. The soundtrack was recorded in Nigeria, Mexico and London.
How 'The Woman King' created a warm and epic Dahomey Kingdom for the big screen
Gurira, who reprises her role as General Okoye, the leader of the Dora Milaje, Wakanda's all-female army, said of the premiere: ""This feels like massive progress that so many of us are here this time. I'm very excited to be here and I think it is different from being in the US or in the West because the story is so rooted in the continent that the idea of it being celebrated here in a big way is only right.""
Also in attendance were actors Winston Duke, who plays M'baku, leader of the Jabari Tribe, Letitia Wright, who plays tech-whiz Princess Shuri, and Tenoch Huerta as Namor. The premiere was one of the opening films at the African International Film Festival (AFRIFF), which runs until 12 November.
""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" is released in theaters worldwide on November 11.

10,000 brains in a basement: The dark and mysterious origins of Denmark’s psychiatric brain collection
By Samantha Bresnahan, Dr. Sanjay Gupta, Susanne Gargiulo and Sandy Thin, CNN
Updated 6:45 AM EST, Fri November 11, 2022
Editor’s Note: Watch the special documentary, “World’s Untold Stories: The Brain Collectors,” November 12-13 on CNN International.
CNN
 — 
For years, there had been whispers. Rumors swirled; stories exchanged. It wasn’t a secret, but it also wasn’t openly discussed, adding to a legend almost too incredible to believe.
Yet those who knew the truth wanted it out.
Tell everyone our story, they said, about the brains in the basement.
A family secret
As a child, Lise Søgaard remembers whispers, too, though these were different – the family secret kind, hushed because it was too painful to speak it out loud.
Søgaard knew little about it, except that these whispers centered on a family member who seemed to exist solely in one photograph on the wall of her grandparent’s house in Denmark.
The little girl in the picture was named Kirsten. She was the younger sister of Søgaard’s grandmother, Inger – that much she knew.
“I remember looking at this girl and thinking, ‘Who is she?’ ‘What happened?’” Søgaard said. “But also this feeling of a little bit of a horror story there.”
As she grew into adulthood, Søgaard continued to wonder. One day in 2020, she went to visit her grandmother, now in her mid-90s and living at a care home in Haderslev, Denmark. After all that time, she finally asked about Kirsten. Almost as if Inger had been waiting for that very question, the floodgates opened, and out poured a story Søgaard never expected.

Lise Søgaard
Kirsten Abildtrup was born on May 24, 1927, the youngest of five brothers and her sister, Inger. As a child, Inger remembers Kirsten as quiet and smart, the two sisters sharing a close bond. Then, when Kirsten was around 14 years old, something began to change.
Kirsten experienced outbursts and prolonged bouts of crying. Inger asked her mother if it was her fault, often feeling that way because the two girls were so close.
“At Christmas, they were supposed to go on a visit to some family members,” Søgaard said, “but my great-grandmother and father, they stayed home and sent all of their children away except for Kirsten.”
When they got back from that family visit, Søgaard said, Kirsten was gone.
It was the first of many hospitalizations, and the start of a long and painful journey that would ultimately end in Kirsten’s death.
The diagnosis: schizophrenia.
The brain collectors
Kirsten was first hospitalized towards the end of World War II, when Denmark and the rest of Europe were at last on the verge of peace.
Like so many places, Denmark was also grappling with mental illness. Psychiatric institutions had been built across the country to provide care for patients.

But there was limited understanding of what was happening in the brain. The same year peace came to Denmark’s doorstep, two doctors working in the country had an idea.
When these patients died in psychiatric hospitals, autopsies were routinely performed. What if, these doctors thought, the brains were removed – and kept?
Thomas Erslev, historian of medical science and research consultant at Aarhus University, estimates that half of all psychiatric patients in Denmark who died between 1945 and 1982 contributed – unknowingly and without consent – their brains. They went to what became known as the Institute of Brain Pathology, connected to the Risskov Psychiatric Hospital in Aarhus, Denmark.
Doctors Erik Stromgren and Larus Einarson were the architects. After roughly five years, said Erslev, pathologist Knud Aage Lorentzen took over the institute, and spent the next three decades building the collection.
Dr. Larus Einarson, shown here teaching a class, was one of the co-founders of the brain collection at the Institute of Brain Pathology.

The final tally would amount to 9,479 human brains – believed to be the largest collection of its kind anywhere in the world.
Nearly 10,000 brains on the move
In 2018, pathologist Dr. Martin Wirenfeldt Nielsen got a call. The brain collection, as it would come to be known, was on the move.
A lack of funding meant it could no longer stay in Aarhus, but the University of Southern Denmark in the city of Odense had offered to pick up the mantle. Would Wirenfeldt Nielsen be interested in overseeing it?

“I’d sort of heard of it in the periphery,” Wirenfeldt Nielsen recalled. “But my first real knowledge about the vast extent of it was when they decided to move it down here … (because) how do you actually move almost 10,000 brains?”
The yellowish-green plastic buckets housing each brain, preserved in formaldehyde, were placed into new white buckets that were sturdier for the transport, and hand-labeled in black marker with a number. And then the brains, give or take a few (no one knows where bucket #1 is, for example) made their way to their new home in a large basement room on the university’s campus.
“The room wasn’t actually ready when they moved it down here,” Wirenfeldt Nielsen said. “The whole collection was just standing there, buckets on top of each other, in the middle of the floor. And that’s when I saw it for the first time … That was like, okay, this is something I’ve never seen before.”
An ethical reckoning
Eventually, the nearly 10,000 buckets were placed on rolling shelves, where they remain today – waiting – representing lives, and a range of psychiatric disorders.
There are roughly 5,500 brains with dementia; 1,400 with schizophrenia; 400 with bi-polar disorder; 300 with depression, and more.
What separates this collection from any other in the world is that the brains collected during the first decade are untouched by modern medicines – a time capsule of sorts, for mental illness in the brain.
“Whereas other brain collections … (are) maybe specified for neurodegenerative diseases, dementia, tumors, or other things like that – we really have the whole thing here,” Wirenfeldt Nielsen said.
But it has not been without controversy. In the 1990s, the Danish public got wind of the collection, which had been sitting idle since former director Lorentzen’s retirement in 1982.
It would kick off one of the first major ethical science debates in Denmark.

“There was a discussion back and forth, and one position was that we should destroy the collection – either bury the brains or get rid of them in any other ethical way,” said Knud Kristensen, the director of SIND, the Danish national association for mental health, from 2009 to 2021, and current member of Denmark’s Ethical Council. “The other position said, okay, we already did harm once. Then the least we can do to those patients and their relatives is to make sure that the brains are used in research.”
After years of intense debate, SIND changed its position. “All of a sudden, they were very strong proponents for keeping the brains,” Erslev said, “actually saying this might be a very valuable resource, not only for the scientists, but for the sufferers of psychiatric illness because it might prove to benefit therapeutics down the line.”
“For (SIND),” Kristensen said, “It was important where it was placed and to make sure that there would be some sort of control of the future use of the collection.”
By the time it moved to Odense in 2018, the ethical debate was largely settled, and Wirenfeldt Nielsen became caretaker of the collection.
A few years later, he would get a message from Søgaard. Was it possible, she asked, that he had a brain there belonging to a woman named Kirsten?
Searching for Kirsten
In the search for what happened to her great aunt Kirsten, Søgaard realized there were clues all around her. But piecing together what exactly had happened to her grandmother’s sister was slow, filled with dead ends and false starts.
Yet she was enthralled, and began officially reporting her journey for Kristeligt Dagblad, the Copenhagen-based newspaper where she worked – eventually bringing it to light in a series of articles.
At one point, Søgaard decided to focus on a single word her grandmother had told her, the name of a psychiatric hospital: Oringe.
“I opened my computer and I searched for ‘Oringe patient journals,’” she said. After putting in a request through the national archives, “I got an email that said, ‘Okay, we found something for you, come have a look if you want.’ … I felt this excitement … like, she’s out there.”
Journalist Lise Søgaard made it her mission to find out what happened to her grandmother's little sister, Kirsten -- a journey that would take her places she never imagined. She shared that experience with CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta at her home outside Copenhagen in April 2022.
Cameron Bauer and Samantha Bresnahan/CNN
That excitement was short-lived. At the national archives, they placed a mostly empty file in front of her. It wasn’t much to go on, but it confirmed Kirsten’s diagnosis of schizophrenia.
Without another solid lead, Søgaard wondered where to go next. Then, almost in passing, as they looked through old family photos together, her mother said something that she’d never heard before.
“She said, ‘You know, they might have kept her brain,’ and I said, ‘What?!’” Søgaard told CNN’s Dr. Sanjay Gupta at her house outside of Copenhagen. “And she told me what she knew about the brain collection.”
Living with schizophrenia
At age 95, Søgaard’s grandmother, Inger, could still clearly picture visiting her little sister Kirsten in the hospital, after the symptoms she first started experiencing at age 14 continued to progress.
Upon one visit, Inger remembered, “(Kirsten) was lying there, completely apathetic. She was not able to speak to us. … Another day we went to visit her, and she was gone from her room. They told us she had thrown a glass at a nurse, and they had sent her to the basement, to a room where they (restrained) her with belts. And we were not allowed to go in, but I saw her through a hole in the door; she was lying there, strapped up.”
One floor of the Oringe psychiatric hospital is now a museum, which displays medical treatments and patient rooms such as this one.
Samantha Bresnahan/CNN
Inger felt confused and scared, she said, because it could have been anyone, including her, that might get “sick.”
At Sankt Hans, one of the largest and oldest psychiatric hospitals in Denmark, Dr. Thomas Werge walks the same grounds he did as a child, when his own grandmother was hospitalized there. Now, he runs the Institute for Biological Psychiatry there, where he and his team study the biological causes that contribute to psychiatric disorders.
A 2012 study found that roughly 40% of Danish women and 30% of Danish men had received treatment for a mental health disorder in their lifetimes – though Werge estimated that number would “almost certainly” be higher if the same study was done today. (By comparison, that same year, less than 15% of US adults received mental health services.) Among the other Nordic countries, including Sweden and Norway, Werge said the numbers would be comparable to Denmark’s, as there are “similar [universal] health care systems and standards for admission.”
“Mental (health) disorders are all over,” he added. “We just do not recognize this when we walk around among people. Not everybody carries their pain on the outside.”
For schizophrenia, there are no blood tests or biomarkers to signify its presence; instead, doctors must rely only on a clinical exam.
Schizophrenia presents itself in what the World Health Organization (WHO) calls “significant impairments in the way reality is perceived,” causing psychosis that can include delusions, hallucinations, disorganized behavior or thoughts, and extreme agitation.
Roughly one in 300 people are affected by schizophrenia worldwide, according to the WHO, but less than one-third of those will ever receive specialist mental health care.

The standard treatment since the mid-1950s has been anti-psychotic drugs, which typically work by manipulating dopamine levels: the brain’s reward system. But, Werge said, it can come with a cost.
“Schizophrenia and psychosis are linked to creativity,” he said. “So, when you try to inhibit the psychosis, you also inhibit the creativity. So, there’s a price for being medicated … Whatever causes all these problems for humans is also what makes us humans in the good sense.”
Brain #738
Though there haven’t been many significant scientific breakthroughs regarding an understanding of the disease, researchers have confirmed that genetics and heritability play a significant role.
According to Werge, the heritability estimate is as high as 80% – the same as height. “It’s not a surprise to people that if you have very tall parents … there’s a lot of genetics in that,” he said. “The genetic component is equally large in most of the mental disorders actually.”
Those inherited genetic factors either come from the parents, he added, or can arise in a child even if the parents don’t carry the gene.
Søgaard, who has two young children, said the genetic connection was not a driving motivator in her mission to find out what happened to Kirsten, but she has thought about what it means for herself and her family.
When families reach out about possible relatives in the brain collection, “that’s an ethical dilemma that we need to take into consideration,” Wirenfeldt Nielsen said. In Søgaard’s case, she received approval for the Danish National Archives to check the set of black books that contain the names of every person whose brain is in the collection.
There on the list was Kirsten’s name.
“I got an email back [from the National Archives], and they scanned the page where Kirsten’s name was, and her birthday, and the day they received the brain. And in the column out to the left, there was a number,” Søgaard remembered. “Number 738.” She immediately wrote an email to Wirenfeldt Nielsen, asking if that number corresponded to the bucket with Kirsten’s brain.
“I said, ‘Yes, that’s it,’” Wirenfeldt Nielsen recalled. But he also said he couldn’t be sure the bucket was there because a few are missing for unknown reasons. He ventured down to the basement storage room to verify it was there.
On one of the rolling shelves sat bucket #738.

When Søgaard first saw it, she felt compelled to hug the bucket.
“I had learned a lot about Kirsten,” she said. “I feel some kind of connection … (and) I know the pain that she felt, and I know what she went through.”
The ‘white cut’
What Kirsten went through was another extraordinary beat in this incredible story, and the long history of psychiatric care in Denmark.
As part of her treatment, Kirsten received what’s known commonly in Denmark as “the white cut.”
In medical terms: a lobotomy.
The procedure was an integral part of the country’s psychiatric history. During the time the brain collection was running from the 1940s until the early 1980s, Denmark reportedly did more lobotomies per capita than any other country in the world.

“It’s a very poor treatment, because you destroy a big part of the brain,” Wirenfeldt Nielsen said. “And it’s very risky, because you can kill the patient, basically – but they had nothing else to do.”
Treatment options were limited, and in many ways extreme. Seizures were induced by placing electrodes on either side of the head; insulin shock therapy meant patients were administered large doses of insulin, reducing blood sugar and resulting in a comatose state; and the lobotomy, either transorbital – using a pick-like instrument inserted through the back of the eye to the front lobe – or prefrontal.
The prefrontal lobotomy was pioneered by a Portuguese neurologist, Antonio Egas Moniz. Now considered barbaric, he actually won the Nobel Prize for the procedure in 1949.
A tool is inserted into the frontal lobe, scraping away tracts of white matter – the reason behind the “white cut” moniker. “Emotional reactions … are located at least in part in the frontal lobe,” explained Wirenfeldt Nielsen, “so they thought that just by cutting (there), that could sort of calm the patient down.”

In Kirsten’s case, Inger said there were glimpses of “the old Kirsten” before she got the white cut – but after that, she was gone. In 1951, the year after her lobotomy, Kirsten died.
She was just 24 years old.
A promise for the future
On a metal table in a small, standalone building on the grounds of Oringe psychiatric hospital, Kirsten’s brain was removed, set into a small plastic bucket, placed in a wooden box, and shipped – by regular mail carrier – to the Institute of Brain Pathology at Risskov, to join the brain collection.
Søgaard saw the metal table, where a white wooden block still sits on one end – where the heads were placed – and upon which small marks are still visible today. This is where the skulls were opened.

Despite the graphic reminders, in reporting out this story both for herself, and for the newspaper, “it was important (for me) to not write a story that was a horror story,” she said, adding it was easy to look back and say, “How could you do that?”
“I don’t think the doctors wanted to do bad. I think they actually wanted to do good. … I think the most ethical thing you can do is to make sure that you know exactly what you can do with these brains. And that’s what they’re doing now. They’re trying to find out, ‘How can they help us?’”
There have been studies using the collection over the years, including a discovery in 1970 of what is now known as familial Danish dementia, and a new study is ongoing, focused on mRNA in the brains, by Danish researcher Betina Elfving.
For the most part, the brains represent untapped, enormous potential. Yet the one in bucket #738 has already done something extraordinary, thanks in large part to Søgaard herself. She worked to break the cycle of stigma surrounding mental health disorders by sharing her most personal, intimate family details with the world.
“(My grandmother) expressed gratitude,” Søgaard said. “She also said, ‘I feel like I’m moving closer to my sister now.’”

 — 
Dolly Parton is the latest recipient of the Bezos Courage and Civility Award.
“Jeff [Bezos] and I are so proud to share that we have a new Bezos Courage and Civility Award winner — a woman who gives with her heart and leads with love and compassion in every aspect of her work,” Bezos’ longtime partner, Lauren Sanchez, posted on Instagram alongside a video of their speech Friday before awarding the grant to the country music legend and longtime philanthropist.
“We can’t wait to see all the good that you’re going to do with this $100 million award, @DollyParton.”
Parton, who has donated to various causes for decades, publicly thanked Bezos and Sanchez on Twitter.
“I try to put my money where my heart is. I will do my best to do good things with this money,” Parton tweeted. “Thank you @JeffBezos #LaurenSanchez”
During the Covid-19 pandemic, Parton donated $1 million to Vanderbilt University Medical Center’s vaccine research efforts. It was partly used to fund Moderna’s Covid-19 vaccine.
She said in an interview at the time with BBC’s “The One Show,” that she felt “honored and proud.”
“I just felt so proud to have been part of that little seed money that will hopefully grow into something great and help to heal this world,” she said. “I’m a very proud girl today to know I had anything at all to do with something that’s going to help us through this crazy pandemic.”
In 1988, Parton established the Dollywood Foundation, and eventually The Imagination Library, a program that helps children across the world access books.
Among her philanthropic efforts in her home state of Tennessee, Parton also created the Dolly Parton Scholarship, which provides $15,000 to recipients towards a college education.
Last year, Bezos awarded $100 million each to CNN contributor Van Jones and chef José Andrés.
Bezos, the founder and former head of Amazon.com, said at a news conference at the time the grant had no strings attached.
“They can give it all to their own charity,” Bezos said last year. “Or they can share the wealth. It is up to them.”

Iranian refugee who inspired Spielberg’s film ‘The Terminal’ dies inside Paris airport

 — 
Mehran Karimi Nasseri, the man who had lived inside the Paris-Charles de Gaulle airport for years and inspired Steven Spielberg’s 2004 film “The Terminal”, died Saturday at the same airport.
Nasseri was pronounced dead by the airport medical team at Terminal 2F and had died of natural causes, a spokesperson for the airport told CNN.
Nasseri, an Iranian refugee, was en route to England via Belgium and France in 1988 when he lost his papers and could not board a flight nor leave the airport and was stuck in limbo until 2006.
He had “returned to live as a homeless person in the public area of the airport since mid-September, after a stay in a nursing home,” the spokesperson said.
The spokesperson added that Nasseri was an “iconic character” at the airport and that the “whole airport community was attached to him, and our staff looked after him as much as possible during many years, even if we would have preferred him to find a real shelter.”
While Nasseri’s story inside the airport was memorialized by Tom Hanks in the movie “The Terminal”, the spokesperson for the airport noted that: “The Spielberg film suggests that he was stuck in a transit zone at Paris-Charles de Gaulle. In reality, he spent several stays there, but always in the public area of the airport, he was always free to move around.”
How some people can end up living at airports for months -- even years -- at a time
At one point French authorities offered to allow him to reside in France, but Nasseri turned down the offer, reportedly because he wanted to get to his original destination, England.

Video: CNN projects Democrats will keep control of Senate03:05
Nov. 12, 2022 US election coverage
By Adrienne Vogt, Matt Meyer, Melissa Macaya and Veronica Rocha, CNN
Updated 8:34 a.m. ET, November 13, 2022
What we covered here
Democrats keep control of Senate: Democrats will maintain their narrow Senate majority, CNN projects, after victories in close contests in Nevada and Arizona.
Meanwhile in Georgia: The state's Senate contest is headed to a Dec. 6 runoff, and a Democratic victory there would broaden the party's majority in the chamber.
Where things stand in House races: Republicans appear to be inching closer to the 218 seats that would deliver them a House majority, but several congressional races — including in California and Colorado — remain uncalled.

Democrats will keep their narrow Senate majority for the next two years, CNN projects, after victories in close contests in Nevada and Arizona. Democrats now have 50 Senate seats to Republicans’ 49 seats. 
In Nevada, CNN projects that Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, a former prosecutor and state attorney general, will defeat Republican Adam Laxalt, her successor in the attorney general’s office and the son and grandson of former senators. 
In Arizona, CNN projects that Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly, a former astronaut and the husband of former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, will defeat Republican Blake Masters, a venture capitalist who was endorsed by Trump and supported by tech mogul and emerging GOP megadonor Peter Thiel. 
Georgia’s race between Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock and Republican challenger Herschel Walker is headed to a December runoff after neither candidate cleared the 50% threshold on Tuesday. 
Even if Republicans win the Georgia runoff, though, Vice President Kamala Harris would continue to cast the tie-breaking vote in an evenly divided Senate to guarantee the Democratic majority. 
Only one Senate seat has changed hands so far in the 2022 midterm elections: Pennsylvania, where Democratic Lt. Gov. John Fetterman, who campaigned as he recovered from a May stroke, defeated Republican Mehmet Oz, the celebrity doctor who was endorsed by former President Donald Trump. 
Republicans successfully defended seats in hard-fought races in Florida, North Carolina, Ohio and Wisconsin, while Democrats retained their seats in competitive contests in Arizona, Colorado, Nevada and New Hampshire. 
More on the Democrats’ Senate win: Retaining Senate control is a huge boost to President Biden over the remaining two years of his first term in the White House. 
It means Democrats will have the ability to confirm Biden’s judicial nominees — avoiding scenarios such as the one former President Barack Obama faced in 2016, when then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell refused to hold a vote on his Supreme Court nominee, Merrick Garland. It also means that Senate Democrats can reject bills passed by the House and can set their own agenda.

CNN Projection: Nevada's Cortez Masto will win reelection, allowing Democrats to hold the Senate 
From CNN’s Maeve Reston

Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto will win reelection in Nevada, CNN projects, clinching a critical victory that will allow Democrats to keep control of the US Senate. 
Cortez Masto had long been viewed as one of the most vulnerable Democratic incumbents as she fended off a challenge from former Nevada Attorney General Adam Laxalt in a state whose economy had been hard hit by the Covid-19 pandemic and inflation. 
With Cortez Masto — the first Latina senator — securing a second term, Democrats will hold 50 seats and Republicans will hold 49. Democrats are also defending a seat in Georgia, where Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock and Republican Herschel Walker are headed to a December 6 runoff. Even if Republicans pick up that seat, Vice President Kamala Harris will still hold the tie-breaking vote, as she does now in the evenly divided chamber. Democrats were able to hold the majority, in part, because they picked up a seat in Pennsylvania, where Lt. Gov. John Fetterman, a Democrat, defeated Trump-backed Mehmet Oz in the contest to replace retiring Republican Sen. Pat Toomey. 
Control of the US House still hangs in the balance and may not be determined for some time with ballots left to be counted in closely contested races in California, as well as other states.

Key Nevada county expected to release results from its remaining 22,000 ballots soon

Clark County, Nevada, will release results from its remaining 22,000 mail ballots tonight, according to county registrar Joe Gloria.
This batch of results will be released “sometime this afternoon or early evening,” he said earlier today.
Why these votes are key: Clark County is home to Las Vegas and is the largest county in Nevada. Results from the vote-rich county could be pivotal in deciding Nevada’s razor-thin race for US Senate between Republican Adam Laxalt and incumbent Democrat Catherine Cortez Masto, which is still uncalled. 
An additional 268 ballots arrived in the mail today, which is the last day ballots can arrive. Only ballots that were postmarked by Election Day will count. 
In addition, there are 7,139 mail ballots that could still be “cured,” Gloria said at a press conference Saturday. That means there was an issue with the ballot — such as a missing signature – that a voter can fix to have their vote counted. Not all of these 7,139 ballots will get “cured,” meaning they won’t all ultimately get counted. 
There are also still 5,555 provisional ballots that need to be adjudicated and potentially counted, Gloria said. Provisional ballots are used when there is an issue at an in-person polling place, like if it’s unclear whether someone is registered or if they show up at the wrong precinct. The county examines the provisional ballots and verifies that the voter was eligible – so some, but not all, of these 5,555 ballots will count.

Analysis: Why it takes longer to count West Coast votes
Analysis by Zachary B. Wolf

What’s taking so long to determine which party has control of the US House and Senate? Blame California, Nevada, Washington and the whole vote-by-mail West Coast, really.
Actually, don’t blame them. This is just how elections work in 2022.
Blame an evenly divided electorate: If elections weren’t so close, it wouldn’t take so long to figure out who won.
CNN has still not projected who will control either the House or the Senate in large part because of close races on the West Coast.
Read this more detailed report on the latest state of play from CNN’s Jeremy Herb.
Probably worth the wait: The benefit of knowing who won on Election Day is arguably outweighed by allowing more people access to the vote and the cost savings of not having to staff so many polling places.
Bill Gates, the chairman of the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors, told CNN’s Sara Sidner on Thursday why it takes longer to count mail-in ballots and those placed in ballot drop boxes in the days immediately prior to and on Election Day. Maricopa is Arizona’s most populous county that includes Phoenix.
“This is how we run elections in Arizona,” Gates told Sidner. “If people don’t like that, they can go to the legislature and have them pass new laws.”
It’s a process that’s been in place in Maricopa County since the 1990s, he said. It’s also overseen by both Republican and Democratic Party officials.
Verifying signatures: With election officials visible, busily working behind him at the Maricopa County Tabulation and Election Center, Gates said those mail-in ballots that were dropped off right before and on Tuesday don’t even start the important process of signature verification until the Wednesday after Election Day.
“We have experts here who go through, compare the signature on the outside of the ballot envelope with the signature that we have in our voter registration file,” Gates said. “That takes a while because we got to get that right.”
Most states have some sort of signature verification system for their absentee and mail-in ballots, according to a tally from the National Conference of State Legislatures.

An estimated 290,000 votes are yet to be counted in Arizona, and the governor's race is still on the line.
The vast majority of these votes are in Maricopa County, CNN political director David Chalian explains.
Republican candidate Kari Lake needs in the range of 55 to 57% of that outstanding vote, Chalian said.

CNN Projection: Democrat Marie Gluesenkamp Perez will defeat Republican Joe Kent in Washington's 3rd District
From CNN staff
(From Marie Gluesenkamp Perez)
Marie Gluesenkamp Perez will be the first Latino Democrat elected to Congress from Washington state, CNN projects, winning election to the state’s 3rd Congressional District.
Gluesenkamp Perez, an auto repair shop owner whose father immigrated to the US from Mexico, will defeat Republican Joe Kent to succeed GOP Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler, who finished behind Gluesenkamp Perez and Kent in the August top-two primary.
Gluesenkamp Perez’s defeat of Kent is a significant victory for Democrats in a race that had been rated Lean Republican by Inside Elections with Nathan L. Gonzales. 
Democrats had long targeted this seat, but GOP Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler had proven a strong incumbent. Her vote to impeachment Donald Trump after the US Capitol riot, however, made her a target of the former president. When she failed to advance to the general election in Washington’s top-two system, she became one of four Republicans who voted to impeached Trump who failed to make it to the general election — and the 3rd District became an open seat.
Kent, a former Green Beret and gold star spouse endorsed by Trump, had tried to shift his campaign rhetoric toward the center – including by removing calls to adjudicate the 2020 election from his website sometime between June and July. But as CNN KFile has reported, his campaign had been bogged down by associations with white nationalists and extremists, whom Kent has repeatedly had to distance himself from.

Arizona's Pima County will post about 20,000 votes by 8 p.m. ET
From CNN's Sam Fossum
Pima County, Arizona, will post 19,944 newly counted votes on Saturday night by 8 p.m. ET, county officials said.
These officials added that the votes being released tonight are primarily mail ballots that were received or dropped off prior to Election Day. 
Pima County is a Democratic stronghold and is home to Tucson.
There are just under 50,000 votes left to be processed in the county and this remaining vote is primarily mail ballots that were dropped off on Election Day, according to the officials.
The county will not be posting any vote totals on Sunday and will not be holding a news conference, although they will continue to process ballots and tabulate results. After Saturday night's post, the next vote dump and news conference will be on Monday. 
The county has also completed verifying early ballots and will begin work on processing the remaining 2,400 provisional ballots.
8:22 p.m. ET, November 12, 2022
Here's what to watch for when more election results are released in key races tonight
The political world's attention is on the western US Saturday as officials work through another day to tally the votes in key races.
The razor-thin elections for Nevada’s Senate seat and Arizona’s governorship have yet to be called. Large counties in both states are working to whittle down the tens of thousands of ballots that still need to be counted.
Races we're watching
In Nevada: Republican Adam Laxalt is holding onto a slim lead of about 860 votes over Democratic incumbent Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto.
If Cortez Masto wins, Democrats are projected to take control of the Senate. If she loses, the fate of the upper house will be decided in December's Georgia runoff.
In Arizona: Democrat Katie Hobbs leads Republican Kari Lake by about 31,000 votes in the governor’s race.
It's been a fiery campaign marked by Lake's unfounded claims about the 2020 election and Hobbs' role as the Arizona secretary of state.
Where we expect results this evening
In both states taking center stage tonight, large counties will release a significant number of results.
Clark County, Nevada: Clark County, which is Nevada's most populous and encompasses Las Vegas, will release results from its remaining 22,000 mail ballots tonight, according to county registrar Joe Gloria.
This batch of results will be released “sometime this afternoon or early evening,” he said, and he estimated that this could happen around 7 p.m. ET at the earliest. 
Washoe County, Nevada: Washoe County plans to release its next batch of results on Saturday night around 11 p.m. ET, according to election officials.
There are approximately 12,000 ballots remaining to be counted there, officials said, though it’s unknown how many will be in Saturday night’s batch of results.
Washoe County, which encompasses Reno, is Nevada's second-largest by population and is considered a swing county.
Maricopa County, Arizona: More results are expected around 10 p.m. ET Saturday from Maricopa County, which is the most populous in Arizona.
Elections supervisor Bill Gates told CNN he expects a vote drop similar to last night, when the county reported about 80,000 more votes.
Gates said Friday that there are about 275,000 ballots left to count in the county, which includes Phoenix.
5:51 p.m. ET, November 12, 2022
Maricopa County rebuts election disinformation in Tweet thread
From CNN's Sam Fossum
In a series of tweets Saturday, Maricopa County, Arizona, officials pushed back against election disinformation and baseless fraud claims as they continued to count the vote in Arizona. 
""VOTERS: All legal votes will be counted. Your vote will count equally whether it is reported first, last, or somewhere in between. Thank you for participating,"" wrote the Maricopa County Twitter account.
The message continued: ""CANDIDATES: All legal votes will be counted, including votes for you. If you have the most votes in the final tally, you will be elected. If you do not have the most votes, you will have lost your election.""
They also addressed people spreading misinformation, writing: ""DISINFORMATION SUPER SPREADERS: Please read Arizona election law & the elections procedures manual before asking leading questions about how something seems suspicious. There are processes + checks and balances in place to make sure every legal vote is only counted once.""
The account adds, wryly: ""SOCIAL MEDIA BOTS: Your disapproval is duly noted but your upvotes and retweets will not be part of this year’s totals. This is not meant as an affront to your robot overlords, it’s just not allowed for in Arizona law."" 
Some background: On Friday night, the Republican National Committee and the Republican Party of Arizona tweeted a statement criticizing the vote-counting process as too slow in Maricopa County.
Arizona GOP gubernatorial nominee Kari Lake baselessly claimed Thursday that election officials were intentionally delaying results to make her look worse. And former President Donald Trump has claimed, without proof, that county officials are rigging the vote in favor of Democrats.
The county's top election official, a Republican, has repeatedly pushed back on those claims.
""It's really, really unfortunate that some candidates, some activists are deciding to spread this misinformation,” the chairman of the county's Board of Supervisors, Bill Gates, told CNN's Jim Acosta. “We have spent weeks at Maricopa County, getting that word out that people should not anticipate results on election night or even the next day. That it does take this long.""

No water, power or internet – only euphoria in newly liberated Kherson

Kherson, Ukraine
CNN
 — 
For eight months, residents of the Ukrainian city of Kherson have been living under brutal Russian occupation. But on Friday, Ukrainian forces swept into the city and Russian troops retreated to the east.
The residents have no water, no internet connection and little power. But as a CNN crew entered the city on Saturday, the mood was euphoric.
As the crew filmed live in Kherson’s central square, some in the crowd of locals sang the national anthem while others shouted “Slava Ukrayini!” – glory to Ukraine, a patriotic greeting.
“We feel free, we are not slaves, we are Ukrainians,” resident Olga told CNN.
Locals have also been climbing onto the tops of the buildings, including the cinema, in the square to erect Ukrainian flags. Soldiers driving through are greeted with cheers and asked to sign autographs on flags.
Russia's withdrawal from Kherson is a humiliating setback. Here's what it means for the war
Back when Russian troops rolled in at the beginning of the war, this was a city that tried to resist: people were taken away, tortured, disappeared, residents said.
“We were terrified by [the] Russian army, we were terrified by soldiers that can come any moment in our house, in our home – just open the door, like they are living here, and steal, kidnap, torture,” Olga said.
But now, people flock to the central square in the newly liberated city, wrapped in Ukrainian flags, singing and chanting “Freedom for Ukraine.”
“Everyone here is out celebrating in the square here. People are wearing the Ukrainian flag, they’re hugging the soldiers, they’ve come out to see what it’s like to have freedom,” Robertson said.
Katerina described the liberation as the “best day” of her life after eight months under Russian occupation. “Our town is free, my street is free,” she told CNN.
Another local resident named Andrew said he was so glad to see Ukrainian soldiers.
“I think lots of people were killed here. We just don’t know that yet,” he said of the period under occupation.
A Ukrainian Special Forces soldier, who gave his name only as Daniel, told CNN how his unit was the first to arrive in Kherson. “My commander put the flag on the top of the building,” he said.
“It was a real blast for us, finally. Before the 11th [of November], it was five days of hard work, real hard work. Ukrainian soldiers, as always, just confirmed again that they are stronger than the Russians.”
He added that the civilians in Kherson are the “real heroes” for lasting so long under Russian occupation. “I can’t imagine how happy they are right now,” he said.
The CNN team appeared to be the first international journalists to reach Kherson city center since it changed hands in the past 48 hours.
On Friday, Russia announced it had withdrawn from the west bank of the Dnipro River in the strategic southern region of Kherson, leaving the regional capital of the same name and surrounding areas to the Ukrainians.
The retreat represents a major blow for Putin’s war effort in Ukraine. Kherson was the only Ukrainian regional capital that Russian forces had captured since February’s invasion. Their withdrawal east across the Dnipro cedes large swathes of land that Russia has occupied since the early days of the war, and that Putin had formally declared as Russian territory just five weeks ago.

“It was a really hard time for everyone. Every Ukrainian family waited for our soldiers, for our army,” another Kherson resident told CNN on Saturday, recalling Russia’s months-long occupation.
The woman said it felt “amazing” to see Ukrainian troops in Kherson.
“We felt every day your support, thank you so much,” the woman added, before hugging Robertson.
Efforts to return the city to ‘normal life’
Ukrainian authorities are working to return the city to “normal life,” the head of the regional military administration, Yaroslav Yanushevich, said Saturday in a video message, adding that the city, oblast and district military administrations had arrived in the city and started duties.
“The national police and the security service of Ukraine have also taken up their duties. The State Service for Emergency Situations is clearing mines. We are working for the return of the city to normal life,” Yanushevich said.

About 200 police officers are currently working in the city, Ukraine’s National Police said in a statement Saturday.
“Roadblocks have been set up around and in the territory of Kherson. The regional police continue to record the crimes of the Russian occupiers,” the statement reads.
The main threat is from mines, police said, adding that explosives technicians were working on their detection and disposal. “One of the police sappers was injured today during the demining of an administrative building in Kherson,” police said.
Residents who have left Kherson are advised “not to rush to return until stabilization measures are completed,” police said.
Speaking Saturday on the next steps for the Ukrainian military, CNN military analyst Cedric Leighton said: “This is going to be a major urban operation. What you are going to see is a methodical operation to clear buildings of potential booby traps and mines.
“Another thing that the Ukrainians will have to do is they’re going to have to move their systems forward so that they can counter any possible Russian artillery that is going to be on the eastern bank of the Dnipro River.
“You can see that the Ukrainians have moved to that river bank, they are now controlling that area, they will have to mop up some remaining Russian forces that did not make it out of the west bank of the Dnipro River. But those that are there will probably either surrender or in essence be eliminated from the fight.”
People gathered in Maidan Square to celebrate the liberation of Kherson, in the capital, Kyiv, on Friday.

On Friday evening, Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky posted a nighttime video of celebrations in the city, where a crowd was waving flags and chanting “ZSU,” the Ukrainian acronym for the armed forces.
Earlier that day, the Ukrainian military’s southern operational command said Russian forces had been “urgently loading into boats that seem suitable for crossing and trying to escape” across the river.
It was unclear whether all Russian troops had left Kherson and the wider region. Serhiy Khlan, a member of Ukraine’s Kherson regional council, said the city was “almost under the control of the Armed Forces of Ukraine” but cautioned that some Russian troops might have remained behind in civilian clothing.
He warned that many Russian troops “threw away their military uniforms, and are now hiding with civilian clothes on.”

My son has been asking for a dress. I finally decided to just get him dresses despite being afraid he’d get teased by other kids. Today, the boy next door asked why he was wearing a dress, I said “he wanted one” and he said “okay” then they continued to play. The kids are alright

 — 
Sam Bankman-Fried woke up on Monday still a billionaire, even as his cryptocurrency empire was beginning to unravel. By Friday, his fortune was completely wiped out.
Based on net worth calculations by Bloomberg, Bankman-Fried was worth about $16 billion at the start of the week. But as his crypto exchange, FTX, collapsed, the value of his assets was reduced to zero in what Bloomberg called “one of history’s greatest-ever destructions of wealth.”
Crypto is in chaos as FTX files for bankruptcy
FTX on Friday said it filed for bankruptcy, and Bankman-Fried, known as SBF, resigned as chief executive.
The 30-year-old entrepreneur’s net worth, which was largely tied up in digital assets, peaked at around $26 billion this spring. Over the summer, as crypto prices plummeted, Bankman-Fried emerged as a white knight for the sector, using his FTX exchange and its sister hedge fund, Alameda, to secure lines of credit to crypto companies like BlockFi and Voyager that were at risk of collapsing.
He told Reuters in July that he and FTX still had a “few billion” on hand to shore up other firms and help stabilize the industry.
Bankman-Fried owns about 70% of FTX’s US business, which the index now estimates to be essentially worthless. His stake in online brokerage Robinhood, previously valued at more than $500 million, was removed from Bloomberg’s calculation after news reports said that stake was held through Alameda and may have been used as collateral for loans.
As a follower of “effective altruism,” Bankman-Fried has sought to make as much money as possible in order to give it away. But the fate of his philanthropic endeavors is now in doubt.
On Thursday, the entire staff of the FTX Future Fund, which says it has committed $160 million in grants, publicly quit. In a statement, the five-person team wrote that they “have fundamental questions about the legitimacy and integrity of the business operations that were funding the FTX Foundation and the Future Fund.”

It’s a terrible time to buy a house. Here’s what to know if you have to do it anyway

There is no sugarcoating it: This is a terrible time to buy a home.
Mortgage rates for a 30-year fixed rate loan are now hovering above 7%, more than 4 percentage points higher than a year ago. That has slashed a typical buyer’s purchasing power by 14%, according to Black Knight, a mortgage data company.
With fewer people able or interested in buying now, home sales have been falling. Just 16% of people say now is a good time to buy a home, a record low, according to a monthly survey conducted by Fannie Mae in October.
First-time homebuyers are being shut out of the market like never before
Still, that’s barely made a dent in home prices, which soared to new heights during the pandemic and are now just easing off of all-time highs.
Another thing tamping down sales is stubbornly low inventory of available homes for sale, said Jackie Lafferty, a real estate agent with Baird & Warner Real Estate in Chicago.
“It is something I’ve never seen a combination of, this lack of inventory and higher interest rates,” Lafferty said. “There is no motivation for people to move unless they have to.”
But whether people need to move because of a new job, a divorce, an addition to the family or they simply don’t want to give up after years of trying to buy a home, there are still buyers out there.
“Even if sales slow down, real estate doesn’t stop,” said Lafferty. “People need a place to live.”
For those who are pressing on, here are a few ways you can take some of the sting out of buying a home.
Take a loan now and refinance later
Buyers taking out a mortgage now are doing so with the hope that within a couple years, rates might meaningfully drop and they can refinance to a lower rate.
“Yes, rates have gone up much farther and faster than anyone expected them to,” said Melissa Cohn, regional vice president at William Raveis Mortgage. “But if you can afford to buy today and want and need to, you shouldn’t let the higher rate environment stop you, knowing that at some point in the next year, two years at the most, rates are likely to be significantly lower.”
The downside: You’ll still have to stomach the higher rate for the time being. There is some risk that interest rates may not fall, or at least not by much. And if mortgage rates don’t go down, you could be stuck with it for a while, said Delyse Berry, CEO and principal broker at Upstate Down in Rhinebeck, New York.
“There could be a decrease in rates in the middle of 2023,” she said. “If that comes to pass, you can do a refinance and secure a lower interest rate and lower payments. But these rates could now be the new cost of doing business.”
Plus, refinancing can be extremely costly. Typically, closing costs run between 2% and 5% of the loan’s principal amount.
And unexpected events may prevent you from refinancing, like losing your job or losing value in your home.
Get an adjustable rate loan
More home buyers are exploring options outside of the standard 30-year fixed-rate mortgage. For example, adjustable rate mortgages, or ARMs, now make up 12% of mortgage applications, up from 3% a year ago, according to Mortgage Bankers Association.
While the average rate for a 30-year fixed-rate loan was 7.08% last week, the rate for the 5-year Treasury-indexed hybrid adjustable rate mortgage was a full percentage point lower at 6.06%, according to Freddie Mac. Though they are still 30-year loans, ARMs offer a fixed rate for a set period – typically 5, 7 or 10 years – after which the interest rate resets to current market rates.
“Buying today is about figuring out what can you do to bridge this high-rate environment to get yourself comfortable with your acquisition,” said Cohn. “When rates drop, it is time to see what your more permanent solution will be.”
For buyers who may be moving out of the home in 5 to 7 years anyway, an ARM may be a way to boost purchasing power.
“For the first 5 or 7 years of an adjustable rate mortgage, it walks, talks and acts just like a fixed-rate mortgage,” said Cohn. “It has a lower rate and lower payment because the bank is only guaranteeing it for a shorter period of time.”
If rates come down, an ARM could reset to a better rate.
The downside: Borrowers must also accept the risk that rates could be even higher when the loan resets, or any time over the life of the loan. After the fixed period, ARMs can reset every year or every six months.
However, most do have caps on how much a rate can go up or down during each reset period and over the life of the loan, so it’s important to understand how your loan works.
Buy down your interest rate with points
Borrowers can lower their payments by paying more upfront to buy down their mortgage rate. This will lower the loan’s interest rate, either permanently or temporarily.
While a permanent buydown changes your rate for the life of a loan, a temporary buydown provides lower rates for a period of time.
Think mortgage rates are high now? Homebuyers in the 1980s were paying 19%
In a temporary buydown, typically borrowers get two percentage points off the loan’s rate for the first year, one percentage point off for the second year, and by the third year, the loan returns to its original rate for the remainder of its term. By then, many borrowers expect there to be lower interest rates, which leaves open the possibility of refinancing.
“That is a meaningful difference for the first year of the loan, lowering your rate from 7% to 5%,” said Cohn.
The downside: While getting a lower interest rate is very appealing, it means shelling out more money up front. That might not make financial sense if you don’t plan to stay in the house for a long time.
“It takes about five years to break even on paying down one point,” said Cohn. “Knowing that rates are likely to be meaningfully lower by then, you might be better off taking the money you’d use to pay for points to pay for refinancing later.”
Request a seller’s credit to buy down your rate
In some housing markets, competition among buyers has softened, and sellers are being forced to be more flexible on offers.
One way a buyer can reduce their payments is to ask for a seller’s credit, or a seller’s concession, as part of the deal. Buyers can then use that money to buy down the interest rate on their mortgage and reduce their monthly payments.
“Sellers are willing to negotiate more now than they have in the past,” said Trudy Kelly, a senior home loan specialist at Churchill Mortgage in Oregon.
In September, when mortgage rates were around 5.75%, Kelly worked with borrowers who were buying a $590,000 house. Rather than offering $15,000 or $20,000 below the asking price to reduce the cost of the monthly payments, the buyers asked for a $15,000 seller’s concession.
If the buyers had made the lower offer and got the home for $575,000, their monthly savings would be $78, said Kelly. But by paying down the interest rate by one percentage point, their payments dropped by $340 a month.
“That is a huge difference,” she said. “Ultimately, what that did for them was expand their budget. It lowered their debt-to-income ratio giving them more purchase power. It puts them in a time machine and takes them back to April or May [when rates were lower].”
The downside: In many areas, it’s still a seller’s market. Asking for a credit or concession might be less appealing to a seller if they have other offers.
Buy in cash or increase your down payment
If you’ve got the cash to buy a home, now is a good time to do it. Not only will you avoid paying a high rate on a mortgage, you’ll likely be able to negotiate for a better price.
But not many people can pay in cash: 97% of homebuyers over the past year needed to finance their home, according to a recent report from the National Association of Realtors.
Even if you don’t have enough for an all-cash deal, throwing more at the down payment will reduce the amount of your mortgage, lower your monthly payments, and mean paying less interest over the life of the loan. If you own your current home, you can leverage some of the cash from your sale or possibly even tap the equity to boost your down payment.
By making a larger down payment you will not only reduce your loan balance but also increase your home equity, money you can recoup when you sell – assuming the property appreciates.
The downside: Using cash toward a real estate purchase is always a trade-off, as you’ll have to forgo other potential investments. And for most buyers, coughing up more cash just isn’t an option. The typical down payment for first-time buyers was 6%, while it was 17% for repeat buyers. according to the National Association of Realtors.

Banksy unveils mural in Ukrainian town liberated from Russians
Published 12th November 2022

Sophie Tanno, CNN
Renowned street artist Banksy has unveiled his latest artwork in an Instagram post -- a mural in the liberated Ukrainian town of Borodianka.
The artwork shows a female gymnast balancing on a pile of rubble on the side of a building damaged by Russian strikes.
The graffiti artist posted three images of the piece Friday on social media, with a simple caption reading ""Borodyanka, Ukraine,"" using an alternative spelling for the town's name.
Speculation had been mounting that Banksy was in the war-torn country after a series of murals appeared in Borodianka, located about 35 miles northwest of the capital, Kyiv.

One artwork, not officially claimed by the artist, depicted a man being flipped during a judo match with a little boy.
Another showed two children using a metal tank trap as a seesaw.
Borodianka was hit particularly hard by Russian airstrikes at the start of the invasion of Ukraine in February, with many buildings reduced to piles of rubble by long-range attacks.
It was home to 13,000 people before the war, but most fled after Russia's invasion. What was left of Borodianka, after intense shelling and devastating strikes, was then occupied by Russian forces, who moved in on February 28.

The town came back into Ukrainian control on April 1, and returning residents found their houses ransacked and shops pillaged with windows broken and contents stolen.
The letter ""V"" -- a symbol used by Russia's Eastern Military district in concert with the letter ""Z,"" an emblem for Moscow's so-called ""special military operation"" -- was found painted on buildings, vehicles and checkpoints.
The town has since been the focus of reconstruction efforts, with several tower blocks demolished as a result of damage caused by the fighting.

North Carolina man buys Powerball ticket at Walmart and wins $100,000
By Kelly Murray, CNN
Published 1:15 PM EST, Sat November 12, 2022
Michael Buck, right, won $100,000 on Powerball.
NC Education Lottery
CNN
 — 
A man made a run to Walmart in Rocky Mount, North Carolina, and came home $100,000 richer.
Michael Buck told North Carolina Education Lottery officials that a store employee convinced him to buy a ticket for the record $2.04 billion Powerball drawing.
“The girl at the pharmacy told me they sold Powerball tickets at customer service,” NC Education Lottery quoted the 62-year-old as saying. “I told her, ‘If I win, I’ll come back and buy you a car.’”
Buck matched the numbers on four white balls and the Powerball to win $50,000 on his Power Play ticket, and it doubled to $100,000 with the 2X Power Play multiplier, according to NC Education Lottery.
Buck’s $3 investment in a Quick Pick ticket earned him $71,017 after federal and state taxes.
So you won the lottery. What now?
Buck works as a solutions architect, according to lottery officials. He said he plans to use a large portion of the money to boost his retirement.
Buck told lottery officials he usually only plays when the jackpot goes over $500 million, and he said he didn’t know how to react when he realized he had won.
“I kind of just walked around the house a little bit. I was shaking,” Buck said.
As for the pharmacist’s new car? Buck told lottery officials, “I didn’t hit the jackpot so I can’t buy her a car, but I’ll definitely bring her something.”

Disney plans to freeze hiring and cut jobs, memo shows
by Reuters

How Disney bought the crown jewel of Murdoch's empire
00:40 - Source: CNN
Disney (DIS) is planning to freeze hiring and cut some jobs as it strives to move the Disney (DIS)+ streaming service to profitability against a backdrop of economic uncertainty, according to a memo seen by Reuters on Friday.
Chief Executive Bob Chapek sent the memo to Disney’s leaders, saying the company is instituting a targeted hiring freeze and anticipates “some small staff reductions” as it looks to manage costs.
“While certain macroeconomic factors are out of our control, meeting these goals requires all of us to continue doing our part to manage the things we can control - most notably, our costs,” Chapek wrote in the memo.
The move came after Disney missed Wall Street estimates for quarterly earnings on Tuesday as the entertainment giant racked up more losses from its push into streaming video, which it refers to as its direct-to-consumer (DTC) business. Shares of the company fell more than 13% on Wednesday following its results.
Disney+ beats subscriber expectations but that growth came at a cost
Disney has said the fast-growing service added 12 million subscribers in its fiscal fourth quarter but reported an operating loss of nearly $1.5 billion. The company said Disney+ would become profitable in fiscal 2024, with losses having peaked in the quarter.
The streaming service is known for original series including the “Star Wars” entries “The Mandalorian,” “Andor” and “Obi-Wan Kenobi,” the Marvel entries “WandaVision,” “Hawkeye” and “She-Hulk: Attorney at Law,” and content hubs for Disney, Pixar, Marvel and “Star Wars” films.
Wall Street analysts voiced concern about Disney’s escalating streaming costs. MoffettNathanson analyst Michael Nathanson observed in a note this week that “the company has to prove that their pivot to DTC will be worth the investment price that is currently being paid.”
Corporate America is making deep cuts to its employee base to brace for an economic downturn. Meta said this week it would cut more than 11,000 jobs, or 13% of its workforce to rein in costs.
One of Disney’s studio peers, Warner Bros Discovery, has undergone dramatic cost-cutting efforts, including layoffs, as the recently merged company restructures its content operations.
Chapek said Disney has established a task force, including Chief Financial Officer Christine McCarthy and General Counsel Horacio Gutierrez, to help him make “critical big picture decisions.”
The company already has begun looking at content and marketing spending, but Chapek said the cuts would not sacrifice quality. Hiring will be limited to a small subset of critical positions, and some staff reductions are anticipated as the company looks to make itself more cost-efficient, Chapek wrote.
Chapek said business travel would be limited and trips would require advance approval, or conducted virtually as much as possible.
“Our transformation is designed to ensure we thrive not just today, but well into the future,” Chapek wrote.
The memo was first reported by CNBC.

Playbill leaves Twitter, saying the site ‘expanded tolerance for hate’

Fake Twitter accounts surge after paid verification introduced

CNN
 — 
Playbill, a news outlet and guide for the Broadway theater community and theatergoers, said Friday it left Twitter after Elon Musk took over the platform.
In a statement, Playbill said the social media platform has “greatly expanded its tolerance for hate, negativity, and misinformation.” The account, which had more than 400,000 followers, was not active on Twitter as of Friday.
The company that owns Playbill was established in 1885. It is family-owned.
Twitter briefly rolled out gray 'official' check marks. Then Elon Musk changed his mind
“We feel we can no longer continue to utilize a platform where the line between actual news and insidious rhetoric has become blurred beyond recognition,” Playbill said in a statement.
Hours after Twitter launched its short-lived paid verification system Wednesday, the site faced a barrage of celebrity and company impersonators. The platform suspended numerous fake accounts that had “verified” check marks for brands ranging from Nintendo of America to the software company Valve.
Some of the fake company accounts on Twitter included inappropriate logos or pictures – the imposter Nintendo account, for example, tweeted an image of Mario giving the middle finger.
The following Playbill Twitter accounts are no longer active: @Playbill, @PlaybillTravel, @PLAYBILLder, @PlaybillArts, @PlaybillStore. The company said it would maintain its social media presence on Instagram, Facebook and TikTok.
The company added that that any tweet from a Twitter account that contains the Playbill name is fake.

CNN's slogan is ""CNN: The most trusted name in news."" CNN spread lies about Biden's ""sinking"" approval rating, lied multiple times about a 2022 ""red wave"", lied about Hispanic voters ""turning Republican"", and perpetuated demonstrably false polling data for the past 365+ days.

Vintage military aircraft collide mid-air at Dallas air show

 — 
A Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress and a Bell P-63 Kingcobra collided and crashed at the Wings Over Dallas airshow around 1:20 p.m. on Saturday, according to the Federal Aviation Administration.
Authorities responded to the incident at Dallas Executive Airport, Jason Evans with Dallas Fire-Rescue told CNN on Saturday.
The number of casualties in the crash was still not confirmed later on Saturday afternoon, according to Dallas Mayor Eric Johnson.
However, the Allied Pilots Association, the labor union representing American Airlines pilots, identified two pilot retirees and former union members among those killed in the collision.
Former members Terry Barker and Len Root were among the crew members on the B-17 Flying Fortress during the Wings Over Dallas airshow, the APA said in a tweet. The APA is also offering professional counseling services at their headquarters in Fort Worth following the incident.
“Our hearts go out to their families, friends, and colleagues past and present,” their tweet said.
There were more than 40 fire rescue units on scene after the collision, the agency’s active incidents page shows.
Video captured by bystanders showed the immediate aftermath of the crash.
In a Saturday afternoon news conference, Hank Coates, president and CEO of the Commemorative Air Force, told reporters the B-17 “normally has a crew of four to five. That was what was on the aircraft,” while the P-63 is a “single-piloted fighter type aircraft.”
“I can tell you that it was normally crewed,” Coates said. “I cannot release the number of people in the manifest or the names on the manifest until I’m released to do so by the NTSB.”
The Commemorative Air Force identified both aircraft as being out of Houston.
“Currently we do not have information on the status of the flight crews as emergency responders are working the accident,” a statement from the group said, adding it is working with local authorities and the FAA.
The FAA is currently leading the investigation, which is set to be turned over to the NTSB at approximately 9 p.m. when the NTSB team arrives at the scene, Coates said.
On Saturday evening, the NTSB said it is launching a go-team to investigate the collision. The team is expected to arrive on Sunday, the NTSB said in a tweet.
“Member Michael Graham will serve as spokesperson on scene,” the tweet added.
“The maneuvers that they [the aircraft] were going through were not dynamic at all,” Coates noted. “It was what we call ‘Bombers on Parade’.”
Johnson tweeted later on Saturday no spectators or others on the ground were reported injured, although the debris field from the collision includes the Dallas Executive Airport grounds, Highway 67, and a nearby strip mall.
The event, which was scheduled to run through Sunday, has been canceled, according to the organizer’s website.
Johnson said in a tweet after the crash, “As many of you have now seen, we have had a terrible tragedy in our city today during an airshow. Many details remain unknown or unconfirmed at this time.”
“The videos are heartbreaking. Please, say a prayer for the souls who took to the sky to entertain and educate our families today,” Johnson said in a separate tweet.
Southbound and northbound lanes of the highway were shut down after the incident, the Dallas Police Department said.
“This is not about the aircraft. It’s just not,” Coates said during the news conference. “I can tell you the aircraft are great aircraft, they’re safe. They’re very well-maintained. The pilots are very well-trained. So it’s difficult for me to talk about it, because I know all these people, these are family, and they’re good friends.”
According to Coates, the individuals flying the aircraft in CAF airshows are volunteers and have a strict process of training. Many of them are airline pilots, retired airline pilots, or retired military pilots, Coates said.
Rare vintage aircraft destroyed
The B-17 was part of the collection of the Commemorative Air Force, nicknamed “Texas Raiders,” and had been hangered in Conroe, Texas near Houston. It was one of about 45 complete surviving examples of the model, only nine of which were airworthy.
The P-63 was even rarer. Some 14 examples are known to survive, four of which in the United States were airworthy, including one owned by the Commemorative Air Force.
More than 12,000 B-17s were produced by Boeing, Douglas Aircraft and Lockheed between 1936 and 1945, with nearly 5,000 lost during the war, and most of the rest scrapped by the early 1960s. About 3,300 P-63’s were produced by Bell Aircraft between 1943 and 1945, and were principally used by the Soviet Air Force in World War II.

Georgia man arrested for animal cruelty after 106 dogs bred for fighting were found on his property
By Hannah Sarisohn, CNN

Detectives found 106 dogs in poor conditions at Vincent Lemark Burrell's property.

 — 
A Georgia man has been arrested for animal cruelty and dog fighting after detectives found 106 dogs in poor conditions at his property, officials said.
Vincent Lemark Burrell, 55, was arrested on Tuesday at his home in Paulding County without incident, according to a news release posted on Facebook by the Paulding County Sheriff’s Office.

Burrell bred and trained mostly pit bulls for dog fighting, police said.
Paulding detectives said a lengthy investigation found dogs tied to trees and other objects in the yard. Dogs were also found in the basement of the home, where detectives said the odor and presence of urine and feces were so strong they had to wear protective equipment to safely enter the house, according to the release.
“Conditions where dogs were being housed, both inside and on the exterior of this property, were not fit for humans, much less dogs,” according to the release.

Burrell is currently being held in the Paulding County Jail without bond on felony counts of cruelty to animals and dog fighting, according to the sheriff’s office.
Additional charges against Burrell are expected as the investigation continues, according to the release.
It is unclear whether Burrell has an attorney.
“In cases like these, we have to conduct a lengthy and thorough investigation. This is not something that we can just put together in a few days, cases like these are comprehensive and require us to work with many local, state, and federal entities,” Sheriff Gary Gulledge said in the release.
“I am proud of the teamwork that has been exhibited in this case and I am thankful that these dogs are safe now. The dark and sinister world of dog fighting is a despicable culture that has no place in our world,” the statement continued.
Authorities said the 106 rescued dogs have been placed with various rescue facilities to begin rehabilitation.

Holocaust survivor left on a bench as a baby finds new family at 80
By Lianne Kolirin and Ivana Kottasová, CNN
Updated 3:11 PM EST, Sat November 12, 2022

 — 
When Alice Grusová was a baby, her parents left her on a train station bench, with no idea of what would become of her.
It was June 1942 and this was the last desperate act by Marta and Alexandr Knapp to save their daughter as their attempt to escape what was then Czechoslovakia ended in disaster.
The couple had fled Prague, but when their train drew in to Pardubice, eastern Bohemia, Nazi soldiers boarded in search of fleeing Jews.
Grusová – her married name – never saw her parents again. They were arrested and sent to Theresienstadt concentration camp, from where they were later deported to Auschwitz and murdered. Her brother from her father’s previous marriage was also killed there.
Alice's mother Marta, pictured, was murdered in Auschwitz after she was detained by the Nazis while attempting to flee Czechoslovakia with her family.

It might have been their infant daughter’s fate too, had it not been for their high-stakes gamble. This year, Grusová celebrated her 81st birthday – as well as her 60th wedding anniversary with husband Miroslav. Living in Prague, they have three sons, six grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.
This, she had always felt, was the sum total of her family, but earlier this year the retired pediatric nurse traveled to Israel where she reconnected with her Jewish heritage and met her only surviving first cousin – as well as a wider family she didn’t know existed.
“I was most shocked when I found out, when I was 80, that I have such a large family,” she said in an emotional video call with CNN.
“I am just sad this didn’t come earlier,” added Grusová, who has battled cancer, hepatitis and a spinal surgery.
The reunion occurred thanks to the efforts of a curious woman 5,000 miles away in South Africa, during the initial stages of the pandemic. The incredible story has now been shared by online genealogy site MyHeritage.
With so much of life on hold, Michalya Schonwald Moss delved into her family history on MyHeritage. She had always known her family had been decimated in the Holocaust, but nothing prepared her for the discovery that 120 of her relatives were murdered at Auschwitz.
Yet out of the unimaginable darkness, a tiny and most unexpected ray of hope emerged. With the help of professional genealogists in both Slovakia and Israel, she unearthed the incredible tale of one survivor: Grusová.

Having been found on the station bench, the one-year-old girl was initially placed in an orphanage. Grusová, who has no memory of her parents, was later moved to Theresienstadt. She recalled: “There was a nice woman who was taking care of us. I only remember glimpses from that time.
“And then I remember when I got sick with typhoid and the workers there had to protect me from the Germans.
“I remember they were telling me to be silent or the bad Germans would come and kill us.”
Incredibly, she survived and after the war was reunited with her mother’s younger sister Edith – or Editka as she calls her – who survived Auschwitz by being transferred to a labor camp.

Her voice cracking with emotion, Grusová recalled her aunt, who like many Nazi camp survivors had her identity number tattooed on her arm. She said: “She was so beautiful, she was slim, she had the tattoo. But I didn’t understand that at the time.”
At first, the pair lived together in Czechoslovakia, but in 1947 her aunt emigrated to what was then Palestine. For reasons that remain unclear, Grusová was left behind and put up for adoption.
“I was six when my aunt left Czechoslovakia and I came to my new parents,” she said. “As a child, I was very sad that my aunt left. I didn’t understand why she didn’t take me with her.
“I was in contact with her for a while. She got married and had a son, whom I last saw in a picture when he was two years old.” But the correspondence with Edith petered out, and in 1966 “we lost each other,” she said.
Grusová never knew what happened to her aunt – until her son Jan, who speaks English, translated a surprising email his parents received from Schonwald Moss in 2021. He and his wife had spent years trying to trace his mother’s cousin, without success.

But with the help of professional researchers, Schonwald Moss had not only uncovered Grusová’s incredible tale but had also found that cousin – Edith’s son, Yossi Weiss, now 67 and living in the Israeli city of Haifa.
Weiss and Grusová “met” online last year, alongside other members of the newly discovered family tree. Weiss had known nothing of his cousin and his own life had been blighted by tragedy – having lost both his mother and his son to suicide.
Over the summer, Grusová flew to Israel with her husband, their son Jan and his wife Petra to meet Weiss and members of his wider family, including Schonwald Moss, who had traveled from South Africa for the occasion.
Grusová told CNN: “They wanted to meet me and come to visit me, but my cousin has cancer and he can’t travel.
“I was scared of the long journey at my age,” she said. “Now I am so pleased I went. I am just sad this didn’t come earlier.
“If it wasn’t for Covid, I would have never found out I have such a big family.”
Grusová – who speaks neither Hebrew nor English – communicated with her new-found relatives via an interpreter. Together they visited her late aunt’s grave, the Theresienstadt museum and the World Holocaust Remembrance Center at Yad Vashem, where she recorded her personal testimony and was also filmed for an Israeli news channel.
First cousins Alice Grusová and Yossi Weiss had an emotional reunion in Israel over the summer.
Michalya Schonwald Moss
Simmy Allen, head of international media at Yad Vashem, was there at the time. He told CNN that it was a “very emotional gathering,” adding: “The idea that the family was uniting and different sides of the family were really discovering their roots and coming to Yad Vashem to solidify that, so that their ancestors have a place that will remember them in perpetuity.”
Grusová said: “My family increased in size a lot. And Michalya keeps finding more and more relatives.”
Weiss told CNN he had known little about his mother’s earlier life and was unable to explain why she left his cousin behind when she moved to what was then Palestine.
“From the little bit she told me I knew she worked in a factory and she came back to the city after the war and she was lucky to survive,” he said. “I knew she was married before and her husband was killed on the Russian front but I didn’t know the chapter of finding Alice.”
Of their reunion, he said: “I made sure I had private time with Alice.
“We opened up the issue of my mother coming to Israel and Alice staying behind and agreed that things were complicated.”

The question will forever remain unanswered, though Weiss has tried to make sense of it. “My mother was a Holocaust survivor coming back from the camps at the age of 25 and had just lost her husband. Alice was five. My mother couldn’t provide her home, school, food and everything,” he said.
Perhaps she thought her niece would have been better off with adoptive parents, he added.
“It hurts me on a personal level because sometimes I fantasize about ‘what if,’” he said.
Grusová felt similarly: “Of course I thought about what my life would have been. As a child, I was very sad that my aunt left. I didn’t understand why she didn’t take me with her.”
“My cousin tried to explain,” she added. “She was young, her life was saved by a miracle. I am not blaming her for anything.”
Of the reunion with Grusová, Weiss said: “She wanted very much to see my mother’s grave. It was very important to her and part of the closure.”
Being at Yad Vashem with Grusová when she recorded her testimony was particularly poignant, he said. “It was very emotional and not easy for anyone.”

Schonwald Moss agreed. “It was one of the most extraordinary, intimate, emotionally healing experiences of my life,” she told CNN.
The family is now in talks with Steven Spielberg’s USC Shoah Foundation, which plans to record Alice’s video testimony in the new year.
“To discover that one family member had survived that we never knew about, and that she was still alive and living in Prague, was as if we had found a living ghost. And then to discover her story was especially heartbreaking,” said Schonwald Moss.
“By having her anew in our lives, she’s taught us what living looks like. Everyday is a repair for our family. And thanks to Alice and the sparkle in her eyes and the love she emanates, we have become a family again.”
Roi Mandel, MyHeritage’s director of research, welcomed the outcome for Grusová and her family. “Alice’s story is the story of many who survived the war and assumed they were left alone in the world, not knowing that there was another branch that survived,” he said.
“Decades of disconnection as a result of the Iron Curtain that was raised over Eastern Europe, have come to an end thanks to the technology that makes it possible to connect pieces of a puzzle that it seemed would never come together.”
Clarification: An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that Schonwald Moss worked with a Czech genealogist. The genealogist is based in Slovakia.

The biggest wild card in the climate crisis

New study finds octopuses are capable of surprisingly human-like behavior

 — 
Negative emissions. Carbon capture. Net zero.
It can be daunting, and a little exhausting, keeping up with the terminology from the annual UN climate talks, known as COP27, which are taking place in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt.
But CNN’s coverage can help you understand what’s at stake, what action needs to be taken and demystify the technical lingo.
Plus, we take a deeper look at an overlooked driver of climate crisis: the thawing permafrost.
Mission critical
An explosive buildup of methane — a potent greenhouse gas — is thought to have formed craters in Siberia.
Evgeny Chuvilin/Skoltech
I first became interested in permafrost — the layer of frozen ground beneath the Arctic tundra and high-latitude boreal forests — two years ago when reporting about mysterious holes that had suddenly appeared in remote parts of Siberia.
The craters are perhaps the most extreme example of the dramatic changes happening in the northernmost reaches of the planet as polar regions warm four times faster than the global average.
Permafrost is a particularly unpredictable wild card in the climate crisis. The carbon-storing frozen earth may already be emitting as much greenhouse gas as a country with a large carbon footprint, such as Japan.
Scientists particularly fear “abrupt thaw” that is exposing deeper layers of permafrost and has the power to shock the landscape into releasing more carbon.
Going green
Many are doing their best to minimize a personal role in climate change. But how about going green in death?
Recompose, the first human composting company in the United States, has converted more than 200 corpses into soil and has more than 1,100 people signed up for its prearrangement program.
Demand is likely to grow: California just became the fifth US state to sign a human composting bill into law, and others are considering similar legislation.
Advocates hope it can help slow the climate crisis, with cremations requiring lots of fuel. Carbon emissions from cremating one corpse is the equivalent of driving 470 miles (756 kilometers) in a car, according to one estimate. However, the industry is still new, and there is little research on how much better human composting is for the environment compared with traditional burials.

Explorations
Kirsten Abildtrup's brain, in bucket 738, sits on a shelf at the University of Southern Denmark in Odense.
Samantha Bresnahan/CNN
Denmark is home to what’s thought to be the world’s largest collection of brains — a cache of 9,479 of them. It’s a valuable resource for brain research on conditions such as dementia and depression, but one with a dark and controversial history.
The brains belonged to psychiatric patients in Denmark who died between 1945 and 1982 and did not consent to the organ donation. One of the specimens belonged to Kirsten Abildtrup, the great-aunt of journalist Lise Søgaard. Søgaard remembers a picture of Kirsten as a little girl on her grandmother’s wall. No one ever spoke about the child in the photo.
In a quest to understand what happened to her great-aunt, Søgaard discovered her relative’s brain in the collection, now housed in a basement at the University of Southern Denmark in Odense. Kirsten had died at age 24 while being treated for schizophrenia after having a lobotomy a year earlier.
By sharing her family’s story last year in a Danish newspaper, Søgaard has sought to break some of the stigma surrounding mental illness.
Ocean secrets
An expedition to the wreck of the Titanic has led to a surprising discovery.
Divers encountered a rocky reef, made up of volcanic formations, and teeming with lobsters, deep-sea fish, sponges and several species of coral that could be thousands of years old.
The location was earmarked for investigation after Titanic diver P.H. Nargeolet detected a sonar blip in 1996. The veteran submersible pilot initially had thought the anomaly, picked up on echo sounding equipment, might be another shipwreck.
Meanwhile, explorers searching in the Atlantic Ocean for World War II artifacts uncovered debris from the Space Shuttle Challenger, which exploded shortly after takeoff in 1986.
Dig this
A 3,700-year-old ivory lice comb was inscribed with 17 letters forming seven words in Canaanite.
Dafna Gazit/Israel Antiquities Authority
The oldest known sentence written in an alphabet has been found in an unexpected place — a lice comb.
The 3,700-year-old ivory comb was unearthed in 2016 during a dig at an Israeli archaeological site called Lachish, but an inscription on the comb wasn’t discovered until five years later. A smartphone snapshot revealed 17 letters that form seven words in Canaanite — the first known alphabet and the source of the one we use to write the English language in today.
The comb is a wonderfully human portal into the past, and the inscription captures a sentiment familiar to anyone unlucky enough to have encountered the pesky critters.
The wonder
Make time for these remarkable reads:
— An exciting medical breakthrough could soon make a difference for people with rare blood types, sickle cell disease or those with certain genetic disorders.
— One of nature’s great mysteries may now have an answer, according to a new study on “fairy circles” in the Namib Desert.
— Octopuses have been caught on video deliberately throwing silt and shells at each other. It could be another example of their humanlike behavior.
— Here’s what the latest image from the James Webb Space Telescope has to do with Taylor Swift’s new song “Bejeweled.”

Jubilant Kherson residents hug liberating soldiers – but know Russians are still just over the river
By CNN International Diplomatic Editor Nic Robertson, CNN

'Absolute euphoria': CNN on the ground as Kherson celebrates liberation
02:32 - Source: CNN
Kherson, Ukraine
CNN
 — 
Once the scene of Russian occupation, the drive into newly liberated Kherson city was eerily quiet.
For much of the journey through smaller towns and settlements, our team of CNN journalists was forced to drive through diversions and fields: bridges over canals were blown up, and roads were full of craters and littered with anti-tank mines.
Trenches and checkpoints were empty, quickly abandoned by Russians who on Friday announced they had withdrawn from the west bank of the Dnipro River in the strategic southern region of Kherson, leaving the regional capital of the same name and surrounding areas to the Ukrainians.
The outskirts of the city, which had been occupied by Russian forces since March 3, were deserted, with no military presence except for a Ukrainian checkpoint around 5 miles outside of the city center, where half a dozen soldiers waved CNN’s crew in.
Billboards around the city that once read “Ukraine is Russian forever” have reportedly been spray-painted over with the message: “Ukraine was Russia’s until November 11.”
No water, power or internet -- only euphoria in newly liberated Kherson
The city’s residents have no water, no internet connection and little power. But as a CNN crew entered the city center on Saturday, the mood was euphoric.
Once the scene of large protests against Russian plans to transform the region into a breakaway pro-Russian republic, the streets of Kherson are now filled with jubilant residents wrapped in Ukrainian flags, or with painted faces, singing and shouting.
The military presence is still limited, but huge cheers erupt from crowds on the street every time a truck full of soldiers drives past, with Ukrainian soldiers being offered soup, bread, flowers, hugs and kisses by elated passersby.
As CNN’s crew stopped to regroup, we observed an old man and an old woman hugging a young soldier, with hands on the soldier’s shoulder, exchanging excited “thank yous.”
Crowds in Kherson are joyful, cheering and singing and thanking soldiers.

After living under Russian occupation, every person we’ve spoken to has had experiences that have terrified them: earlier today, a teenager told CNN he had been taken and beaten by Russian soldiers who believed he was a spy. Residents told us they are emotionally exhausted, and overwhelmed by what this new-found freedom means.
With the occupiers gone, everyone wants you to understand what they’ve been through, how euphoric they feel right now, and how much they’re grateful to the countries who have helped them.
But Ukrainians are under no illusion that Kherson’s freedom spells the end of their country’s ordeal, or the difficulties that winter will bring.
Everyone we have spoken to is aware that there are tougher days to come: that the Russians across the river could shell them here. It is also unclear whether all Russian troops have left Kherson and the wider region. Behind this euphoria, there’s still that uncertainty.
But for today, at least, they’re celebrating.
CNN’s Amy Woodyatt contributed to this report.

Lagos, Nigeria
""Wakanda Forever,"" the sequel to ""Black Panther,"" Marvel Studios' award-winning $1.3 billion grossing movie, had its African premiere in Nigeria -- the first time Marvel has held an African premiere there.
Attending the event in Lagos, on Sunday, November 6, the film's director, Ryan Coogler, and several leading actors spoke to CNN about the importance of celebrating the film in Africa's most populous country, and how they hope the continued exploration of different cultures and history will impact global audiences.
The film follows the death in 2020 of Chadwick Boseman, who played King T'Challa -- the Black Panther -- in the original movie, released in 2018.
'Black Panther: Wakanda Forever' pulls off a difficult dive after Chadwick Boseman's death
With the introduction of new anti-hero Namor, the king of underwater kingdom Talokan, who breaches Wakanda's defenses while the country is still grieving the loss of T'Challa, ""Wakanda Forever"" presents another mythical and powerful nation, -- this time with roots in Mayan culture.
Coogler, who also co-wrote the script, said that introducing another rich heritage was on the cards when he started developing the idea of the sequel in 2018. ""We wanted to ramp it up by making it more culturally specific, more detailed, more personal. And even after Chadwick passed away, we stayed the course. I was speaking with him before he passed and he was excited about the direction that the film was going in,"" said Coogler.
""Our diversity is our strength""
The 2018 film was one of the highest grossing films in Africa, with audiences responding favorably to the kingdom of Wakanda, which represented an amalgam of African countries and cultures and an ideology of an Africa many would like to see.
Lupita Nyong'o, the Kenyan-Mexican actress who plays Wakandan spy Nakia, told CNN she hopes global audiences will connect with the diversity showcased in the movie. ""There is power in a diverse human experience,"" she said. ""I think it's always good to be able to relate to people who do not look like you and to see your humanity in them. Our diversity is our strength as human beings.""

Nyong'o and her co-star, Zimbabwean-American actress and writer Danai Gurira, attended the Black Panther premiere in South Africa in 2018, and to them, having more of the cast come to the continent they call home is significant. ""There's always a comfort coming back to the continent. We are very different around Africa, but there's also a through line there,"" said Nyong'o. ""There's just something that feels more familiar, more accessible and I love that.""
The film's score and soundtrack also celebrates the cultures championed in the movie, featuring a mix of Latin American and African artists such as Grammy-winning Nigerian artist Burna Boy, Ghana's Amaarae, UK artist Stormzy, whose mother is Ghanaian, and Grammy-nominated Nigerian singer-songwriter Tems, who co-wrote the lead single ""Lift me up,"" sung by Rihanna. The soundtrack was recorded in Nigeria, Mexico and London.
How 'The Woman King' created a warm and epic Dahomey Kingdom for the big screen
Gurira, who reprises her role as General Okoye, the leader of the Dora Milaje, Wakanda's all-female army, said of the premiere: ""This feels like massive progress that so many of us are here this time. I'm very excited to be here and I think it is different from being in the US or in the West because the story is so rooted in the continent that the idea of it being celebrated here in a big way is only right.""
Also in attendance were actors Winston Duke, who plays M'baku, leader of the Jabari Tribe, Letitia Wright, who plays tech-whiz Princess Shuri, and Tenoch Huerta as Namor. The premiere was one of the opening films at the African International Film Festival (AFRIFF), which runs until 12 November.
""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" is released in theaters worldwide on November 11.

My son has been asking for a dress. I finally decided to just get him dresses despite being afraid he’d get teased by other kids. Today, the boy next door asked why he was wearing a dress, I said “he wanted one” and he said “okay” then they continued to play. The kids are alright

 — 
A bouncing baby gorilla has been born at the Fort Worth Zoo in Texas.
The unnamed infant is just the second-ever western lowland gorilla born at the facility, according to a Facebook post.
The baby was born early on November 6 to parents Gracie and Elmo, the zoo says.
He likely weighs between 4 and 5 pounds, which is normal for newborn gorillas. But by the time he’s an adult, he might weigh as much as 500 pounds, according to the Smithsonian Zoo’s size estimates for western lowland gorillas.
Please don't lick this psychedelic toad, National Park Service warns
Gorillas fall into two species: western and eastern gorillas, each of which has two subspecies. The western lowland gorilla is the most widespread and numerous of the four subspecies, according to the World Wildlife Fund, although the exact size of the population is unknown. The large apes live in the dense rainforests of Cameroon, the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon and the Republic of Congo.
But even though the western lowland gorilla is the most numerous gorilla subspecies, it has still faced serious population decline over the last decades due to poaching and disease, says the World Wildlife Fund. The species is categorized as critically endangered by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature.
So far, the newborn gorilla is “staying close to his mother” while meeting other members of the Fort Worth Zoo’s gorilla troop, according to the Facebook post.

“The pair continues to bond but are also fully integrated into the troop, mimicking family dynamics in the wild,” the zoo said.
Visitors can catch a glimpse of the mother and baby at the zoo’s World of Primates exhibit. The facility has six gorillas, not counting the newborn, according to its website.

Newly formed lakes in the permafrost landscape of Russia's Siberia.
Evgeny Chuvilin/Skoltech
Belching lakes, mystery craters, ‘zombie fires’: How the climate crisis is transforming the Arctic permafrost
By Katie Hunt, CNN
Published 7:06 AM EST, Sat November 12, 2022
CNN
 — 
Four years ago, Morris J. Alexie had to move out of the house his father built in Alaska in 1969 because it was sinking into the ground and water was beginning to seep into his home.
“The bogs are showing up in between houses, all over our community. There are currently seven houses that are occupied but very slanted and sinking into the ground as we speak,” Alexie said by phone from Nunapitchuk, a village of around 600 people. “Everywhere is bogging up.”
What was once grassy tundra is now riddled with water, he said. Their land is crisscrossed by 8-foot-wide boardwalks the community uses to get from place to place. And even some of the boardwalks have begun to sink.
“It’s like little polka dots of tundra land. We used to have regular grass all over our community. Now it’s changed into constant water marsh.”
Thawing permafrost — the long-frozen layer of soil that has underpinned the Arctic tundra and boreal forests of Alaska, Canada and Russia for millennia — is upending the lives of people such as Alexie. It’s also dramatically transforming the polar landscape, which is now peppered with massive sinkholes, newly formed or drained lakes, collapsing seashores and fire damage.

Overlooked and underestimated
It’s not just the 3.6 million people who live in polar regions who need to be worried about the thawing permafrost.
Everyone does – particularly the leaders and climate policymakers from nearly 200 countries now meeting in Egypt for COP 27, the annual UN climate summit.
The vast amount of carbon stored in the northernmost reaches of our planet is an overlooked and underestimated driver of climate crisis. The frozen ground holds an estimated 1,700 billion metric tons of carbon – roughly 51 times the amount of carbon the world released as fossil fuel emissions in 2019, according to NASA. It may already be emitting as much greenhouse gas as Japan.
Permafrost thaw gets less attention than the headline-hogging shrinking of glaciers and ice sheets, but scientists said that needs to change — and fast.
“Permafrost is like the dirty cousin to the ice sheets. It’s a buried phenomenon. You don’t see it. It’s covered by vegetation and soil,” said Merritt Turetsky, director of the Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research at the University of Colorado Boulder. “But it’s down there. We know it’s there. And it has an equally important impact on the global climate.”
It’s particularly pressing because Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has stopped much scientific cooperation, meaning a potential loss of access to key data and knowledge about the region.
Warmer summers — the Arctic is warming four times faster than the global average — have weakened and deepened the top or active layer of permafrost, which unfreezes in summer and freezes in winter.
This thawing is waking up the microbes in the soil that feast on organic matter, allowing methane and carbon dioxide to escape from the soil and into the atmosphere. It can also open pathways for methane to rise up from reservoirs deep in the earth.
“Permafrost has been basically serving as Earth’s freezer for ancient biomass,” Turetsky said. “When those creatures and organisms died, their biomass became incorporated into these frozen soil layers and then was preserved over time.”
As permafrost thaws, often in complex ways that aren’t clearly understood, that freezer lid is cranking open, and scientists such as Turetsky are doubling efforts to understand how these changes will play out.

Climate wild card
Permafrost is a particularly unpredictable wild card in the climate crisis because it’s not yet clear whether carbon emissions from permafrost will be a relative drop in the bucket or a devastating addition. The latest estimates suggest that the magnitude of carbon emissions from permafrost by the end of this century could be equal to or bigger than present-day emissions from major fossil fuel-emitting nations.
“There’s some scientific uncertainty of how large that country is. However, if we go down a high emissions scenario, it could be as large or larger than the United States,” said Brendan Rogers, an associate scientist at the Woodwell Climate Research Center in Massachusetts.
He described the permafrost as a sleeping giant whose impact wasn’t yet clear.
“We’re just talking about a massive amount of carbon. We don’t expect all of it to thaw … because some of it is very deep and would take hundreds or thousands of years,” Rogers said. “But even if a small fraction of that does get admitted to the atmosphere, that’s a big deal.”
Projections of cumulative permafrost carbon emissions from 2022 through 2100 range from 99 gigatons to 550 gigatons. By comparison, the United States currently emits 368 gigatons of carbon, according to a paper published in September in the journal Environmental Research Letters.
Smoke from a wildfire is visible behind a permafrost monitoring tower at the Scotty Creek Research Station in Canada's Northwest Territories in September. The tower burned down in October from unusual wildfire activity.

‘Abrupt thaw’
Not all climate change models that policymakers use to make their already grim predictions include projected emissions from permafrost thaw, and those that do assume it will be gradual, Rogers said.
He and other scientists are concerned about the prevalence of abrupt or rapid thawing in permafrost regions, which has the power to shock the landscape into releasing far more carbon than with gradual top-down warming alone.
The traditional view of permafrost thaw is that it’s a process that exposes layers slowly, but “abrupt thaw” is exposing deep permafrost layers more quickly in a number of ways.
For example, Big Trail Lake in Alaska, a recently formed lake, belches bubbles of methane — a potent greenhouse gas, which comes from thawing permafrost below the lake water. The methane can stop such lakes from refreezing in winter, exposing the deeper permafrost to warmer temperatures and degradation.

Rapid thawing of the permafrost also happens in the wake of intense wildfires that have swept across parts of Siberia in recent years, Rogers said. Sometimes these blazes smolder underground for months, long after flames above ground have been extinguished, earning them the nickname zombie fires.
“The fires themselves will burn part of the active layer (of permafrost) combusting the soil and releasing greenhouses gases like carbon dioxide,” Rogers said. “But that soil that’s been combusted was also insulating, keeping the permafrost cool in summer. Once you get rid of it, you get very quickly much deeper active layers, and that can lead to larger emissions over the following decades.”
Also deeply concerning has been the sudden appearance of around 20 perfectly cylindrical craters in the remote far north of Siberia in the past 10 years. Dozens of meters in diameter, they are thought to be caused by a buildup and explosion of methane — a previously unknown geological phenomenon that surprised many permafrost scientists and could represent a new pathway for methane previously contained deep within the earth to escape.
“The Arctic is warming so fast,” Rogers said, “and there’s crazy things happening.”

War a ‘disaster for our scientific enterprise’
A lack of monitoring and data on the behavior of permafrost, which covers 15% of the exposed land surface of the Northern Hemisphere, means scientists still only have a patchwork, localized understanding of rapid thaw, how it contributes to global warming and affects people living in permafrost regions.
Rogers at the Woodwell Climate Research Center is part of a new $41 million initiative, funded by a group of billionaires and called the Audacious Project, to understand permafrost thaw. It aims to coordinate a pan-Arctic carbon monitoring network to fill in some of the data gaps that have made it difficult to incorporate permafrost thaw emissions into climate targets.
The project’s first carbon flux tower, which tracks the flow of methane and carbon dioxide from the ground to the atmosphere, was installed this summer in Churchill, Manitoba. However, plans to install similar monitoring stations in Siberia are in disarray as a result of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
“It’s always been more challenging to work in Russia than other countries … Canada, for example,” Rogers said. “But this (invasion), of course, has made it exponentially more challenging.”
Sebastian Dötterl, a professor and soil scientist at ETH Zurich, a Swiss university, who studies how warmer air and soil temperatures change plant growth in the Arctic, was able to travel to the Norwegian archipelago of Svalbard in the Arctic this summer to collect soil and plant samples.
However, the field trip cost twice as much as initially budgeted because the group was forbidden to use any Russia-owned infrastructure, forcing the team to hire a tourist boat and reorganize its itinerary. But Dötterl said the more pressing issue is that he can no longer interact with his counterparts at Russian institutions.
“We are now splitting a rather small community of specialists all over the world into political groups that are disconnected, where our problems are global and should be connected,” he said.
Turetsky agreed, saying that the war in Ukraine had been a “disaster for our scientific enterprise.”
“Russia and Siberia are huge, huge players. … Many of the (European Union-) and US-funded projects to work in Siberia to do any kind of lateral knowledge sharing, they’ve all been canceled.
“Will we stop trying? No, of course not. And there’s a lot we can do with existing data and with global remote sensing products. But it’s been a real setback for the community.”

 — 
Larry David made a prediction about this week’s crypto meltdown that was prettaaay prettaaay good.
In a Super Bowl ad for the FTX crypto exchange in February, Larry David sarcastically predicted that FTX wasn’t going to make it. The ad shows David’s character throughout history, naysaying humanity’s greatest inventions, including the wheel, the lightbulb, coffee and democracy.
At the end of the ad, David learns about FTX, “a safe and easy way to get into crypto.” A dismissive David says, “Ehhh, I don’t think so. And I’m never wrong about this stuff — never.”
“Don’t be like Larry,” the FTX ad closes.
The ad resurfaced on social media this week after FTX imploded. David’s character was, it turns out, right to be skeptical.
FTX filed for bankruptcy proceedings in the United States on Friday, marking a stunning downfall for one of the biggest and most powerful players in the crypto industry. CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, the 30-year-old founder of the exchange, resigned.
Rival Binance had said it would explore an FTX bailout earlier this week but almost immediately backtracked after the company said FTX was essentially beyond saving.
The full extent of FTX’s financial problems aren’t yet known, but multiple reports say the firm is facing an $8 billion shortfall. Without a quick infusion of equity, Bankman-Fried reportedly told investors Thursday, the firm was facing bankruptcy.
Despite its reputation as a dependable, low-risk investment portal, FTX’s business appears to have been built on a complex, extremely risky kind of leveraged trading.
Customers deposited their money to engage in crypto trading. But it appears that FTX instead took billions of dollars worth of that money and loaned it out to its sister firm, Alameda, to fund those high-risk bets, according to The Wall Street Journal.
CEO Sam Bankman-Fried resigned Friday. He had been one of the faces of the crypto industry, amassing a fortune once totaling $25 billion that has since vanished. He was viewed as the crypto world’s white knight, stepping in to rescue struggling companies earlier this year. FTX, backed by elite investors like BlackRock and Sequoia Capital, rapidly became one of the biggest crypto exchanges in the world.
Regulators are now swirling to investigate what went wrong, and some lawmakers are demanding a crackdown.
– CNN Business’ Matt Egan contributed to this report.

My son has been asking for a dress. I finally decided to just get him dresses despite being afraid he’d get teased by other kids. Today, the boy next door asked why he was wearing a dress, I said “he wanted one” and he said “okay” then they continued to play. The kids are alright

No water, power or internet – only euphoria in newly liberated Kherson

Kherson, Ukraine
CNN
 — 
For eight months, residents of the Ukrainian city of Kherson have been living under brutal Russian occupation. But on Friday, Ukrainian forces swept into the city and Russian troops retreated to the east.
The residents have no water, no internet connection and little power. But as a CNN crew entered the city on Saturday, the mood was euphoric.
As the crew filmed live in Kherson’s central square, some in the crowd of locals sang the national anthem while others shouted “Slava Ukrayini!” – glory to Ukraine, a patriotic greeting.
“We feel free, we are not slaves, we are Ukrainians,” resident Olga told CNN.
Locals have also been climbing onto the tops of the buildings, including the cinema, in the square to erect Ukrainian flags. Soldiers driving through are greeted with cheers and asked to sign autographs on flags.
Russia's withdrawal from Kherson is a humiliating setback. Here's what it means for the war
Back when Russian troops rolled in at the beginning of the war, this was a city that tried to resist: people were taken away, tortured, disappeared, residents said.
“We were terrified by [the] Russian army, we were terrified by soldiers that can come any moment in our house, in our home – just open the door, like they are living here, and steal, kidnap, torture,” Olga said.
But now, people flock to the central square in the newly liberated city, wrapped in Ukrainian flags, singing and chanting “Freedom for Ukraine.”
“Everyone here is out celebrating in the square here. People are wearing the Ukrainian flag, they’re hugging the soldiers, they’ve come out to see what it’s like to have freedom,” Robertson said.
Katerina described the liberation as the “best day” of her life after eight months under Russian occupation. “Our town is free, my street is free,” she told CNN.
Another local resident named Andrew said he was so glad to see Ukrainian soldiers.
“I think lots of people were killed here. We just don’t know that yet,” he said of the period under occupation.
A Ukrainian Special Forces soldier, who gave his name only as Daniel, told CNN how his unit was the first to arrive in Kherson. “My commander put the flag on the top of the building,” he said.
“It was a real blast for us, finally. Before the 11th [of November], it was five days of hard work, real hard work. Ukrainian soldiers, as always, just confirmed again that they are stronger than the Russians.”
He added that the civilians in Kherson are the “real heroes” for lasting so long under Russian occupation. “I can’t imagine how happy they are right now,” he said.
The CNN team appeared to be the first international journalists to reach Kherson city center since it changed hands in the past 48 hours.
On Friday, Russia announced it had withdrawn from the west bank of the Dnipro River in the strategic southern region of Kherson, leaving the regional capital of the same name and surrounding areas to the Ukrainians.
The retreat represents a major blow for Putin’s war effort in Ukraine. Kherson was the only Ukrainian regional capital that Russian forces had captured since February’s invasion. Their withdrawal east across the Dnipro cedes large swathes of land that Russia has occupied since the early days of the war, and that Putin had formally declared as Russian territory just five weeks ago.

“It was a really hard time for everyone. Every Ukrainian family waited for our soldiers, for our army,” another Kherson resident told CNN on Saturday, recalling Russia’s months-long occupation.
The woman said it felt “amazing” to see Ukrainian troops in Kherson.
“We felt every day your support, thank you so much,” the woman added, before hugging Robertson.
Efforts to return the city to ‘normal life’
Ukrainian authorities are working to return the city to “normal life,” the head of the regional military administration, Yaroslav Yanushevich, said Saturday in a video message, adding that the city, oblast and district military administrations had arrived in the city and started duties.
“The national police and the security service of Ukraine have also taken up their duties. The State Service for Emergency Situations is clearing mines. We are working for the return of the city to normal life,” Yanushevich said.

About 200 police officers are currently working in the city, Ukraine’s National Police said in a statement Saturday.
“Roadblocks have been set up around and in the territory of Kherson. The regional police continue to record the crimes of the Russian occupiers,” the statement reads.
The main threat is from mines, police said, adding that explosives technicians were working on their detection and disposal. “One of the police sappers was injured today during the demining of an administrative building in Kherson,” police said.
Residents who have left Kherson are advised “not to rush to return until stabilization measures are completed,” police said.
Speaking Saturday on the next steps for the Ukrainian military, CNN military analyst Cedric Leighton said: “This is going to be a major urban operation. What you are going to see is a methodical operation to clear buildings of potential booby traps and mines.
“Another thing that the Ukrainians will have to do is they’re going to have to move their systems forward so that they can counter any possible Russian artillery that is going to be on the eastern bank of the Dnipro River.
“You can see that the Ukrainians have moved to that river bank, they are now controlling that area, they will have to mop up some remaining Russian forces that did not make it out of the west bank of the Dnipro River. But those that are there will probably either surrender or in essence be eliminated from the fight.”
People gathered in Maidan Square to celebrate the liberation of Kherson, in the capital, Kyiv, on Friday.

On Friday evening, Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky posted a nighttime video of celebrations in the city, where a crowd was waving flags and chanting “ZSU,” the Ukrainian acronym for the armed forces.
Earlier that day, the Ukrainian military’s southern operational command said Russian forces had been “urgently loading into boats that seem suitable for crossing and trying to escape” across the river.
It was unclear whether all Russian troops had left Kherson and the wider region. Serhiy Khlan, a member of Ukraine’s Kherson regional council, said the city was “almost under the control of the Armed Forces of Ukraine” but cautioned that some Russian troops might have remained behind in civilian clothing.
He warned that many Russian troops “threw away their military uniforms, and are now hiding with civilian clothes on.”
CNN’s Nic Robertson reported from Kherson and Amy Woodyatt wrote from London. CNN’s Sophie Tanno, Jorge Engels, Dennis Lapin, Radina Gigova, Mick Krever, Anna Chernova, Teele Rebane, Gianluca Mezzofiore and Tim Lister contributed to this report.

‘We didn’t think it would be this bad’: Beachfront homes in small Florida community washed away by Hurricane Nicole

Families rescued from rooftops as heavy flooding hits Brazil

CNN
 — 
Trip Valigorsky’s beachfront home in a tight-knit community in Volusia County, Florida had been in his family for nearly 15 years before it was washed away this week, as the dangerous storm surge and powerful winds caused by Hurricane Nicole swept across Florida.
“This home was my grandma’s favorite place,” Valigorsky told CNN. “Some of the best memories with her were here.”
Valigorksy is just one of many residents in the beachfront neighborhood of Wilbur-By-The-Sea whose homes were damaged or destroyed by the storm.
Homes are collapsing into the ocean in Florida. Here's what's behind the dangerous situation
In Volusia County, at least 49 beachfront properties, including hotels and condos, have been deemed “unsafe” in the aftermath of Nicole, which hit Florida’s eastern coast south of Vero Beach as a Category 1 hurricane early Thursday before weakening into a tropical storm and eventually becoming a post-tropical cyclone Friday afternoon.
Video from the county shows homes crumbling, reduced to wreckage, as Nicole’s waves erode the coastline. Separate video shows the county’s beach safety office collapsing into the rising water.
Sea level in this part of Florida has risen more than a foot in the past 100 years, according to data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and most of that rise has occurred in the past three decades.
Scientists and researchers have long warned that sea level rise is leading to more erosion and high-tide flooding — particularly during extreme coastal storms.
This has put even more stress on seawalls that are meant to protect coastal communities from high waves and water levels, many of which were destroyed this week by the storm surge. One seawall that was put up on Tuesday, which Valigorsky and his neighbors had hoped would protect their properties from damage, crumbled into the ocean by Wednesday, he said.

“It was stressful wondering if it would fall, and here we are,” Valigorsky said.
On Wednesday morning, Valigorsky decided to grab his essential belongings and his dog to evacuate the area as he watched the storm become even more severe. By the time he returned, all that remained of his home was the garage and the front foyer.
As his community begins to rebuild their neighborhood in the aftermath of Nicole, Valigorsky said he plans to reconstruct his home alongside his neighbors who also lost theirs.
‘People can’t prepare for it,’ resident says
Another resident, Phil Martin, lost his entire home during the hurricane this week.
“It was the most devastating thing to see,” Martin said. “We didn’t think it would be this bad.”
Martin said he has lived in the area for two years and the home was his permanent residence where he spent time with his children and grandchildren, playing soccer in the backyard or walking down to the beach.
“There’s no politics at the beach, everyone gets along,” Martin said, adding that his community and those surrounding Wilbur-By-The-Sea are keeping his spirits high.
“Everything happened very fast with this one,” he said. “But we’re going to rebuild, we’ve got this.”

Just six weeks ago, Hurricane Ian’s storm surge eroded parts of Florida’s eastern coast, hitting the area where a seawall was built behind Martin’s home as well as his neighbors’. Now, he said, that seawall is gone.
The back-to-back nature of storms is making seawalls – which are already aging – more vulnerable, Brian McNoldy, a senior research associate at the University of Miami’s School of Marine and Atmospheric Science, previously told CNN.
“It doesn’t really take a strong storm – you just need high tides or storm-agitated tides to wash away or put extra stress on the walls,” he said. “Having these two storms six weeks apart, if you don’t give places any time to repair or replenish, each storm definitely leaves its mark.”
Arlisa Payne, who has been a resident of the beachfront community for most of her life, told CNN affiliate Spectrum News 13 that she’s “never seen anything like this” after assessing the damage caused by Hurricane Nicole.
Although her home survived the storm, Payne said that she is concerned the seawall in front of her house is at risk of collapsing.
The mother of four children said many of her neighbor’s homes were not damaged by Hurricane Ian but they were hit hard by Nicole, making it difficult for the community to prepare for such storms.
“I think this caught a lot of people off guard,” she said. “How do you prepare for this? People can’t prepare for it.”

 — 
As midterm results continue to roll in days after Election Day, Democratic and Republican candidates have already been celebrating historic victories.
Heading into Election Day, both parties were looking to diversify their ranks of elected officials, both in Congress and beyond, and they appear on track to do so.
House Republicans will add new members of color to their conference, including John James, who will be the first Black Republican congressman from Michigan, and Juan Ciscomani, who will be the first Latino Republican to represent Arizona in Congress.
Democrats will make a breakthrough for LGBTQ representation in governor’s offices. In Massachusetts and Oregon, Democrats Maura Healey and Tina Kotek will become the nation’s first out lesbian governors.
Republican Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the former Trump White House press secretary, will be the first female governor of Arkansas. And Maryland Democrat Wes Moore will be the state’s first Black governor.
There are still several races that have not yet been called. But for now, here’s a look at the candidates who CNN projects will make history in the 2022 midterms.
This list will be updated as more winners are projected.
Alabama

AL-SEN: Republican Katie Britt will be the first elected female senator from Alabama, CNN projects, winning an open-seat race to succeed her onetime boss, retiring GOP Sen. Richard Shelby. Britt is a former CEO of the Business Council of Alabama and was the heavy favorite in the general election in the deep-red state. Two women have previously represented Alabama in the Senate, but both were appointed to fill vacancies.
Arizona
AZ-06: Juan Ciscomani will be the first Latino Republican elected to Congress from Arizona, CNN projects, winning election to the state’s 6th Congressional District. Ciscomani, who was born in Mexico and immigrated to the US with his family as a child, previously worked at the Tucson Hispanic Chamber of Commerce and was a senior adviser to Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey.
Arkansas

AR-GOV: Republican Sarah Huckabee Sanders will be the first woman elected governor of Arkansas, CNN projects, winning the office her father previously held for over a decade. Sanders, who earned a national profile in her role as press secretary in the Trump White House, is also the first daughter in US history to serve as governor of the same state her father once led.
AR-LG: Republican Leslie Rutledge will be the first woman elected lieutenant governor of Arkansas, CNN projects. Rutledge, the state attorney general, originally sought the open governor’s seat but switched to the lieutenant governor’s race after Sanders entered the GOP gubernatorial primary. Lieutenant governors are elected on separate tickets in Arkansas.
With the election of Sanders and Rutledge, Arkansas will join Massachusetts as the first states to have women serving concurrently as governor and lieutenant governor.
California
CA-SEN: Democrat Alex Padilla will be the first elected Latino senator from California, CNN projects, winning a special election for the remainder of Kamala Harris’ term as well as an election for a full six-year term. Padilla, the son of Mexican immigrant parents, was appointed by California Gov. Gavin Newsom to the seat Harris vacated when she became vice president.
CA-SOS: Democrat Shirley Weber will be California’s first elected Black secretary of state of state, CNN projects. Weber, a former state assemblywoman, has been serving in the position since last year after Newsom picked her to succeed Padilla, who was appointed to the US Senate.
CA-AG: Democrat Rob Bonta will be California’s first elected Filipino American attorney general, CNN projects. Bonta, who was born in the Philippines and immigrated with his family to the US as an infant, has been serving in the position since last year after Newsom appointed him to succeed Xavier Becerra, who left to become President Joe Biden’s Health and Human Services secretary.
CA-42: Democrat Robert Garcia will be the first out LGBTQ immigrant elected to Congress, CNN projects, winning election to California’s 42nd Congressional District. Garcia, who immigrated from Lima, Peru, in the early 1980s at the age of 5, is the current mayor of Long Beach.
Los Angeles Mayor: Democrat Karen Bass will be the first woman and the first Black woman elected mayor of Los Angeles, CNN projects. Bass, who currently represents a Los Angeles-area House seat, will defeat real estate developer Rick Caruso. Bass was on Joe Biden’s short list for a running mate in the 2020 campaign. She’s no stranger to making history: She previously served in the California State Assembly, where in 2008 she became the first Black woman to serve as speaker of a state legislature.
Bass said on November 17, the day after her race was called, that the accomplishment of becoming the first female mayor of Los Angeles and the magnitude of the job was “sinking in.”
“To me, when you do make history, when you’re in a position like this – and I was in a similar position when I was sworn in as speaker – it means that you have extra responsibility. You always have to make sure that you maintain excellence in every step of the way,” she said. “The path that you go is laying the foundation for those that come behind you.”
Colorado
CO-08: Democrat Yadira Caraveo will be the first Latina elected to Congress from Colorado, CNN projects, winning the race for the state’s new 8th Congressional District. Caraveo, a state representative and the daughter of Mexican immigrant parents, will defeat Republican state Sen. Barbara Kirkmeyer to win the seat located north of Denver.
Connecticut
CT-SOS: Democrat Stephanie Thomas will be the first Black woman elected secretary of state of Connecticut, CNN projects. Thomas, a member of the Connecticut House, will succeed appointed Democratic incumbent Mark Kohler.
Florida

FL-10: Democrat Maxwell Frost will be the first member of Generation Z elected to Congress, CNN projects, winning the open seat for Florida’s 10th Congressional District. Generation Z refers to those born after 1996. Frost will succeed Democrat Val Demings, who vacated the seat to run for Senate.
The 25-year-old representative-elect told CNN’s Poppy Harlow on November 9 that when President Joe Biden called to congratulate him, the President recalled being too young to be sworn in as a senator when he was first elected at age 29.
“He asked me if it was the same situation. I said, ‘No, Mr. President, you had me beat on that. I’m already old enough to be sworn in on January 3.’ So, it was great to talk with him. You know, he was elected at a very young age, too, so he understands that experience,” Frost said on “CNN This Morning.”
Frost, who made reducing gun violence a central part of his campaign, also told CNN that he will work to pass universal background checks in Washington.
Illinois
IL-03: Democrat Delia Ramirez will be the first Latina elected to Congress from Illinois, CNN projects, winning election to the state’s redrawn 3rd Congressional District. Ramirez, a Chicago-area state representative and the daughter of Guatemalan immigrants, was also the first Guatemalan American to serve in the Illinois General Assembly.
IL-17: Democrat Eric Sorensen will be the first out gay person elected to Congress from Illinois, CNN projects, winning election to the state’s 17th Congressional District. Sorensen, a former Rockford and Quad Cities meteorologist, will defeat Republican Esther Joy King in the race to succeed retiring Democratic Rep. Cheri Bustos.
Maryland

MD-AG: Anthony Brown will be the first Black person elected attorney general of Maryland, CNN projects. Brown, who currently represents Maryland’s 5th Congressional District, has a been a longtime fixture in state politics, having also served as state lieutenant governor and in the state House and run for governor in 2014.
Massachusetts

MA-GOV: Democrat Maura Healey will be one of the first out lesbian governors in US history, CNN projects, winning an open-seat race for the governorship of Massachusetts. Healey, the current attorney general of Massachusetts, will also be the commonwealth’s first elected female governor. Also making history with Healey as one of the nation’s first out lesbian governors is Oregon Democrat Tina Kotek.
With the election of Healey and her running mate, Kim Driscoll, Massachusetts will join Arkansas as the first states to have women serving concurrently as governor and lieutenant governor.
MA-AG: Democrat Andrea Campbell will be the first Black woman elected attorney general of Massachusetts, CNN projects. Campbell, who ran for Boston mayor last year, was previously the first Black female president of the Boston City Council.
Michigan
MI-10: John James will be the first Black Republican elected to Congress from Michigan, CNN projects, winning election to the state’s 10th Congressional District. James, who lost bids for US Senate in 2018 and 2020, will defeat Democrat Carl Marlinga in the open-seat race for the redrawn suburban Detroit district.
MI-13: Democrat Shri Thanedar will be the first Indian American elected to Congress from Michigan, CNN projects, winning election to the state’s 13th Congressional District. Thaneder, who immigrated to the US from India, was elected to the Michigan House in 2020 and unsuccessfully sought the Democratic nomination for governor in 2018.
Nevada
NV-SOS: Democrat Cisco Aguilar will be the first Latino elected secretary of state of Nevada, CNN projects. Aguilar, who is Mexican American, will defeat Republican nominee Jim Marchant, a former state assemblyman who has repeatedly promoted false conspiracy theories about elections in Nevada.
New York
NY-GOV: Democrat Kathy Hochul will be the first elected female governor of New York, CNN projects, winning a full four-year term to the office she assumed last year after Gov. Andrew Cuomo resigned. Hochul, who previously served as the state’s lieutenant governor and a Buffalo-area congresswoman, will defeat Republican Lee Zeldin.
NY-03: Republican George Santos will be the next congressman from New York’s 3rd Congressional District, CNN projects, winning the first House election between two out gay candidates. Santos, an investor and the son of Brazilian immigrants, will defeat Democrat Robert Zimmerman for the Long Island-based seat.
Ohio
OH-09: Democrat Marcy Kaptur will win a 21st term to the House from Ohio, CNN projects, and will become the longest-serving woman in Congress when she’s sworn in next year to represent the state’s 9th Congressional District. Kaptur, who was first elected in 1982 and is currently the longest-serving woman in House history, will break the record set by Barbara Mikulski, who represented Maryland in the House and Senate for a combined 40 years.
Oklahoma

Jim Inhofe, who is resigning in January. Mullin, a member of the Cherokee Nation, currently represents the state’s 2nd Congressional District. Democrat Robert Owen, also a member of the Cherokee Nation, represented Oklahoma in the Senate from 1907 to 1925.
Oregon
OR-GOV: Democrat Tina Kotek will be one of the first out lesbian governors in US history, CNN projects, after winning an open three-way race for the governorship of Oregon. Kotek, a former speaker of the state House, will succeed term-limited Democratic Gov. Kate Brown. She will share the distinction as the nation’s first out lesbian governor with Massachusetts Gov.-elect Maura Healey.
OR-05: Republican Lori Chavez-DeRemer will join Democrat Andrea Salinas as the first Latino members of Congress from Oregon, CNN projects.

Kurt Schrader in Oregon’s 5th Congressional District.
OR-06: Democrat Andrea Salinas will join Republican Lori Chavez-DeRemer as the first Latino members of Congress from Oregon, CNN projects. Salinas, a state representative whose father immigrated to the US from Mexico, will defeat Republican Mike Erickson to win the state’s new 6th Congressional District.
Pennsylvania

This story has been updated with additional developments.
CORRECTION AND UPDATE: An earlier version of this story was updated to reflect that CNN had not projected a result in Colorado’s 8th Congressional District at that point. On November 18, 2022, CNN projected Democrat Yadira Caraveo as the winner.

Brooklyn Nets owner Joe Tsai says he believes Kyrie Irving ‘does not have any beliefs of hate towards Jewish people’

Brooklyn Nets owner Joe Tsai says he believes Nets star Kyrie Irving “does not have any beliefs of hate towards Jewish people.”
Tsai tweeted on Friday: “Clara and I met with Kyrie and his family yesterday. We spent quality time to understand each other and it’s clear to me that Kyrie does not have any beliefs of hate towards Jewish people or any group.
“The Nets and Kyrie, together with the NBA and NBPA, are working constructively toward a process of forgiveness, healing and education.”
Tsai’s tweet refers to the National Basketball Players Association (NBPA) where Irving currently serves as one of six vice presidents on the nine-person executive committee.

The Nets suspended Irving last week after he doubled down on his decision to share an Amazon link to a documentary criticized as antisemitic to his millions of social media followers. The 30-year-old NBA star apologized on his Instagram account after his suspension was announced.
Earlier in the week, NBA commissioner Adam Silver said he believes that Irving is not antisemitic following a meeting between the two.
Silver, who is Jewish, told the New York Times that the two had “a direct and candid conversation” at the league’s headquarters in New York.
“He’s someone I’ve known for a decade, and I’ve never heard an antisemitic word from him or, frankly, hate directed at any group,” Silver said.
In a follow-up call with the newspaper, Silver added: “Whether or not he is antisemitic is not relevant to the damage caused by the posting of hateful content.”
Irving warms up before the game against the Indiana Pacers at Barclays Center.

Irving could return to NBA action as soon as Sunday when the Nets take on the Los Angeles Lakers at the Crypto.com Arena.
Silver said the Nets along with the league will consult to decide when Irving can return from suspension.
In addition to the suspension, Irving is required to complete other steps to return to the court.
Brooklyn Nets general manager Sean Marks said previously that Irving would need to pass “some remedial steps and measures” for the star to rejoin the team.

Why Planet Fitness hasn’t raised its $10 monthly gym price in 30 years
By Nathaniel Meyersohn, CNN Business

Pandemic-era bike boom goes bust

 — 
A gym membership in the United States typically costs around $50 a month. Boutique gyms and high-intensity classes run double and triple that.
Planet Fitness, however, has offered $10 monthly memberships for 30 years. The no-frills gym chain hasn’t raised the price, making it one of the few things that still costs the same despite the highest inflation in decades.
Planet Fitness blares out the $10 gym plan, which includes annual fees and free training, in commercials, and the company has long sponsored the New Year’s Eve celebration in Times Square to get people thinking about signing up for memberships as their resolution.
That almost sacrosanct $10 price has become a key part of the company’s brand positioning as an accessible, “judgment-free” club conducive to casual gym goers. Planet Fitness members typically go five or six times a month, and around 60% of them don’t visit in a 30-day stretch.
“It’s a very powerful marketing tool,” said Simeon Siegel, who covers the company at BMO Capital Markets. The $10 price is right in the sweet spot, he said: cheap enough to draw people to Planet Fitness who want to get in shape and, equally as important, not so expensive that they will cancel if they don’t go often.
For $10 a month, infrequent users are likelier to hold onto the membership to say they belong to a gym rather than quit, he said.

Planet Fitness uses $10 dues, which can be canceled at anytime, to recruit people who are interested in exercising, but have never joined a gym before, are intimidated by fitness fanatics at other gyms or can’t afford pricier clubs. The company believes $10 is an entryway for the roughly 80% of Americans who don’t belong to a gym.
This inexpensive gym membership model – known in the fitness industry as high volume, low price, or “HVLP” – is also tailored to appeal to high-school students accompanied by a parent, college students and people recovering from an injury or surgery, said Rick Caro, the president of Management Vision and longtime fitness industry consultant.
“It’s a ‘get you off the couch’ price,” said Christopher Rondeau, the chief executive of Planet Fitness (PLNT), which has grown to more than 2,300 gyms nationwide and reached a record-high 16.6 million members last quarter. “You’re not going to give something a try for the first time and spend $50, $60, $70,” he said.
Planet Fitness does not plan to raise the $10 price anytime soon. Instead, it will hold down the price by getting people to trade up to its $24.99 monthly “Black Card” membership with more perks.
“The longer I can stay at $10 the better off I am to get people off the couch, give fitness a try and continue to drive more value in the Black Card,” said Rondeau.
The higher-priced monthly plan offers access to all of Planet Fitness’ gyms and perks like water massage beds, massage chairs and tanning equipment, and Black Card members can also bring a visitor.
Why Costco's $1.50 hot dog combo and 99-cent Arizona iced tea still cost the same
More than 60% of members subscribe to this tier, which Planet Fitness increased by $2 a month earlier in the year. The average Planet Fitness member pays around $17.60 a month, helping the company keep the lower plan at $10.
“It’s not that different from other businesses that entice you with a low price point and then upsell you with higher options,” said Joseph Altobello, an analyst at Raymond James.
To appeal to occasional gym goers, Planet Fitness’ clubs also have more cardio and light strength equipment than many competitors and fewer heavy free weights. Planet Fitness discourages what it calls “lunk” behavior, such as dropping weights and grunting, and has a “lunk alarm” to prevent people from dropping them.
Planet Fitness has benefited from the consolidation of the fitness industry during the pandemic, which has left the company with fewer budget-gym competitors.
Around 25% of US gyms and studios permanently closed during the pandemic – roughly 10,000 facilities, according to the industry trade group. Several major chains, including 24 Hour Fitness and Gold’s Gym, filed for bankruptcy.
Planet Fitness, however, did not permanently close any gyms during the pandemic. This was in large part due to its franchise gym model, with some of the gyms owned by private-equity groups.
The company has also capitalized on Americans looking to get in shape in the aftermath of the pandemic. Monthly visits to US gyms are higher than they were in 2019, according to Placer.ai, which tracks foot traffic to retailers.
Despite the rise of Peloton and the at-home workouts many people got used to during pandemic lockdowns, at-home exercise is not a threat to Planet Fitness’ $10 model.
“It’s a different customer,” Altobello said. “Not everyone has the money or the space to create an at-home gym.”

 — 
UFC president Dana White is getting into the slap game.
The longtime president of the UFC announced a new striking competition called Power Slap during a press conference on Friday.
The new venture will pit men and women competitors from around the world to showcase “power, technique and resolve.”
The sport features two opponents facing each other exchanging open-handed hits to the face one after another until one wins the match.
Alongside the new series, which is set to launch in early 2023, White announced a deal with TBS for an eight-part television series. Friday’s press release states competitors will vie to earn a place in “the cast house” and Power Slap rankings.
“The sport of slap fighting is about to go to a whole new level,” White said at the Power Slap press conference at Radio City Music Hall.
“The production level will be through the roof … everything about this thing is going to the next level.”
White is collaborating with former UFC CEO Lorenzo Fertitta and television producer Craig Piligian.
White added the series has been sanctioned by the Nevada State Athletic Commission (NSAC) – the first slap league to do so – with defined rules, rankings, weight classes and “extensive medical testing.”
“I’ve been working on this since 2017. I saw some footage of slap fighting on social media and I was instantly hooked. From the first day I saw it, I felt like this could be big. I knew what needed to be done to make it a real sport just like we did with MMA,” said White.
Last month, White put out an all-call via social media telling fans: “If you have ever professionally slapped, or think you can, email a video to our casting team.”
A coin toss will determine the option of whether or not the winner would like to slap or defend first. There will be a 30 second clock to deliver the slap, and another 30 seconds for recovery. The minimum number of rounds for each competition will be three.
Victory will be determined via knockout, TKO, or by points. Like boxing and MMA, Power Slap judging is based on a “10-point must system,” with a round winner scoring 10 points and the opponent scoring 9 or fewer.
According to the Power Slap website: “judging criteria is based on the striker’s effectiveness, as well as the defender’s reaction and recovery time.”
Striker fouls include “clubbing, stepping, illegal wind-up and delay of game.” Defender fouls include “flinching, blocking and delay of game.”
Warnings, point deduction, loss of strike, re-strike and disqualification can be adjudged if fouls are assessed.

Rainn Wilson announces name change to raise climate change awareness
By Lisa Respers France, CNN
Updated 5:40 PM EST, Fri November 11, 2022
Actor Rainn Wilson, seen here attending the 2019 Toronto International Film Festival, is hoping his environmental advocacy will get the attention of world leaders.

 — 
Rainn Wilson has “changed” his name and is inviting others to do the same.
“The Office” actor debuted “Rainnfall Heat Wave Rising Sea Levels Wilson” on social media Thursday as a way to raise awareness about the climate control crisis.

“As a cheap little stunt to help save planet Earth, I’ve changed my name on Twitter, Instagram and even on my fancy writing paper,” he said in a video he shared on his verified social media accounts.
In the Twitter thread that included the video, Wilson added that he was unable to change his name on Twitter “… because Elon,” referencing guidelines implemented on the platform by new owner Elon Musk.
Wilson encouraged his followers to visit environmental advocacy group Arctic Basecamp’s “Arctic Name Changer” to get their own names to be used on their social media profiles in the hopes of capturing the attention of the world leaders assembling in Egypt for the COP27 international climate change conference.

Disneyland adds dolls in wheelchairs to 'It's a Small World' ride
Natasha Chen, CNN • Updated 11th November 2022
Facebook
Twitter
Email
Anaheim, California (CNN) — For the first time in Disneyland's 67-year history, there are now characters in wheelchairs represented on an attraction.
On Friday morning, two dolls in wheelchairs were unveiled on the theme park's ""It's a Small World"" ride, a project that took more than half a year and involved both Disney creatives and the park's accessibility team.
The change was part of an ongoing effort of looking at the resort ""with a magnifying glass"" for opportunities for inclusion, said Kim Irvine, executive creative director of Walt Disney Imagineering for Disneyland Resort.
Jill Houghton, president and CEO of Disability:IN, a nonprofit that works on business disability inclusion, called the new dolls ""a fantastic addition.""
""The dolls are participating inclusively alongside their non-disabled peers, which is something we want to see more of, instead of being depicted as limited or incapable because of a disability,"" Houghton said in a statement to CNN.
She noted that the Americans with Disabilities Act was passed in 1990, ""but nothing in this law compels businesses to increase representation.
""Disney clearly sees the benefits of attracting a wider audience that is inclusive to everyone. We need to see more of this in pop culture, theme parks and entertainment if we want to be truly representative of the largest minority group in the world,"" Houghton said.
The ""It's a Small World"" attraction, designed by Disney artist Mary Blair, opened in 1966 in Anaheim, California, after it was presented at the 1964-65 World's Fair in New York.
The same ride was added to other Disney parks around the world, where guests board a boat and sail through multiple countries, featuring more than 300 Audio-Animatronics figures representing children from around the world.
Irvine said the new additions fit into the spirit of the original attraction.
""What a wonderful story that Walt and Mary Blair, and the original Imagineers, put together about the children of the world and our unity all under one bright sun -- and how we really should rejoice together in that.""
The dolls that are now in wheelchairs were originally standing. Irvine said the same characters with the same clothing were recreated in a seated position, in wheelchairs designed to match the Mary Blair style.
One doll is located in the ride's South America scene, and the other appears in the final scene where dolls from many countries sing together.
Adding 'meaningful things'
The attraction at Disneyland reopened on Friday after a brief closure for the addition of these dolls and the installation of holiday décor for the ""It's a Small World Holiday"" edition of the ride that will run through early January.
While the holiday décor is seasonal, the dolls in wheelchairs are a permanent addition.
Dolls with wheelchairs are also expected to be added to ""It's a Small World"" in Walt Disney World and Disneyland Paris sometime next year.
But because each resort's version of the ride has a different layout and different sets, those new dolls and wheelchairs will be designed with the specific version of the ride in mind.
""I think that is definitely something that the original Imagineers would embrace and think was wonderful that we were looking at things like this,"" Irvine said.
""We are always looking to enhance our attractions with not just fun things, but meaningful things as well. And keeping timely with what's happening in the world, and especially, you know, making things new.
""I know we never want our attractions to become so predictable that you could ride them with your eyes closed and know what's going on in there. We like to constantly be surprising you with new things and important things, especially relevant things.""
The new dolls were the result of a more than six-month collaboration.
Disneyland Resort/Christian Thom
Erin Quintanilla, manager of accessibility for the Disneyland Resort, said this was a historic moment.
""I feel seen. I feel represented. It's a monumental moment to have my community be in an attraction and represented,"" said Quintanilla, who uses a wheelchair. ""I teared up when I saw them in the attraction.""
Quintanilla said her team had been approached by Disneyland creatives who wanted to add these dolls. Her accessibility team made sure the look was authentic, down to the angle of the dolls' feet on the wheelchair footplates.
""We wanted to make sure that it was a person in a wheelchair who was independently moving through life. So we didn't want the wheelchair to feel like a hospital style wheelchair. You'll notice in the design, it's beautifully created to align with a Mary Blair style,"" said Quintanilla.
""But there are details of the wheelchair like having a push rim so that the doll would be able to move through the story in a way that I move through the world. So it's pretty special to have those details be accurate,"" Quintanilla said.
Other changes from Disney
New dolls have not been added to the Disneyland version of this ride since 2009.
At that time, a ""Spirit of America"" room was added, including three Native American dolls and characters from the movie ""Toy Story.""
More dolls of specific Disney characters were added throughout the attraction.
As part of overall efforts to improve inclusion and diversity in its theme parks, Disney recently announced changing the Splash Mountain attraction, which is based on characters from ""Song of the South,"" into a theme inspired by ""The Princess and the Frog,"" featuring Disney's first Black princess.

 — 
Cryptocurrency exchange FTX, which filed for bankruptcy Friday, is investigating whether crypto assets were stolen and has moved all its digital assets offline, the company said Saturday. The assets could be worth more than $400 million, said crypto risk management firm Elliptic.
In a tweet early Saturday, FTX general counsel Ryne Miller said the company “initiated precautionary steps” and moved all its digital assets to cold storage, meaning the crypto wallet is no longer connected to the internet. This follows the announcement Friday that the exchange filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.
The week that took down a crypto behemoth
Elliptic said although the theft is unconfirmed, $473 million in crypto assets were apparently stolen from FTX.
The process was “expedited” Friday evening “to mitigate damage upon observing unauthorized transactions,” Miller said in a tweet.
Miller tweeted late Friday that FTX is “investigating abnormalities” regarding wallet movements “related to consolidation of FTX balances across exchanges.” The facts are still unclear and the company will share more information as soon as possible, he added.
The stablecoins and other missing tokens are being quickly converted to ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency after Bitcoin, on decentralized exchanges, Elliptic said. Elliptic said it is a common technique used by hackers to prevent their funds from being seized.
Larry David predicted FTX's implosion
FTX, until last week one of the most powerful players in the crypto industry, is experiencing a rapid collapse. Its 30-year-old founder and CEO Sam Bankman-Fried has resigned and has lost his $16 billion fortune in less than a week.
In its bankruptcy filing, FTX said it has between $10 billion and $50 billion of estimated liabilities and assets.
“I’m really sorry, again, that we ended up here,” Bankman-Fried wrote in a Twitter thread Friday. “Hopefully things can find a way to recover.”
Under a microscope
As scrutiny of crypto exchanges increases, Singapore-based crypto.com admitted to accidentally sending more than $400 million in Ethereum to the wrong account. Its CEO, Kris Marszalek, said on Twitter the transfer of 320,000 ETH was made three weeks ago to a corporate account at competing exchange Gate.io instead of to one of its offline, or “cold”, wallets.
And though funds were recovered, users are withdrawing from the platform fearing the same outcome as FTX. Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao issued a warning on Twitter saying, “if an exchange have to move large amounts of crypto before or after they demonstrate their wallet addresses, it is a clear sign of problems.”
‘We have since strengthened our process and systems to better manage these internal transfers,” Marszalek tweeted Sunday.

Banksy unveils mural in Ukrainian town liberated from Russians

 — 
Renowned street artist Banksy has unveiled his latest artwork in an Instagram post – a mural in the liberated Ukrainian town of Borodianka.
The artwork shows a female gymnast balancing on a pile of rubble on the side of a building damaged by Russian strikes.
The graffiti artist posted three images of the piece Friday on social media, with a simple caption reading “Borodyanka, Ukraine,” using an alternative spelling for the town’s name.
Speculation had been mounting that Banksy was in the war-torn country after a series of murals appeared in Borodianka, located about 35 miles northwest of the capital, Kyiv.
Borodianka was hit particularly hard by Russian airstrikes in the first few weeks of the conflict.
Ed Ram/Getty Images
One artwork, not officially claimed by the artist, depicted a man being flipped during a judo match with a little boy.
Another showed two children using a metal tank trap as a seesaw.
Borodianka was hit particularly hard by Russian airstrikes at the start of the invasion of Ukraine in February, with many buildings reduced to piles of rubble by long-range attacks.
It was home to 13,000 people before the war, but most fled after Russia’s invasion. What was left of Borodianka, after intense shelling and devastating strikes, was then occupied by Russian forces, who moved in on February 28.
A mural not officially claimed by Banksy shows a man being flipped during a judo match with a boy.

The town came back into Ukrainian control on April 1, and returning residents found their houses ransacked and shops pillaged with windows broken and contents stolen.
The letter “V” – a symbol used by Russia’s Eastern Military district in concert with the letter “Z,” an emblem for Moscow’s so-called “special military operation” – was found painted on buildings, vehicles and checkpoints.
The town has since been the focus of reconstruction efforts, with several tower blocks demolished as a result of damage caused by the fighting.

Kherson, Ukraine
CNN
 — 
For eight months, residents of the Ukrainian city of Kherson have been living under brutal Russian occupation. But on Friday, Ukrainian forces swept into the city and Russian troops retreated to the east.
The residents have no water, no internet connection and little power. But as a CNN crew entered the city on Saturday, the mood was euphoric.
As the crew filmed live in Kherson’s central square, some in the crowd of locals sang the national anthem while others shouted “Slava Ukrayini!” – glory to Ukraine, a patriotic greeting.
“We feel free, we are not slaves, we are Ukrainians,” resident Olga told CNN.
Locals have also been climbing onto the tops of the buildings, including the cinema, in the square to erect Ukrainian flags. Soldiers driving through are greeted with cheers and asked to sign autographs on flags.
Russia's withdrawal from Kherson is a humiliating setback. Here's what it means for the war
Back when Russian troops rolled in at the beginning of the war, this was a city that tried to resist: people were taken away, tortured, disappeared, residents said.
“We were terrified by [the] Russian army, we were terrified by soldiers that can come any moment in our house, in our home – just open the door, like they are living here, and steal, kidnap, torture,” Olga said.
But now, people flock to the central square in the newly liberated city, wrapped in Ukrainian flags, singing and chanting “Freedom for Ukraine.”
“Everyone here is out celebrating in the square here. People are wearing the Ukrainian flag, they’re hugging the soldiers, they’ve come out to see what it’s like to have freedom,” Robertson said.
Katerina described the liberation as the “best day” of her life after eight months under Russian occupation. “Our town is free, my street is free,” she told CNN.
Another local resident named Andrew said he was so glad to see Ukrainian soldiers.
“I think lots of people were killed here. We just don’t know that yet,” he said of the period under occupation.
A Ukrainian Special Forces soldier, who gave his name only as Daniel, told CNN how his unit was the first to arrive in Kherson. “My commander put the flag on the top of the building,” he said.
“It was a real blast for us, finally. Before the 11th [of November], it was five days of hard work, real hard work. Ukrainian soldiers, as always, just confirmed again that they are stronger than the Russians.”
He added that the civilians in Kherson are the “real heroes” for lasting so long under Russian occupation. “I can’t imagine how happy they are right now,” he said.
The CNN team appeared to be the first international journalists to reach Kherson city center since it changed hands in the past 48 hours.
On Friday, Russia announced it had withdrawn from the west bank of the Dnipro River in the strategic southern region of Kherson, leaving the regional capital of the same name and surrounding areas to the Ukrainians.
The retreat represents a major blow for Putin’s war effort in Ukraine. Kherson was the only Ukrainian regional capital that Russian forces had captured since February’s invasion. Their withdrawal east across the Dnipro cedes large swathes of land that Russia has occupied since the early days of the war, and that Putin had formally declared as Russian territory just five weeks ago.

“It was a really hard time for everyone. Every Ukrainian family waited for our soldiers, for our army,” another Kherson resident told CNN on Saturday, recalling Russia’s months-long occupation.
The woman said it felt “amazing” to see Ukrainian troops in Kherson.
“We felt every day your support, thank you so much,” the woman added, before hugging Robertson.
Efforts to return the city to ‘normal life’
Ukrainian authorities are working to return the city to “normal life,” the head of the regional military administration, Yaroslav Yanushevich, said Saturday in a video message, adding that the city, oblast and district military administrations had arrived in the city and started duties.
“The national police and the security service of Ukraine have also taken up their duties. The State Service for Emergency Situations is clearing mines. We are working for the return of the city to normal life,” Yanushevich said.

About 200 police officers are currently working in the city, Ukraine’s National Police said in a statement Saturday.
“Roadblocks have been set up around and in the territory of Kherson. The regional police continue to record the crimes of the Russian occupiers,” the statement reads.
The main threat is from mines, police said, adding that explosives technicians were working on their detection and disposal. “One of the police sappers was injured today during the demining of an administrative building in Kherson,” police said.
Residents who have left Kherson are advised “not to rush to return until stabilization measures are completed,” police said.
Speaking Saturday on the next steps for the Ukrainian military, CNN military analyst Cedric Leighton said: “This is going to be a major urban operation. What you are going to see is a methodical operation to clear buildings of potential booby traps and mines.
“Another thing that the Ukrainians will have to do is they’re going to have to move their systems forward so that they can counter any possible Russian artillery that is going to be on the eastern bank of the Dnipro River.
“You can see that the Ukrainians have moved to that river bank, they are now controlling that area, they will have to mop up some remaining Russian forces that did not make it out of the west bank of the Dnipro River. But those that are there will probably either surrender or in essence be eliminated from the fight.”

On Friday evening, Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky posted a nighttime video of celebrations in the city, where a crowd was waving flags and chanting “ZSU,” the Ukrainian acronym for the armed forces.
Earlier that day, the Ukrainian military’s southern operational command said Russian forces had been “urgently loading into boats that seem suitable for crossing and trying to escape” across the river.
It was unclear whether all Russian troops had left Kherson and the wider region. Serhiy Khlan, a member of Ukraine’s Kherson regional council, said the city was “almost under the control of the Armed Forces of Ukraine” but cautioned that some Russian troops might have remained behind in civilian clothing.
He warned that many Russian troops “threw away their military uniforms, and are now hiding with civilian clothes on.”

Russians staged the same scenes for their side. Before the war, 30% supported Ukraine, 30% Russia, and 30% just wanted to get on with their lives. The war didn’t start in 2022, it started in 2014 with a pro-western coup.

My son has been asking for a dress. I finally decided to just get him dresses despite being afraid he’d get teased by other kids. Today, the boy next door asked why he was wearing a dress, I said “he wanted one” and he said “okay” then they continued to play. The kids are alright

The oldest living person in the US just turned 115
By Zoe Sottile, CNN
Published 3:02 AM EST, Sat November 12, 2022
Bessie Hendricks (center), the oldest living person in the US, celebrated her 115th birthday on November 7th.

 — 
Bring out the candles – 115 of them.
Bessie Hendricks, the oldest living person in the United States, has celebrated yet another turn around the sun. The Iowa supercentenarian turned 115 on November 7, according to CNN affiliate KCCI.
The world's oldest person is a French nun who enjoys chocolate and wine
Hendricks was born in 1907. Her lifetime has seen 21 presidents, two world wars, and the sinking of the Titanic.
In addition to being the oldest living person in the United States, she is also the fourth-oldest living person in the world, according to the Gerontology Research Group, which records and certifies supercentenarians (people who have lived to be older than 110).
Hendricks celebrated her 115th birthday alongside her three children at Shady Oaks Care Center, according to KCCI.
“I don’t know how you put it into words,” said her daughter, Joan Schaffer, according to KCCI. Schaffer turned 90 the day before her mother’s 115th birthday. “It’s marvelous that we still have her.”
Hendricks’ children described her as a hard-working, caring mother. Hendricks’ own mother died when she was just 13 years old, according to KCCI.
Currently, the title for oldest living person belongs to Lucile Randon, a 118-year old French nun, says the Gerontology Research Group. The oldest person ever recorded was another Frenchwoman, Jeanne Louise Calment, who lived to be over 122 years old, according to the Guinness World Records. Calment died in 1997.

British Airways will let male staff wear makeup and piercings
Toyin Owoseje, CNN • Published 11th November 2022

(CNN) — British Airways is the latest airline to relax its rigid uniform rules in a bid to champion the individuality of its employees.
Following a recent update in the airline's uniform guidelines, pilots and cabin crew are now allowed to sport facial stubble, wear make-up, jewelry, and nail varnish of their choice -- regardless of their gender.
The carrier said it wanted workers to be the ""most authentic version of themselves"" in a bid to foster an ""inclusive"" environment.

Virgin Atlantic launches new gender-neutral uniform policy
""We are proud of all of our colleagues at British Airways and we are committed to an inclusive working environment,"" a British Airways spokesperson said in a statement to CNN on Friday.
""We have worked with our people to create updated guidelines for grooming, beauty and accessories, allowing our colleagues to bring the best, most authentic version of themselves to work every day.""
According to the UK's Guardian newspaper, BA's latest memo urges staff to ""be bold, be proud, be yourself.""
The move comes after rival airline Virgin Atlantic scrapped its gendered uniform policy as part of a wider series of initiatives under its ""Be Yourself"" agenda.

Back in September, Virgin Atlantic said male cabin and crew could wear skirts and their female colleagues could wear trousers because it wanted staff to feel comfortable -- ""no matter their gender, gender identity, or gender expression.""
Other recent reforms by the airline include allowing staff to display their tattoos while in uniform and make-up becoming non-compulsory for female staff.

Is the worst over for bitcoin and the rest of crypto?
It’s a terrible time to buy a house. Here’s what to know if you have to do it anyway

There is no sugarcoating it: This is a terrible time to buy a home.
Mortgage rates for a 30-year fixed rate loan are now hovering above 7%, more than 4 percentage points higher than a year ago. That has slashed a typical buyer’s purchasing power by 14%, according to Black Knight, a mortgage data company.
With fewer people able or interested in buying now, home sales have been falling. Just 16% of people say now is a good time to buy a home, a record low, according to a monthly survey conducted by Fannie Mae in October.
First-time homebuyers are being shut out of the market like never before
Still, that’s barely made a dent in home prices, which soared to new heights during the pandemic and are now just easing off of all-time highs.
Another thing tamping down sales is stubbornly low inventory of available homes for sale, said Jackie Lafferty, a real estate agent with Baird & Warner Real Estate in Chicago.
“It is something I’ve never seen a combination of, this lack of inventory and higher interest rates,” Lafferty said. “There is no motivation for people to move unless they have to.”
But whether people need to move because of a new job, a divorce, an addition to the family or they simply don’t want to give up after years of trying to buy a home, there are still buyers out there.
“Even if sales slow down, real estate doesn’t stop,” said Lafferty. “People need a place to live.”
For those who are pressing on, here are a few ways you can take some of the sting out of buying a home.
Take a loan now and refinance later
Buyers taking out a mortgage now are doing so with the hope that within a couple years, rates might meaningfully drop and they can refinance to a lower rate.
“Yes, rates have gone up much farther and faster than anyone expected them to,” said Melissa Cohn, regional vice president at William Raveis Mortgage. “But if you can afford to buy today and want and need to, you shouldn’t let the higher rate environment stop you, knowing that at some point in the next year, two years at the most, rates are likely to be significantly lower.”
The downside: You’ll still have to stomach the higher rate for the time being. There is some risk that interest rates may not fall, or at least not by much. And if mortgage rates don’t go down, you could be stuck with it for a while, said Delyse Berry, CEO and principal broker at Upstate Down in Rhinebeck, New York.
“There could be a decrease in rates in the middle of 2023,” she said. “If that comes to pass, you can do a refinance and secure a lower interest rate and lower payments. But these rates could now be the new cost of doing business.”
Plus, refinancing can be extremely costly. Typically, closing costs run between 2% and 5% of the loan’s principal amount.
And unexpected events may prevent you from refinancing, like losing your job or losing value in your home.
Get an adjustable rate loan
More home buyers are exploring options outside of the standard 30-year fixed-rate mortgage. For example, adjustable rate mortgages, or ARMs, now make up 12% of mortgage applications, up from 3% a year ago, according to Mortgage Bankers Association.
While the average rate for a 30-year fixed-rate loan was 7.08% last week, the rate for the 5-year Treasury-indexed hybrid adjustable rate mortgage was a full percentage point lower at 6.06%, according to Freddie Mac. Though they are still 30-year loans, ARMs offer a fixed rate for a set period – typically 5, 7 or 10 years – after which the interest rate resets to current market rates.
“Buying today is about figuring out what can you do to bridge this high-rate environment to get yourself comfortable with your acquisition,” said Cohn. “When rates drop, it is time to see what your more permanent solution will be.”
For buyers who may be moving out of the home in 5 to 7 years anyway, an ARM may be a way to boost purchasing power.
“For the first 5 or 7 years of an adjustable rate mortgage, it walks, talks and acts just like a fixed-rate mortgage,” said Cohn. “It has a lower rate and lower payment because the bank is only guaranteeing it for a shorter period of time.”
If rates come down, an ARM could reset to a better rate.
The downside: Borrowers must also accept the risk that rates could be even higher when the loan resets, or any time over the life of the loan. After the fixed period, ARMs can reset every year or every six months.
However, most do have caps on how much a rate can go up or down during each reset period and over the life of the loan, so it’s important to understand how your loan works.
Buy down your interest rate with points
Borrowers can lower their payments by paying more upfront to buy down their mortgage rate. This will lower the loan’s interest rate, either permanently or temporarily.
While a permanent buydown changes your rate for the life of a loan, a temporary buydown provides lower rates for a period of time.
Think mortgage rates are high now? Homebuyers in the 1980s were paying 19%
In a temporary buydown, typically borrowers get two percentage points off the loan’s rate for the first year, one percentage point off for the second year, and by the third year, the loan returns to its original rate for the remainder of its term. By then, many borrowers expect there to be lower interest rates, which leaves open the possibility of refinancing.
“That is a meaningful difference for the first year of the loan, lowering your rate from 7% to 5%,” said Cohn.
The downside: While getting a lower interest rate is very appealing, it means shelling out more money up front. That might not make financial sense if you don’t plan to stay in the house for a long time.
“It takes about five years to break even on paying down one point,” said Cohn. “Knowing that rates are likely to be meaningfully lower by then, you might be better off taking the money you’d use to pay for points to pay for refinancing later.”
Request a seller’s credit to buy down your rate
In some housing markets, competition among buyers has softened, and sellers are being forced to be more flexible on offers.
One way a buyer can reduce their payments is to ask for a seller’s credit, or a seller’s concession, as part of the deal. Buyers can then use that money to buy down the interest rate on their mortgage and reduce their monthly payments.
“Sellers are willing to negotiate more now than they have in the past,” said Trudy Kelly, a senior home loan specialist at Churchill Mortgage in Oregon.
In September, when mortgage rates were around 5.75%, Kelly worked with borrowers who were buying a $590,000 house. Rather than offering $15,000 or $20,000 below the asking price to reduce the cost of the monthly payments, the buyers asked for a $15,000 seller’s concession.
If the buyers had made the lower offer and got the home for $575,000, their monthly savings would be $78, said Kelly. But by paying down the interest rate by one percentage point, their payments dropped by $340 a month.
“That is a huge difference,” she said. “Ultimately, what that did for them was expand their budget. It lowered their debt-to-income ratio giving them more purchase power. It puts them in a time machine and takes them back to April or May [when rates were lower].”
The downside: In many areas, it’s still a seller’s market. Asking for a credit or concession might be less appealing to a seller if they have other offers.
Buy in cash or increase your down payment
If you’ve got the cash to buy a home, now is a good time to do it. Not only will you avoid paying a high rate on a mortgage, you’ll likely be able to negotiate for a better price.
But not many people can pay in cash: 97% of homebuyers over the past year needed to finance their home, according to a recent report from the National Association of Realtors.
Even if you don’t have enough for an all-cash deal, throwing more at the down payment will reduce the amount of your mortgage, lower your monthly payments, and mean paying less interest over the life of the loan. If you own your current home, you can leverage some of the cash from your sale or possibly even tap the equity to boost your down payment.
By making a larger down payment you will not only reduce your loan balance but also increase your home equity, money you can recoup when you sell – assuming the property appreciates.
The downside: Using cash toward a real estate purchase is always a trade-off, as you’ll have to forgo other potential investments. And for most buyers, coughing up more cash just isn’t an option. The typical down payment for first-time buyers was 6%, while it was 17% for repeat buyers. according to the National Association of Realtors.

In less than a week, Sam Bankman-Fried’s $16 billion fortune evaporated

 — 
Sam Bankman-Fried woke up on Monday still a billionaire, even as his cryptocurrency empire was beginning to unravel. By Friday, his fortune was completely wiped out.
Based on net worth calculations by Bloomberg, Bankman-Fried was worth about $16 billion at the start of the week. But as his crypto exchange, FTX, collapsed, the value of his assets was reduced to zero in what Bloomberg called “one of history’s greatest-ever destructions of wealth.”
Crypto is in chaos as FTX files for bankruptcy
FTX on Friday said it filed for bankruptcy, and Bankman-Fried, known as SBF, resigned as chief executive.
The 30-year-old entrepreneur’s net worth, which was largely tied up in digital assets, peaked at around $26 billion this spring. Over the summer, as crypto prices plummeted, Bankman-Fried emerged as a white knight for the sector, using his FTX exchange and its sister hedge fund, Alameda, to secure lines of credit to crypto companies like BlockFi and Voyager that were at risk of collapsing.
He told Reuters in July that he and FTX still had a “few billion” on hand to shore up other firms and help stabilize the industry.
Bankman-Fried owns about 70% of FTX’s US business, which the index now estimates to be essentially worthless. His stake in online brokerage Robinhood, previously valued at more than $500 million, was removed from Bloomberg’s calculation after news reports said that stake was held through Alameda and may have been used as collateral for loans.
As a follower of “effective altruism,” Bankman-Fried has sought to make as much money as possible in order to give it away. But the fate of his philanthropic endeavors is now in doubt.
On Thursday, the entire staff of the FTX Future Fund, which says it has committed $160 million in grants, publicly quit. In a statement, the five-person team wrote that they “have fundamental questions about the legitimacy and integrity of the business operations that were funding the FTX Foundation and the Future Fund.”

Kherson, Ukraine
CNN
 — 
For eight months, residents of the Ukrainian city of Kherson have been living under brutal Russian occupation. But on Friday, Ukrainian forces swept into the city and Russian troops retreated to the east.
The residents have no water, no internet connection and little power. But as a CNN crew entered the city on Saturday, the mood was euphoric.
As the crew filmed live in Kherson’s central square, some in the crowd of locals sang the national anthem while others shouted “Slava Ukrayini!” – glory to Ukraine, a patriotic greeting.
“We feel free, we are not slaves, we are Ukrainians,” resident Olga told CNN.
Locals have also been climbing onto the tops of the buildings, including the cinema, in the square to erect Ukrainian flags. Soldiers driving through are greeted with cheers and asked to sign autographs on flags.
Russia's withdrawal from Kherson is a humiliating setback. Here's what it means for the war
Back when Russian troops rolled in at the beginning of the war, this was a city that tried to resist: people were taken away, tortured, disappeared, residents said.
“We were terrified by [the] Russian army, we were terrified by soldiers that can come any moment in our house, in our home – just open the door, like they are living here, and steal, kidnap, torture,” Olga said.
But now, people flock to the central square in the newly liberated city, wrapped in Ukrainian flags, singing and chanting “Freedom for Ukraine.”
“Everyone here is out celebrating in the square here. People are wearing the Ukrainian flag, they’re hugging the soldiers, they’ve come out to see what it’s like to have freedom,” Robertson said.
Katerina described the liberation as the “best day” of her life after eight months under Russian occupation. “Our town is free, my street is free,” she told CNN.
Another local resident named Andrew said he was so glad to see Ukrainian soldiers.
“I think lots of people were killed here. We just don’t know that yet,” he said of the period under occupation.
A Ukrainian Special Forces soldier, who gave his name only as Daniel, told CNN how his unit was the first to arrive in Kherson. “My commander put the flag on the top of the building,” he said.
“It was a real blast for us, finally. Before the 11th [of November], it was five days of hard work, real hard work. Ukrainian soldiers, as always, just confirmed again that they are stronger than the Russians.”
He added that the civilians in Kherson are the “real heroes” for lasting so long under Russian occupation. “I can’t imagine how happy they are right now,” he said.
The CNN team appeared to be the first international journalists to reach Kherson city center since it changed hands in the past 48 hours.
On Friday, Russia announced it had withdrawn from the west bank of the Dnipro River in the strategic southern region of Kherson, leaving the regional capital of the same name and surrounding areas to the Ukrainians.
The retreat represents a major blow for Putin’s war effort in Ukraine. Kherson was the only Ukrainian regional capital that Russian forces had captured since February’s invasion. Their withdrawal east across the Dnipro cedes large swathes of land that Russia has occupied since the early days of the war, and that Putin had formally declared as Russian territory just five weeks ago.

“It was a really hard time for everyone. Every Ukrainian family waited for our soldiers, for our army,” another Kherson resident told CNN on Saturday, recalling Russia’s months-long occupation.
The woman said it felt “amazing” to see Ukrainian troops in Kherson.
“We felt every day your support, thank you so much,” the woman added, before hugging Robertson.
Efforts to return the city to ‘normal life’
Ukrainian authorities are working to return the city to “normal life,” the head of the regional military administration, Yaroslav Yanushevich, said Saturday in a video message, adding that the city, oblast and district military administrations had arrived in the city and started duties.
“The national police and the security service of Ukraine have also taken up their duties. The State Service for Emergency Situations is clearing mines. We are working for the return of the city to normal life,” Yanushevich said.

About 200 police officers are currently working in the city, Ukraine’s National Police said in a statement Saturday.
“Roadblocks have been set up around and in the territory of Kherson. The regional police continue to record the crimes of the Russian occupiers,” the statement reads.
The main threat is from mines, police said, adding that explosives technicians were working on their detection and disposal. “One of the police sappers was injured today during the demining of an administrative building in Kherson,” police said.
Residents who have left Kherson are advised “not to rush to return until stabilization measures are completed,” police said.
Speaking Saturday on the next steps for the Ukrainian military, CNN military analyst Cedric Leighton said: “This is going to be a major urban operation. What you are going to see is a methodical operation to clear buildings of potential booby traps and mines.
“Another thing that the Ukrainians will have to do is they’re going to have to move their systems forward so that they can counter any possible Russian artillery that is going to be on the eastern bank of the Dnipro River.
“You can see that the Ukrainians have moved to that river bank, they are now controlling that area, they will have to mop up some remaining Russian forces that did not make it out of the west bank of the Dnipro River. But those that are there will probably either surrender or in essence be eliminated from the fight.”
People gathered in Maidan Square to celebrate the liberation of Kherson, in the capital, Kyiv, on Friday.

On Friday evening, Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky posted a nighttime video of celebrations in the city, where a crowd was waving flags and chanting “ZSU,” the Ukrainian acronym for the armed forces.
Earlier that day, the Ukrainian military’s southern operational command said Russian forces had been “urgently loading into boats that seem suitable for crossing and trying to escape” across the river.
It was unclear whether all Russian troops had left Kherson and the wider region. Serhiy Khlan, a member of Ukraine’s Kherson regional council, said the city was “almost under the control of the Armed Forces of Ukraine” but cautioned that some Russian troops might have remained behind in civilian clothing.
He warned that many Russian troops “threw away their military uniforms, and are now hiding with civilian clothes on.”

NBA’s Miami Heat to terminate relationship with FTX, will get new arena name
By Jacob Lev, CNN

 — 
The NBA’s Miami Heat and Miami-Dade County have terminated their relationship with bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange FTX and will search for a new naming rights partner for their arena in downtown Miami.
The announcement came after the FTX group earlier on Friday filed for bankruptcy in the United States and its CEO resigned, marking a stunning downfall for one of the biggest and most powerful players in the crypto industry.
The sudden decline of one of the largest crypto exchanges could rattle the sports industry
Miami-Dade County and Miami Heat said in a joint statement Friday night that the reports about FTX are “extremely disappointing” and that they will work together to find a new naming rights partner for the arena, which was only renamed as FTX Arena last year.
Like other crypto companies, FTX has invested heavily in sports sponsorships. FTX had reportedly inked a reported $135 million, 19-year deal to rename the Miami arena in June 2021.
Los Angeles' Staples Center is becoming the Crypto.com Arena
Also, Major League Baseball struck a five-year deal in 2021 to name FTX as its official cryptocurrency exchange. FTX is also the official cryptocurrency exchange partner of the Mercedes-AMG Petronas Formula One Team.
Even college sports has ties to FTX, with the University of California, Berkeley, signing a $17.5 million, 10-year naming rights partnership in 2021 for the school’s football stadium.
CNN’s Jennifer Korn contributed to this report.

Dave Chappelle hosts ‘SNL’ tonight. Here’s a timeline of controversies surrounding his jokes about transgender people

 — 
Tonight Dave Chappelle will host “Saturday Night Live” for the third time – an appearance that is courting controversy before he even takes the stage.
The comedian has drawn increasing ire in recent years for making jokes aimed at transgender people, and the outcry grew louder last fall when Netflix released a Chappelle special, “The Closer,” in which he doubled down on his comments.
Netflix stood by Chappelle, who went on a national tour after the special and largely ignored the controversy after addressing it in his act.
But his comments were criticized by fellow comics, fans, trans advocates and some Netflix employees, and a Minnesota venue canceled a Chappelle show this year over the controversy.
Given that context, it was surprising to some “SNL” viewers to see him invited back to Studio 8H. Here’s a look at Chappelle’s recent history of jokes about trans people – and the resulting backlash.
2017
August: In a series of stand-up shows at New York City’s Radio City Music Hall, Chappelle made jokes aimed at trans people for at least 20 minutes, Vulture reported. He made explicit jokes about trans people’s bodies and referred to trans people as “transgenders,” among other comments, Vulture said.
These weren’t the first jokes Chappelle had made at trans people’s expense. But he delivered them in New York after drawing some backlash for earlier comments.
“That joke and others in this section suffer from the same problems as those from his specials – they are rooted in disgust and generalization,” Vulture wrote of a Chappelle joke about ISIS fighters being horrified by transgender soldiers. “They’re just not good.”
2019
August 26: Netflix released a stand-up special, “Sticks and Stones,” in which Chappelle performed more material about trans people, including some content from his Radio City shows. In an epilogue to the special, he brought up his friend Daphne Dorman, a trans comedian, whom he said laughed hardest at his jokes about trans people.
2021
October 5: Netflix released Chappelle’s special “The Closer.” In it, he goes on an extended tangent about transgender people and makes several jokes at their expense. He misgenders a trans comedian, once again makes explicit jokes about trans women’s bodies and defends TERFs, or trans-exclusionary radical feminists.
He also referred to trans people as “transgenders,” states that “gender is a fact” and later says that Dorman died by suicide shortly after she was criticized by other trans people for defending Chappelle after “Sticks and Stones.”
At the time Chappelle’s special was released, at least 33 states had introduced anti-transgender legislation, much of it aimed at young trans people.
Netflix standing by Dave Chappelle and 'The Closer'
October 13: Amid calls from LGBTQ advocates, fellow comedians, Netflix employees and social justice organizations to pull the special, Netflix stood by Chappelle.
In a letter obtained by the Verge and Variety, Netflix CEO Ted Sarandos told employees that the special will remain available to stream.
“We don’t allow titles on Netflix that are designed to incite hate or violence, and we don’t believe ‘The Closer’ crosses that line … Some people find the art of stand-up to be mean spirited but our members enjoy it, and it’s an important part of our content offering,” Sarandos wrote.
Netflix suspended three employees for attending a virtual meeting of directors to discuss the special without notifying the meeting organizer in advance. Among them was Terra Field, a trans senior software engineer who had publicly criticized the special and Netflix. Her suspension was later reversed.

October 19: Sarandos told Variety he “screwed up” his communications with Netflix employees but reaffirmed he did not believe the special qualifies as “hate speech.”
October 20: Around 65 demonstrators, including Netflix employees and trans advocates, participated in a walkout in protest of Netflix’s support of “The Closer.” The demonstrators called on Netflix to hire more trans and non-binary executives and fund more trans and non-binary talent.
What these trans comedians have to say about Dave Chappelle's jokes at their expense
October 24: Three trans stand-up comics told CNN they were disappointed by Chappelle’s jokes, even though all three said they once considered the celebrated performer as a comedy inspiration. While all of them agreed that jokes about trans people aren’t inherently offensive, they said Chappelle’s set was infused with the same hateful rhetoric and language used by anti-transgender critics.
“When he talks about the trans community, he’s not talking about them, he’s speaking out against them,” comedian Nat Puff told CNN. “And that’s the difference between saying something funny about the trans community and saying something offensive about the trans community.”
A fourth comic, Flame Monroe, one of the only trans comics whose material is streaming on Netflix, told CNN she believes Chappelle should be allowed to joke about trans people, even though she initially was taken aback by some of his comments.
October 25: Chappelle addressed critics at a show in Nashville, appearing alongside Joe Rogan, the podcast host who’s been criticized for dismissing the effectiveness of vaccines and using racial slurs, among other controversies.
Chappelle released videos on his official Instagram account from the set, in which he seemingly addressed the trans employees at Netflix who participated in the walkout over “The Closer.”
“It seems like I’m the only one who can’t go to the office anymore,” he said.
“I want everyone in this audience to know that even though the media frames it as though it’s me versus that community, that’s not what it is,” Chappelle went on. “Do not blame the LBGTQ (sic) community for any of this s—. This has nothing to do with them. It’s about corporate interest and what I can say and what I cannot say.”
“For the record – and I need you to know this – everyone I know from that community has been nothing but loving and supportive. So I don’t know what all this nonsense is about.”
2022
July 12: “The Closer” was nominated for two Emmys, including “outstanding variety special (pre-recorded).” Adele later won the category.
July 21: A Minneapolis venue canceled Chappelle’s sold-out show hours before its doors were set to open, apologizing to “staff, artists and our community” after receiving criticism for hosting Chappelle.
“We believe in diverse voices and the freedom of artistic expression, but in honoring that, we lost sight of the impact this would have,” wrote First Avenue, the venue famous for being featured in Prince’s “Purple Rain” film.

November 5: “Saturday Night Live” announced Chappelle would be its post-midterms host. The backlash was swift.
Field joked on Twitter: “Wait I thought I cancelled (sic) him. Is it possible cancel culture isn’t a real thing??”
November 10: After the New York Post reported that several “SNL” writers are boycotting Saturday’s episode, Chappelle’s representatives told CNN there are no issues with writers or cast members. “SNL’s” current staff includes nonbinary cast member Molly Kearney and nonbinary writer Celeste Yim.
Chappelle will take the stage live Saturday at 11:30 p.m. ET.

 — 
The stunning downfall of the FTX exchange, one of the biggest and most reputable players in the market for digital assets, is sparking alarm among people who own cryptocurrencies as investors run for cover.
There are still many unanswered questions. But two big ones loom: How far will the damage spread? And can the beaten-down crypto industry bounce back?
Industry insiders are debating whether to call the implosion of FTX, which filed for bankruptcy on Friday, a “Lehman moment,” referring to the 2008 collapse of the investment bank that sent shockwaves around the world. Many think it’s an apt comparison.
What’s clear is that the fallout from the FTX crisis injects significant volatility into the crypto ecosystem. The episode has destroyed confidence and emboldened regulators, which are now on high alert.
“This was one of the most trusted entities in the crypto space, so it will take some time to recover,” said Jay Jog, co-founder of the blockchain startup Sei Labs, which is based in California.
From best-in-class to bankruptcy
“Sh*tstorm.” “Insane.” “Chaos.”
Those are terms crypto investors and pundits have used to describe the failure of FTX, which was launched in 2019 by Sam Bankman-Fried, a 30-year-old wunderkind once hailed as a modern-day J.P. Morgan.
The company was valued at $32 billion in its latest funding round, and had recruited high-profile backers including SoftBank, Tiger Global, Singapore’s Temasek, as well as celebrities like Tom Brady, Gisele Bündchen and Naomi Osaka. Its name is on the arena where the Miami Heat play.
This week, investor Sequoia Capital said it had marked the value of its FTX stake down to $0. The exchange — said to be short between $8 billion and $10 billion — was unable to meet customers’ withdrawal demands. Bankman-Fried resigned Friday and FTX filed for bankruptcy protection in the United States after a bailout from rival Binance fell through.
“Everyone’s a little bit in shock,” said Shan Jun Fok, co-founder of Moonvault Partners, a crypto investment firm based in Hong Kong. “A lot of people trusted FTX as the gold standard.”
He compared the collapse of FTX to Enron, the 2001 corporate fraud scandal that resulted in the surprise bankruptcy of the US energy company.

The situation is still developing quickly. But one concern is how it could ripple throughout the entire crypto sector, which was worth more than $1 trillion in August.
Over the summer, as digital assets tumbled in value, Bankman-Fried put up about $1 billion to bail out firms and shore up assets to try to keep the entire industry afloat. Now, few white knights are left to rescue FTX and others in distress.
“The number of entities with stronger balance sheets able to rescue those with low capital and high leverage is shrinking within the crypto ecosystem,” strategists at JPMorgan said in a note to clients this week.
The demise of FTX could produce other casualties. It’s hard to know at this point who is exposed, though there are clear ripple effects.
Prices of bitcoin and ether, the two most-held cryptocurrencies, are more than 20% lower over the past week. The price of the Solana digital coin has also been battered thanks to reports that Bankman-Fried’s trading firm, Alameda Research, had sizable holdings. The Tether stablecoin, which is supposed to be a safe place to park cash, recently broke its one-to-one peg to the US dollar. And crypto lending platform BlockFi said Thursday that it was pausing customer withdrawals.
Traditional investors have also been burned, though they’re reassuring clients they can handle the fallout. The Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan said that despite uncertainty, losses tied to its $95 million investment would have a “limited impact,” given the stake represents less than 0.05% of total assets.
Changpeng Zhao, the CEO of Binance, tweeted that he had been messaging with Nayib Bukele, the president of El Salvador, which has gone all in on bitcoin. “We don’t have any Bitcoin in FTX and we never had any business with them,” Zhao relayed from Bukele. “Thank God!”
Can the crypto industry survive?
Analysts note that a lot of risky activity has already been flushed out of the system after a tumultuous few months.
But as spooked investors pull funds from crypto, more pain could arrive. JPMorgan believes bitcoin could fall to $13,000, a decline of nearly 22% from where it is now. Fok said the digital coin could drop below $10,000, a low it hasn’t plumbed since 2020.
In that climate, the “crypto winter” is poised to get even worse, especially as fears about the broader economic backdrop continue to erode the appetite for risky assets.
“In the short term, this is going to be really, really bad for the crypto industry,” said Jog of Sei Labs. But he doesn’t think it will “end things” entirely, and is hopeful that it could bolster interest in his business, which focuses on building more transparent, decentralized crypto exchanges.
Fok said he expects the FTX collapse will push institutional investors away from the crypto space just as they had been warming up to it. While some people will continue to work on interesting projects, it could take years to restore faith in the sector’s promise.
It’s also all but certain to embolden regulators to tighten the screws, raising costs for crypto firms that survive the unfolding purge.
“It reinforces the view that any sort of financial enterprise needs extensive regulation,” said James Malcolm, head of foreign exchange strategy and crypto research at UBS. “Probably by 2024, the whole world will look much more coherent and watertight.”
Gary Gensler, head of the US Securities and Exchange Commission, said on CNBC Thursday that while the crypto space is regulated, investors “need better protection.” The Wall Street Journal has reported that the SEC and the US Justice Department are investigating FTX. (The Department of Justice declined to comment.)
At a conference in Indonesia on Friday, Binance’s Zhao said that the 2008 financial crisis is “probably an accurate analogy” for what’s playing out.
“We’ve been set back a few years,” he said. “Regulators rightfully will scrutinize this industry much, much harder, which is probably a good thing, to be honest.”

Democratic super PAC to put millions behind new Georgia runoff ad as both parties turn focus to key contest
By Dan Merica, CNN
Updated 8:19 AM EST, Sat November 12, 2022

 — 
A top Democratic super PAC will begin airing a new ad attacking Republican Herschel Walker’s character on Saturday, as both parties turn their focus to a Georgia Senate runoff that may end up determining control of the Senate.
First provided to CNN, the ad, titled “Shown Us” from Georgia Honor – a group tied to the Senate Majority PAC, the predominant Democratic super PAC focused on Senate control – is backed by $4 million for one week of airtime, highlighting just how expensive and contentious the runoff between Walker and Democratic incumbent Sen. Raphael Warnock will be.
Whether or not the outcome of the Georgia runoff will determine control of the Senate is yet to be known, given that CNN projected a Democratic win in the Arizona Senate race on Friday night but has not yet projected a winner in the Nevada Senate contest. But even if Senate control is already decided, both Democratic and Republican organizations are prepared to pour money into the Georgia runoff.
The Senate Leadership Fund super PAC and the National Republican Senatorial Committee have already announced plans to invest millions of dollars to turn out Walker voters ahead of the December 6 runoff.
CNN projected this week that the race between Walker and Warnock would go to a runoff after neither candidate was able to get more than 50% of the vote, extending what was already one of the most expensive Senate races in the country by a month. From Labor Day to Election Day on Tuesday, Democrats and Republicans spent over $151 million solely on ads, trailing only the Senate race in Pennsylvania.
The ad from Georgia Honor – a group that spent over $30 million on ads in that period – calls Walker a liar who has a “long record of violence toward women.”
“Herschel Walker has shown us who he is,” a narrator says in the spot. “Herschel Walker is unfit for office.”
In a 2008 interview with CNN, Walker’s ex-wife, Cindy Grossman, said that Walker had held a razor to her throat, and at one point, “he held [a] gun to my temple and said he was going to blow my brains out.” Grossman did not respond to CNN’s request for comment when CNN reported on the interview again in September 2021.
“Raphael Warnock and his allies are using the same old tired attacks that didn’t work over the last few months,” said Will Kiley, a spokesman for Walker’s campaign. “His far left positions are out of step with the people of Georgia and it is time for change. Herschel Walker is the champion that the people of Georgia need.”
Veronica Yoo, a spokesperson for Georgia Honor, said, “The choice facing Georgians on December 6th could not be clearer, and we fully intend to communicate in every way possible to voters that Walker is unfit and unprepared to serve them in the United States Senate.”
Meanwhile, Senate Leadership Fund, the predominant Republican super PAC with ties to Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, is teaming up with Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp to help bankroll a get-out-the-vote operation to boost Walker, according to Jack Pandol, a spokesperson for the super PAC. The committee is dropping $2 million to bankroll the turnout operation that Kemp built for his own reelection.
The focus on getting out the vote highlights how Republicans are privately concerned that because Walker benefited from Kemp’s political operation in the general election this week, the Senate candidate could struggle without the governor at the top of the ticket in December.
The NRSC has also opened a joint fundraising committee with the Walker campaign and the Georgia Republican Party, said committee spokesman Chris Hartline, and the group launched an ad this week that compared the Georgia Senate race to “a miniseries” and argued that Warnock “belongs in Hollywood, not Washington,” noting some of the Democrat’s more unique campaign ads.
“Warnock is a great actor,” says a narrator, “he just doesn’t act like your senator. Spending, taxes, energy, you name it, Warnock votes with Joe Biden 96% of the time, and that act is getting old.”
34N22, another outside Republican group supporting Walker that worked on getting out the vote ahead of the general election, received a $500,000 donation from Sen. Rick Scott, the chair of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, to continue its work.
“34N22 is fully prepared to finish the fight, get Herschel Walker across the goal line, and evict Raphael Warnock on December 6th,” spokesperson Stephen Lawson said.
And, as CNN reported on Friday, with concerns around former President Donald Trump’s possible involvement in the Georgia runoff, one Trump aide said an idea being considered is helping Walker financially with a generous check from MAGA Inc., the Trump super PAC that gave $16.4 million to candidates in the closing weeks of the 2022 cycle.
Democrats, too, are beginning to pour money into the state.
The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee announced on Thursday that they would spend $7 million in field organizing ahead of the runoff, a substantial investment aimed at expanding the number of voters Democrats contacted ahead of the general election.
“We know talking directly to voters through a strong, well-funded ground-game is critical to winning in Georgia, and we’re wasting no time in kick-starting these programs in the runoff,” said Sen. Gary Peters, chair of the Democratic committee.
Both Walker and Warnock have already fully pivoted to the runoff.
Walker spent Thursday campaigning with Texas Sen. Ted Cruz.
“We are in overtime. We got a runoff,” Walker said at an event in Canton, Georgia. “I was built for this. God prepared me for this moment right here.”
Warnock, during a speech to supporters in Atlanta, said, “”I came really to ask you one question: Are you ready to do this one more time,” a nod to the successful runoff election he ran against Republican Kelly Loeffler in the 2020 cycle.
At that event, however, Warnock’s speech highlighted how the already contentious race could get even more acrimonious.
“We have seen that Herschel Walker has a disturbing history, a pattern of violence against women, against his own family, and he refused to take responsibility for that and he refuses to even answer questions,” Warnock said. “So, the question right now is this: Is that who we want representing Georgia? This is a job that requires honesty.”

Brown’s lawyer asks Jacque to pick up a duffel bag from a storage unit that contains things from James Brown’s final days. A man named Ghost asks if the duffel bag contains poison used to kill James Brown. Brown’s lawyer initially tells Jacque to throw the bag into a lake before telling her to contact authorities. Jacque makes an appointment to bring the duffel bag to a prosecutor. To learn more about how CNN protects listener privacy, visit cnn.com/privacy

Five years ago, a CNN reporter received a phone call from someone who said she could prove the Godfather of Soul was murdered. 

CNN’s podcast “The James Brown Mystery” follows the investigation that came next.

My son has been asking for a dress. I finally decided to just get him dresses despite being afraid he’d get teased by other kids. Today, the boy next door asked why he was wearing a dress, I said “he wanted one” and he said “okay” then they continued to play. The kids are alright

Nicole becomes post-tropical cyclone, brings rain to Northeast after leaving a trail of destruction in Florida
By Nouran Salahieh, CNN
Published 3:09 AM EST, Sat November 12, 2022

 — 
After wreaking havoc in Florida, Nicole weakened into a post-tropical cyclone, bringing severe thunderstorms to the Carolinas and Virginia Friday before striking the Northeast.
Nicole – the first hurricane to hit the US in the month of November in nearly 40 years – walloped coastal homes in Florida’s Daytona area early Thursday and left five people dead after hitting the state’s eastern coast as a Category 1 hurricane.
The storm’s remnants are now expected to track to the Northeast and eastern Canada through Saturday, with heavy rain and gusty winds spreading from the Mid-Atlantic and Ohio Valley to New England overnight, according to the National Hurricane Center.
Nicole kills at least 5 in Florida and leaves 'unprecedented' damage to Daytona-area coastline
Nicole is expected to produce an additional 1 to 3 inches of rain across parts of the Eastern seaboard through Saturday morning, before pushing off-shore and away from the Atlantic coast.
The central Appalachians and northern Mid-Atlantic areas, particularly in the Blue Ridge Mountains, were expected to see Isolated flash, urban and small stream flooding.
Heavy rain and isolated flooding are also expected across New England through early Saturday.
While many people in the Carolinas and Georgia were under wind advisories earlier Friday, areas of Massachusetts, New Jersey and New York remain under one until Saturday morning, according to the National Weather Service. Gusts of up to 50 mph were possible.
The system will continue to weaken as it moves northward Saturday, and its tropical moisture will be absorbed by a separate cold front, which delivered blizzard conditions across the northern Plains.
“The risk of excessive rainfall and localized flash flooding with this extratropical transition will continue to diminish through Saturday,” the prediction center said.

Destruction along Florida’s eastern coastline
As the storm moves away from the Sunshine State, the damage left behind in Florida’s Volusia County coast is clear to see.
Beachfront homes and hotels have collapsed into the ocean. At least 49 beachfront properties, including hotels and condos, have been deemed “unsafe,” according to county officials.
“The Volusia Coast has been devastated by hurricanes Ian and Nicole,” Volusia County Beach Safety Capt. A.J. Miller said in a video statement Friday. “Damage assessments from these two storms combined have totaled in the hundreds of millions of dollars with over 30 homes and two dozen hotels and condos that have been evacuated.”

'We are in trouble here in Daytona': Coastal homes collapse into the ocean

Buildings in the area were battered by Hurricane Ian just weeks before Nicole’s arrival, and were further threatened by coastal erosion as incoming Nicole pushed rising ocean water onshore on top of exceptionally high tides.
When Nicole arrived, it tore through homes in Wilbur-By-The-Sea, a barrier island community off Daytona Beach.

Among the badly damaged structures on the island was Nina Lavigna’s home. She lost 33 years of memorabilia in the storm, Lavigna told CNN affiliate WESH.
Nicole during landfall ripped Lavigna’s bedrooms away from the rest of her house, leaving the home exposed to the ocean and badly damaged. In the rooms left standing, her granddaughters pink shoes could be seen among the rubble.
On Friday, Lavigna said she flagged down Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis as he toured the wreckage.
“I asked him if he could send us some help. Because we need some help here,” she said.
DeSantis said on social media the state is “committed to restoring our communities and beaches.”
“Florida’s Atlantic Coast has been hit hard by 2 storms in less than 2 months. Dozens of buildings have been condemned or destroyed by erosion,” the governor tweeted Thursday. The state “will use $20 million for emergency sand placement,” he said.

As residents navigate the storm’s aftermath, Miller warned there are still dangers on the beach as recovery efforts continue. The storm left a multitude of hazards residents must maneuver in the hurricane’s wake.
“The amount of destruction is unprecedented and the beach is littered with massive amounts of debris, both in the water and onshore,” Miller said.
At least five people were killed in the storm. In Florida’s Orange County, two people died after being “electrocuted by a downed power line,” the sheriff’s office said in a news release. Another two deaths are being investigated as possibly storm-related following a fatal car accident, according to Orange County Mayor Jerry Demings.
Also killed was a 68-year-old Port Canaveral man who had been on a yacht early Thursday morning as it was “being battered by the waves and the dock,” the Cocoa Police Department said.
CNN’s Haley Brink, Derek Van Dam, Theresa Waldrop, Melissa Alonso and Caroll Alvarado contributed to this report.

Man in Scotland confirmed to be US rape suspect, Scottish court rules
By Alex Hardie, CNN
Published 8:10 PM EST, Fri November 11, 2022
The defendant denies he is Nicholas Rossi, who the US is seeking for trial in Utah on a charge of rape

CNN
 — 
A man in Scotland is a rape suspect wanted in the United States, a Scottish court ruled Friday, despite the man’s claims that he is not the person authorities are looking for and that he never visited the US in his life.
An Edinburgh Sheriff’s Court judge said that that the man claiming to be “Arthur Knight” among other aliases, is in fact Nicholas Rossi, whom the US is seeking extradition to face trial in Utah on a charge of rape, the ruling said.
An Interpol Red Notice – which is a request for law enforcement worldwide to provisionally arrest a person – was issued by the US for Rossi on October 4, 2021.
Rossi is wanted to stand trial for alleged felony rape charges in Utah County, according to a press release from county attorney David O. Leavitt. The alleged crimes occurred in 2008, according to a Utah Department of Public Safety press release.
That is not the only charge against him in the US. In September, Salt Lake County District Attorney’s office charged Rossi with a separate charge of felony rape stemming from a 2008 incident, according to a probable cause affidavit.
CNN has reached out to the defendant’s lawyer for comment.
Fingerprint experts compared prints provided by the US extradition request with those taken from the man claiming to be Knight and “positively identified the impressions of two fingers,” the court document said.
According to the document, the man explained the match by saying that the US obtained his fingerprints through a health service worker when he was hospitalized last year – a claim that Sheriff Norman McFadyen dismissed as “unsupported by any evidence,” “scandalous,” and “implausible and fanciful.”
McFadyen wrote that he also compared photos of tattoos provided by the US extradition request with witness descriptions of the man’s tattoos, concluding that “there is powerful evidence of similarity of quite distinctive tattoos being seen on Mr Knight which resemble in detail the distinctive tattoos on the photographs of Nicholas Rossie.”
According to the court document, the man claiming to be Knight said he had been tattooed while in a coma in the hospital – an explanation also rejected by McFadyen as “implausible and fanciful.”
McFadyen heard testimony from two intensive care staff at a Glasgow hospital where the man was treated for serious Covid-19 complications last year, the court document said. He also heard testimony from a police constable, detective constables, a registrar, a doctor, the man in question and his wife, Miranda Knight.
“Mr. Knight is indeed Nicholas Rossie [sic], the person sought for extradition by the United States,” said McFadyen in his conclusion, noting that he would have been prepared to accept the fingerprint match alone as sufficient evidence.
The decision did not issue any kind of conclusion as to whether Rossi should be extradited or whether he is guilty of the US allegations.

In search for unidentified victims of 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre, remains were found of a man with a gunshot wound
By Raja Razek, CNN
Published 12:31 AM EST, Sat November 12, 2022
State archaeologist Kary Stackelbeck makes notes at an excavation site at Oaklawn Cemetery while searching for victims of the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre, Friday, Oct. 28, 2022 in Tulsa, Oklahoma.

CNN
 — 
Amid efforts to find unidentified victims of the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre in Oklahoma, a forensic anthropologist discovered that one of three sets of remains exhumed last week included a victim with a gunshot wound, authorities said.
The remains were uncovered at an excavation site in the Oaklawn Cemetery this year while crews were working to find additional victims, according to a news release from the city of Tulsa.
“During lab work, a bullet core was removed from the victim’s skull,” the release said. “At this time, experts believe the victim to be an adult male, though no definitive information on race or potential relation to the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre can be confirmed at this time.”
More unmarked graves discovered in search for Tulsa Massacre victims
The gunshot victim was buried in a plain casket in the Original 18 Potter’s Field area, authorities added.
This is the second gunshot victim found in the search for potential victims from the massacre, according to the release. The first gunshot victim was found during last year’s excavation.
“DNA analysis of the first gunshot victim continues in Utah with Intermountain Forensics and no definitive information about potential relation to the Tulsa Race Massacre can be confirmed at this time,” the release read.
The city is in the midst of a yearslong investigation into the events of the 1921 massacre, which was inflicted by a violent White mob that targeted Black residents and destroyed Tulsa’s Greenwood district, a thriving Black economic hub. As many as 300 hundred people were killed and more than 1,000 homes are estimated to have been destroyed, according to the Tulsa Historical Society and Museum.
However, only 26 death certificates were issued in 1921 for Black victims of the massacre, according to the city – 21 of which were reportedly buried in Oaklawn Cemetery.
After an excavation in the cemetery last year resulted in 19 exhumations, the city began a second excavation on October 26.
Since then, 26 burials have been found and four sets of remains have been exhumed and taken to an on-site osteology lab, Tulsa officials said.

Oaklawn Cemetery is one of four sites identified for the investigation. Others include Newblock Park, another area near Newblock Park and Rolling Oaks Memorial Gardens, according to the city website.
The investigation’s first phase involved the use of ground penetrating radar, which found evidence of “anomalies” at two areas of Oaklawn Cemetery, including the Original 18 site, officials said.
Tulsa judge allows 1921 race massacre lawsuit to move forward
Descendants of the Tulsa Race Massacre and leaders in Tulsa’s African American community are serving as part of a public oversight committee set up to serve in an advisory capacity during the investigation.
“The only way to move forward in our work to bring about reconciliation in Tulsa is by seeking the truth honestly,” Mayor G.T. Bynum says on the website. “As we open this investigation 101 years later, there are both unknowns and truths to uncover. But we are committed to exploring what happened in 1921 through a collective and transparent process - filling gaps in our city’s history, and providing healing and justice to our community.”

3 former Pennsylvania officers plead guilty in the shooting of an 8-year-old girl
By Zenebou Sylla and Kiely Westhoff, CNN
Published 6:02 PM EST, Fri November 11, 2022

 — 
Three former Pennsylvania police officers each pleaded guilty Thursday to 10 counts of reckless endangerment for their involvement in the death of an 8-year-old girl who was shot after she was leaving a high school football game with her family, according to a spokesperson from the Delaware County District Attorney’s Office.
Fanta Bility was killed in August 2021, when three police officers from Sharon Hill Borough fired shots which struck a car following an outbreak of gunfire as attendees were leaving the game, according to the Delaware County District Attorney Jack Stollsheimer.
“As we have endeavored to achieve justice in the midst of such a tragedy, my office has remained in close communication with the family to ensure that their feelings were heard and respected,” said Stollsheimer in a statement.
Police gunfire likely killed 8-year-old girl outside Pennsylvania football stadium, DA says
The District Attorney’s Office worked closely with the family to arrive at a conviction which “brings accountability” for Bility’s death, Stollsheimer said.
“Over this past year, the hurt caused by Sharon Hill Borough and its police department has overcome my family with tremendous grief,” Bility’s family said in a statement through spokesperson Dawn Chavous. “The agony we feel constantly reliving the loss of our dear Fanta who was just 8 years old when she was killed by Sharon Hill police officers, is impossible to describe with words.”
“Since her mother and siblings were witnesses to this tragic incident, they will have to live with that trauma imprinted in their memories for the rest of their lives,” the statement continues.
In addition to the reckless endangerment charges, former officers Brian Devaney, 42, Sean Dolan, 26, and Devon Smith were each originally charged with an additional one count of manslaughter and one count of involuntary manslaughter. The manslaughter charges were dropped as part of a plea deal negotiated by the district attorney, according to CNN affiliate WPVI.
“After much prayer and discussion with our family, we determined that it was in our best interest for the District Attorney to ensure that the police officers take responsibility for their actions, admit to their reckless conduct endangering many, and killing our Fanta,” the family statement added. “We pray that as a result of the police officers being held accountable, we can as a family and as a community, finally have some closure and begin the healing process,” the statement from Bility’s family adds.
3 Pennsylvania officers fired after being charged in the fatal shooting of 8-year-old Fanta Bility
All three officers were fired earlier this year after being charged in the fatal shooting.
In the statement, Bility’s family says they support the District Attorney’s plea agreement with the officers but believe Sharon Hill Borough should also be held accountable for what they describe as a failure to properly train officers before the use of deadly force.
“We need to ensure all officers are properly trained so no one ever has to experience the horror and tremendous loss and pain that we continue to feel on a daily basis,” the family statement reads.
CNN has reached out to attorneys representing Devaney, Dolan and Smith. A sentencing hearing for the three men is scheduled for January 12, 2023.

Banksy unveils mural in Ukrainian town liberated from Russians

 — 
Renowned street artist Banksy has unveiled his latest artwork in an Instagram post – a mural in the liberated Ukrainian town of Borodianka.
The artwork shows a female gymnast balancing on a pile of rubble on the side of a building damaged by Russian strikes.
The graffiti artist posted three images of the piece Friday on social media, with a simple caption reading “Borodyanka, Ukraine,” using an alternative spelling for the town’s name.
Speculation had been mounting that Banksy was in the war-torn country after a series of murals appeared in Borodianka, located about 35 miles northwest of the capital, Kyiv.
Borodianka was hit particularly hard by Russian airstrikes in the first few weeks of the conflict.

One artwork, not officially claimed by the artist, depicted a man being flipped during a judo match with a little boy.
Another showed two children using a metal tank trap as a seesaw.
Borodianka was hit particularly hard by Russian airstrikes at the start of the invasion of Ukraine in February, with many buildings reduced to piles of rubble by long-range attacks.
It was home to 13,000 people before the war, but most fled after Russia’s invasion. What was left of Borodianka, after intense shelling and devastating strikes, was then occupied by Russian forces, who moved in on February 28.

The town came back into Ukrainian control on April 1, and returning residents found their houses ransacked and shops pillaged with windows broken and contents stolen.
The letter “V” – a symbol used by Russia’s Eastern Military district in concert with the letter “Z,” an emblem for Moscow’s so-called “special military operation” – was found painted on buildings, vehicles and checkpoints.
The town has since been the focus of reconstruction efforts, with several tower blocks demolished as a result of damage caused by the fighting.

‘Power Slap’: UFC president launches new open-handed striking venture
By Ben Morse, CNN
Published 6:43 AM EST, Sat November 12, 2022

 — 
UFC president Dana White is getting into the slap game.
The longtime president of the UFC announced a new striking competition called Power Slap during a press conference on Friday.
The new venture will pit men and women competitors from around the world to showcase “power, technique and resolve.”
The sport features two opponents facing each other exchanging open-handed hits to the face one after another until one wins the match.
Alongside the new series, which is set to launch in early 2023, White announced a deal with TBS for an eight-part television series. Friday’s press release states competitors will vie to earn a place in “the cast house” and Power Slap rankings.
“The sport of slap fighting is about to go to a whole new level,” White said at the Power Slap press conference at Radio City Music Hall.
“The production level will be through the roof … everything about this thing is going to the next level.”
White is collaborating with former UFC CEO Lorenzo Fertitta and television producer Craig Piligian.
White added the series has been sanctioned by the Nevada State Athletic Commission (NSAC) – the first slap league to do so – with defined rules, rankings, weight classes and “extensive medical testing.”
“I’ve been working on this since 2017. I saw some footage of slap fighting on social media and I was instantly hooked. From the first day I saw it, I felt like this could be big. I knew what needed to be done to make it a real sport just like we did with MMA,” said White.
Last month, White put out an all-call via social media telling fans: “If you have ever professionally slapped, or think you can, email a video to our casting team.”
A coin toss will determine the option of whether or not the winner would like to slap or defend first. There will be a 30 second clock to deliver the slap, and another 30 seconds for recovery. The minimum number of rounds for each competition will be three.
Victory will be determined via knockout, TKO, or by points. Like boxing and MMA, Power Slap judging is based on a “10-point must system,” with a round winner scoring 10 points and the opponent scoring 9 or fewer.
According to the Power Slap website: “judging criteria is based on the striker’s effectiveness, as well as the defender’s reaction and recovery time.”
Striker fouls include “clubbing, stepping, illegal wind-up and delay of game.” Defender fouls include “flinching, blocking and delay of game.”
Warnings, point deduction, loss of strike, re-strike and disqualification can be adjudged if fouls are assessed.

Western lowland gorilla born at Fort Worth Zoo

 — 
A bouncing baby gorilla has been born at the Fort Worth Zoo in Texas.
The unnamed infant is just the second-ever western lowland gorilla born at the facility, according to a Facebook post.
The baby was born early on November 6 to parents Gracie and Elmo, the zoo says.
He likely weighs between 4 and 5 pounds, which is normal for newborn gorillas. But by the time he’s an adult, he might weigh as much as 500 pounds, according to the Smithsonian Zoo’s size estimates for western lowland gorillas.
Please don't lick this psychedelic toad, National Park Service warns
Gorillas fall into two species: western and eastern gorillas, each of which has two subspecies. The western lowland gorilla is the most widespread and numerous of the four subspecies, according to the World Wildlife Fund, although the exact size of the population is unknown. The large apes live in the dense rainforests of Cameroon, the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon and the Republic of Congo.
But even though the western lowland gorilla is the most numerous gorilla subspecies, it has still faced serious population decline over the last decades due to poaching and disease, says the World Wildlife Fund. The species is categorized as critically endangered by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature.
So far, the newborn gorilla is “staying close to his mother” while meeting other members of the Fort Worth Zoo’s gorilla troop, according to the Facebook post.
The unnamed baby was born early on Nov. 6 to parents Gracie and Elmo.

“The pair continues to bond but are also fully integrated into the troop, mimicking family dynamics in the wild,” the zoo said.
Visitors can catch a glimpse of the mother and baby at the zoo’s World of Primates exhibit. The facility has six gorillas, not counting the newborn, according to its website.

Divers uncover a surprising discovery near the wreck of the Titanic

CNN
 — 
The wreck of the Titanic sits in two parts at the bottom of the North Atlantic Ocean, slowly decaying nearly 4,000 meters (13,000 feet) below the surface, but it’s not alone. A sonar blip detected around 26 years ago has now revealed there’s much more to this underwater area than previously thought.
P.H. Nargeolet, a veteran Nautile submersible pilot and Titanic diver, originally picked up the blip on echo sounding equipment in 1996, but its origins have remained unknown.

In an expedition to the Titanic shipwreck earlier this year, Nargeolet and four other researchers went to the blip’s previously recorded location to search for the mysterious object it represented. Due to the blip’s magnitude, Nargeolet had believed he was looking for another shipwreck — he instead found a rocky reef, made up of various volcanic formations, and thriving with lobsters, deep-sea fish, sponges and several species of coral that could be thousands of years old.
“It is biologically fascinating. The animals that live there are very different to the animals that are found otherwise living in the abyssal ocean,” said Murray Roberts, a professor of applied marine biology and ecology at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland and one of the researchers on the expedition. “(Nargeolet) did a really important piece of scientific work. He thought it was a shipwreck, and it turned out, in my mind, even more amazing than a shipwreck.”
Spooky spots to explore from the US to Asia
The abyssal plain is a term used to describe the ocean floor at a water depth of 3,000 to 4,000 meters (around 12,000 feet), which makes up 60% of Earth’s surface, according to Roberts. It is thought to be a featureless, muddy seabed without much structure. On a few occasions, divers have observed rocky formations on the plain. Since the recent discovery near the Titanic, Roberts now believes such features might be more common than previously thought.
Rocky areas may also help explain the distances that sponges and corals travel across the ocean floor, which has always been a mystery to scientists. Within the muddy environment where they are typically observed, there are few hard surfaces for these species to latch onto in order to grow and reproduce.

“Sometimes they turn up in places where we think, ‘Well, how did they get there? They don’t live long enough to get there,” Roberts said. “But if there are more of these rocky places, these stepping stones, than we ever thought, I think it could help us understand the distribution of these species across the ocean.”

The researchers are currently working on analyzing images and videos taken of the reef during their dive, and they intend to share their findings to improve the scientific community’s collective knowledge of deep-sea life. Roberts also hopes to link this discovery to a wider Atlantic Ocean ecosystem project he leads, called iAtlantic, that will allow for further study and protection of the fragile ecosystem within the reef.

There is another sonar blip near the Titanic that Nargeolet is hoping to identify on a future expedition. It was recorded in the same survey he performed years ago, in between the wreck of the Titanic and the newly uncovered reef — now named the Nargeolet-Fanning Ridge after him and the 2022 expedition’s mission specialist Oisín Fanning. Nargeolet expects whatever it is to be even bigger than this reef.
OceanGate Expeditions and their foundation — which, along with Fanning, provided the financial support for Nargeolet’s dive this year — will continue its longitudinal research work of the Titanic and surrounding areas in 2023.
“The marine life … was so beautiful. It was really unbelievable, because I was never expecting to see that in my life,” Nargeolet said. “I’ll be very happy to continue to look at the Titanic.”

Nicole becomes post-tropical cyclone, brings rain to Northeast after leaving a trail of destruction in Florida
By Nouran Salahieh, CNN
Published 3:09 AM EST, Sat November 12, 2022

CNN
 — 
After wreaking havoc in Florida, Nicole weakened into a post-tropical cyclone, bringing severe thunderstorms to the Carolinas and Virginia Friday before striking the Northeast.
Nicole – the first hurricane to hit the US in the month of November in nearly 40 years – walloped coastal homes in Florida’s Daytona area early Thursday and left five people dead after hitting the state’s eastern coast as a Category 1 hurricane.
The storm’s remnants are now expected to track to the Northeast and eastern Canada through Saturday, with heavy rain and gusty winds spreading from the Mid-Atlantic and Ohio Valley to New England overnight, according to the National Hurricane Center.
Nicole kills at least 5 in Florida and leaves 'unprecedented' damage to Daytona-area coastline
Nicole is expected to produce an additional 1 to 3 inches of rain across parts of the Eastern seaboard through Saturday morning, before pushing off-shore and away from the Atlantic coast.
The central Appalachians and northern Mid-Atlantic areas, particularly in the Blue Ridge Mountains, were expected to see Isolated flash, urban and small stream flooding.
Heavy rain and isolated flooding are also expected across New England through early Saturday.
While many people in the Carolinas and Georgia were under wind advisories earlier Friday, areas of Massachusetts, New Jersey and New York remain under one until Saturday morning, according to the National Weather Service. Gusts of up to 50 mph were possible.
The system will continue to weaken as it moves northward Saturday, and its tropical moisture will be absorbed by a separate cold front, which delivered blizzard conditions across the northern Plains.
“The risk of excessive rainfall and localized flash flooding with this extratropical transition will continue to diminish through Saturday,” the prediction center said.

Destruction along Florida’s eastern coastline
As the storm moves away from the Sunshine State, the damage left behind in Florida’s Volusia County coast is clear to see.
Beachfront homes and hotels have collapsed into the ocean. At least 49 beachfront properties, including hotels and condos, have been deemed “unsafe,” according to county officials.
“The Volusia Coast has been devastated by hurricanes Ian and Nicole,” Volusia County Beach Safety Capt. A.J. Miller said in a video statement Friday. “Damage assessments from these two storms combined have totaled in the hundreds of millions of dollars with over 30 homes and two dozen hotels and condos that have been evacuated.”

Buildings in the area were battered by Hurricane Ian just weeks before Nicole’s arrival, and were further threatened by coastal erosion as incoming Nicole pushed rising ocean water onshore on top of exceptionally high tides.
When Nicole arrived, it tore through homes in Wilbur-By-The-Sea, a barrier island community off Daytona Beach.

Among the badly damaged structures on the island was Nina Lavigna’s home. She lost 33 years of memorabilia in the storm, Lavigna told CNN affiliate WESH.
Nicole during landfall ripped Lavigna’s bedrooms away from the rest of her house, leaving the home exposed to the ocean and badly damaged. In the rooms left standing, her granddaughters pink shoes could be seen among the rubble.
On Friday, Lavigna said she flagged down Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis as he toured the wreckage.
“I asked him if he could send us some help. Because we need some help here,” she said.
DeSantis said on social media the state is “committed to restoring our communities and beaches.”
“Florida’s Atlantic Coast has been hit hard by 2 storms in less than 2 months. Dozens of buildings have been condemned or destroyed by erosion,” the governor tweeted Thursday. The state “will use $20 million for emergency sand placement,” he said.

As residents navigate the storm’s aftermath, Miller warned there are still dangers on the beach as recovery efforts continue. The storm left a multitude of hazards residents must maneuver in the hurricane’s wake.
“The amount of destruction is unprecedented and the beach is littered with massive amounts of debris, both in the water and onshore,” Miller said.
At least five people were killed in the storm. In Florida’s Orange County, two people died after being “electrocuted by a downed power line,” the sheriff’s office said in a news release. Another two deaths are being investigated as possibly storm-related following a fatal car accident, according to Orange County Mayor Jerry Demings.
Also killed was a 68-year-old Port Canaveral man who had been on a yacht early Thursday morning as it was “being battered by the waves and the dock,” the Cocoa Police Department said.
CNN’s Haley Brink, Derek Van Dam, Theresa Waldrop, Melissa Alonso and Caroll Alvarado contributed to this report.

Actor Alec Baldwin alleges wrongdoing against ‘Rust’ film crew members in lawsuit
By Chloe Melas, CNN
Updated 10:32 PM EST, Fri November 11, 2022

CNN
 — 
Actor Alec Baldwin on Friday filed a lawsuit in California against several individuals associated with the “Rust” film, according to a cross-complaint obtained by CNN.
Cinematographer Halyna Hutchins was fatally shot by the actor last October during a rehearsal for a scene for the movie, which was being filmed near Santa Fe, New Mexico.
The lawsuit is the first legal action in which Baldwin alleges wrongdoing against someone in relation to the shooting.
Baldwin, who is listed as a defendant in a 2021 lawsuit by a “Rust” script supervisor, filed the cross-complaint against the production’s armorer Hannah Gutierrez Reed, assistant director David Halls, armorer assistant Seth Kenney, the prop weapon and ammunition supply store company Kenney owns, and prop master Sarah Zachry.
Alec Baldwin reaches settlement with Halyna Hutchins' family
“More than anyone else on that set, Baldwin has been wrongfully viewed as the perpetrator of this tragedy. By these Cross-Claims, Baldwin seeks to clear his name and hold Cross-Defendants accountable for their misconduct,” the cross-complaint says.
“This tragedy happened because live bullets were delivered to the set and loaded into the gun, Gutierrez Reed failed to check the bullets or the gun carefully, Halls failed to check the gun carefully and yet announced the gun was safe before handing it to Baldwin, and Zachry failed to disclose that Gutierrez Reed had been acting recklessly off set and was a safety risk to those around her,” the complaint alleges, adding Baldwin was unaware of those facts, but the cross-defendants knew.
“These Cross Defendants are professionals who owed a duty to those on set, including Baldwin, to keep the set safe. Everyone on set, including Baldwin, expected and trusted them to do so. Hutchins never would have instructed Baldwin to point the gun in her direction and pull back the hammer if she thought the slightest possibility existed that it was loaded; Baldwin, who shared the same state of mind as Hutchins in that critical moment, wouldn’t have done so under such conditions,” the lawsuit claims.
Ten months after the 'Rust' shooting, Alec Baldwin says he still thinks about it every day
Baldwin is seeking “compensatory, nominal, statutory, and punitive damages” through a jury trial, litigation-related expenses, and other relief to be determined by the Los Angeles County Superior Court, the cross-complaint says.
In an August 2022 interview with CNN, Baldwin placed responsibility for the film set tragedy on Gutierrez Reed and Halls, who handed him the gun.
Jason Bowles, attorney for Gutierrez Reed, told CNN on Friday: “He was the one who shot Halyna, and it’s his fault, no one else’s.”
Asked in August for comment, Halls’ attorney accused Baldwin of deflecting blame onto others.
Kenney’s attorneys have previously denied responsibility in the shooting.
CNN reached out Friday to attorneys representing Halls and Kenney for comment on the lawsuit. CNN is seeking contact details for Zachary’s attorney.

Kherson, Ukraine
CNN
 — 
For eight months, residents of the Ukrainian city of Kherson have been living under brutal Russian occupation. But on Friday, Ukrainian forces swept into the city and Russian troops retreated to the east.
The residents have no water, no internet connection and little power. But as a CNN crew entered the city on Saturday, the mood was euphoric.
As the crew filmed live in Kherson’s central square, some in the crowd of locals sang the national anthem while others shouted “Slava Ukrayini!” – glory to Ukraine, a patriotic greeting.
“We feel free, we are not slaves, we are Ukrainians,” resident Olga told CNN.
Locals have also been climbing onto the tops of the buildings, including the cinema, in the square to erect Ukrainian flags. Soldiers driving through are greeted with cheers and asked to sign autographs on flags.
Russia's withdrawal from Kherson is a humiliating setback. Here's what it means for the war
Back when Russian troops rolled in at the beginning of the war, this was a city that tried to resist: people were taken away, tortured, disappeared, residents said.
“We were terrified by [the] Russian army, we were terrified by soldiers that can come any moment in our house, in our home – just open the door, like they are living here, and steal, kidnap, torture,” Olga said.
But now, people flock to the central square in the newly liberated city, wrapped in Ukrainian flags, singing and chanting “Freedom for Ukraine.”
“Everyone here is out celebrating in the square here. People are wearing the Ukrainian flag, they’re hugging the soldiers, they’ve come out to see what it’s like to have freedom,” Robertson said.
Katerina described the liberation as the “best day” of her life after eight months under Russian occupation. “Our town is free, my street is free,” she told CNN.
Another local resident named Andrew said he was so glad to see Ukrainian soldiers.
“I think lots of people were killed here. We just don’t know that yet,” he said of the period under occupation.
A Ukrainian Special Forces soldier, who gave his name only as Daniel, told CNN how his unit was the first to arrive in Kherson. “My commander put the flag on the top of the building,” he said.
“It was a real blast for us, finally. Before the 11th [of November], it was five days of hard work, real hard work. Ukrainian soldiers, as always, just confirmed again that they are stronger than the Russians.”
He added that the civilians in Kherson are the “real heroes” for lasting so long under Russian occupation. “I can’t imagine how happy they are right now,” he said.
The CNN team appeared to be the first international journalists to reach Kherson city center since it changed hands in the past 48 hours.
On Friday, Russia announced it had withdrawn from the west bank of the Dnipro River in the strategic southern region of Kherson, leaving the regional capital of the same name and surrounding areas to the Ukrainians.
The retreat represents a major blow for Putin’s war effort in Ukraine. Kherson was the only Ukrainian regional capital that Russian forces had captured since February’s invasion. Their withdrawal east across the Dnipro cedes large swathes of land that Russia has occupied since the early days of the war, and that Putin had formally declared as Russian territory just five weeks ago.

“It was a really hard time for everyone. Every Ukrainian family waited for our soldiers, for our army,” another Kherson resident told CNN on Saturday, recalling Russia’s months-long occupation.
The woman said it felt “amazing” to see Ukrainian troops in Kherson.
“We felt every day your support, thank you so much,” the woman added, before hugging Robertson.
Efforts to return the city to ‘normal life’
Ukrainian authorities are working to return the city to “normal life,” the head of the regional military administration, Yaroslav Yanushevich, said Saturday in a video message, adding that the city, oblast and district military administrations had arrived in the city and started duties.
“The national police and the security service of Ukraine have also taken up their duties. The State Service for Emergency Situations is clearing mines. We are working for the return of the city to normal life,” Yanushevich said.

About 200 police officers are currently working in the city, Ukraine’s National Police said in a statement Saturday.
“Roadblocks have been set up around and in the territory of Kherson. The regional police continue to record the crimes of the Russian occupiers,” the statement reads.
The main threat is from mines, police said, adding that explosives technicians were working on their detection and disposal. “One of the police sappers was injured today during the demining of an administrative building in Kherson,” police said.
Residents who have left Kherson are advised “not to rush to return until stabilization measures are completed,” police said.
Speaking Saturday on the next steps for the Ukrainian military, CNN military analyst Cedric Leighton said: “This is going to be a major urban operation. What you are going to see is a methodical operation to clear buildings of potential booby traps and mines.
“Another thing that the Ukrainians will have to do is they’re going to have to move their systems forward so that they can counter any possible Russian artillery that is going to be on the eastern bank of the Dnipro River.
“You can see that the Ukrainians have moved to that river bank, they are now controlling that area, they will have to mop up some remaining Russian forces that did not make it out of the west bank of the Dnipro River. But those that are there will probably either surrender or in essence be eliminated from the fight.”
People gathered in Maidan Square to celebrate the liberation of Kherson, in the capital, Kyiv, on Friday.

On Friday evening, Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky posted a nighttime video of celebrations in the city, where a crowd was waving flags and chanting “ZSU,” the Ukrainian acronym for the armed forces.
Earlier that day, the Ukrainian military’s southern operational command said Russian forces had been “urgently loading into boats that seem suitable for crossing and trying to escape” across the river.
It was unclear whether all Russian troops had left Kherson and the wider region. Serhiy Khlan, a member of Ukraine’s Kherson regional council, said the city was “almost under the control of the Armed Forces of Ukraine” but cautioned that some Russian troops might have remained behind in civilian clothing.
He warned that many Russian troops “threw away their military uniforms, and are now hiding with civilian clothes on.”

The lawsuit over Hawaii’s Red Hill water contamination crisis has drawn in more than 100 new plaintiffs
By Paradise Afshar, CNN
Published 9:25 PM EST, Fri November 11, 2022

 — 
More than 100 new plaintiffs affected by water contamination at Red Hill Bulk Fuel Storage Facility in Hawaii have been included in a lawsuit against the United States government.
The lawsuit was originally filed earlier this year with the US District Court for the District of Hawaii, and included the names of 10 plaintiffs.
The most recent update to the document, which was filed on Thursday, includes the name of more than 100 new plaintiffs, including civilians, who claim they suffered physically, emotionally and financially after a series of failures last November resulted in a fuel leak at the facility.
“The once-healthy adults and children have been treated — and hospitalized — for seizures, gastrointestinal disorders, neurological issues, vestibular dysfunction, brain injury, impaired hearing, renal complications, skin tumors, lung damage, liver damage, kidney lesions, burns, rashes, lesions, thyroid abnormalities, migraines, baby loss, and other maladies,” the complaint stated.
A US Navy investigation found about 20,000 gallons of fuel leaked into a nearby well families relied on for water.
The Navy shut down its Red Hill well after reports came in of people living on base suffering nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headaches and skin-related problems. Testing revealed petroleum hydrocarbons and vapors in the water, the Navy said at the time.
Navy finds series of failures led to fuel leak at Hawaii military facility that sickened families
Through a command investigation, the Navy found inadequate responses to the May 2021 spill and the November spill. It also found the risk could have been identified with proper training and drills following the original leak.
In March, the Defense Department announced it would defuel and permanently close the facility by August 2027. The leak, its ensuing environmental damage, and harm to surrounding communities are part of what pushed the department to make the decision.
In response to an inquiry about the updated lawsuit, the Defense Health Agency said in a statement it “is committed to the health and safety of our patients.”
There are currently plans to open a dedicated clinic for patients with symptoms related to fuel exposure in December, Whitney Trimble, chief of public affairs for the Defense Health Agency Region Indo-Pacific, told CNN Friday in the statement.
“Because there are very limited studies available on the long term health effects of exposure to petroleum products, DHAR-IP is working closely with experts from the Department of Defense, Hawaii Department of Health, and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to closely track the long term health effects of exposure to fuel-contaminated water, so we can better serve patients affected by the Red Hill contamination,” Trimble said.
The updated complaint comes on the heels of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Hawaii Department of Health releasing the results of a survey of water contamination in the US Navy’s Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam drinking water system.
The survey, which had 986 participants, was conducted in September and found about 80% of respondents reported health symptoms in the previous 30 days, and 65% expressed high or very high confidence the symptoms were related to the water contamination incident.
According to the survey the most commonly reported symptoms were headaches, anxiety, dry or itchy skin, fatigue and difficulty sleeping.
Respondents also “overwhelmingly expressed concern and frustration with communication, transparency, and trust.”
CNN’s Oren Liebermann contributed to this report.

Kherson, Ukraine
CNN
 — 
For eight months, residents of the Ukrainian city of Kherson have been living under brutal Russian occupation. But on Friday, Ukrainian forces swept into the city and Russian troops retreated to the east.
The residents have no water, no internet connection and little power. But as a CNN crew entered the city on Saturday, the mood was euphoric.
As the crew filmed live in Kherson’s central square, some in the crowd of locals sang the national anthem while others shouted “Slava Ukrayini!” – glory to Ukraine, a patriotic greeting.
“We feel free, we are not slaves, we are Ukrainians,” resident Olga told CNN.
Locals have also been climbing onto the tops of the buildings, including the cinema, in the square to erect Ukrainian flags. Soldiers driving through are greeted with cheers and asked to sign autographs on flags.
Russia's withdrawal from Kherson is a humiliating setback. Here's what it means for the war
Back when Russian troops rolled in at the beginning of the war, this was a city that tried to resist: people were taken away, tortured, disappeared, residents said.
“We were terrified by [the] Russian army, we were terrified by soldiers that can come any moment in our house, in our home – just open the door, like they are living here, and steal, kidnap, torture,” Olga said.
But now, people flock to the central square in the newly liberated city, wrapped in Ukrainian flags, singing and chanting “Freedom for Ukraine.”
“Everyone here is out celebrating in the square here. People are wearing the Ukrainian flag, they’re hugging the soldiers, they’ve come out to see what it’s like to have freedom,” Robertson said.
Katerina described the liberation as the “best day” of her life after eight months under Russian occupation. “Our town is free, my street is free,” she told CNN.
Another local resident named Andrew said he was so glad to see Ukrainian soldiers.
“I think lots of people were killed here. We just don’t know that yet,” he said of the period under occupation.
A Ukrainian Special Forces soldier, who gave his name only as Daniel, told CNN how his unit was the first to arrive in Kherson. “My commander put the flag on the top of the building,” he said.
“It was a real blast for us, finally. Before the 11th [of November], it was five days of hard work, real hard work. Ukrainian soldiers, as always, just confirmed again that they are stronger than the Russians.”
He added that the civilians in Kherson are the “real heroes” for lasting so long under Russian occupation. “I can’t imagine how happy they are right now,” he said.
The CNN team appeared to be the first international journalists to reach Kherson city center since it changed hands in the past 48 hours.
On Friday, Russia announced it had withdrawn from the west bank of the Dnipro River in the strategic southern region of Kherson, leaving the regional capital of the same name and surrounding areas to the Ukrainians.
The retreat represents a major blow for Putin’s war effort in Ukraine. Kherson was the only Ukrainian regional capital that Russian forces had captured since February’s invasion. Their withdrawal east across the Dnipro cedes large swathes of land that Russia has occupied since the early days of the war, and that Putin had formally declared as Russian territory just five weeks ago.

“It was a really hard time for everyone. Every Ukrainian family waited for our soldiers, for our army,” another Kherson resident told CNN on Saturday, recalling Russia’s months-long occupation.
The woman said it felt “amazing” to see Ukrainian troops in Kherson.
“We felt every day your support, thank you so much,” the woman added, before hugging Robertson.
Efforts to return the city to ‘normal life’
Ukrainian authorities are working to return the city to “normal life,” the head of the regional military administration, Yaroslav Yanushevich, said Saturday in a video message, adding that the city, oblast and district military administrations had arrived in the city and started duties.
“The national police and the security service of Ukraine have also taken up their duties. The State Service for Emergency Situations is clearing mines. We are working for the return of the city to normal life,” Yanushevich said.

About 200 police officers are currently working in the city, Ukraine’s National Police said in a statement Saturday.
“Roadblocks have been set up around and in the territory of Kherson. The regional police continue to record the crimes of the Russian occupiers,” the statement reads.
The main threat is from mines, police said, adding that explosives technicians were working on their detection and disposal. “One of the police sappers was injured today during the demining of an administrative building in Kherson,” police said.
Residents who have left Kherson are advised “not to rush to return until stabilization measures are completed,” police said.
Speaking Saturday on the next steps for the Ukrainian military, CNN military analyst Cedric Leighton said: “This is going to be a major urban operation. What you are going to see is a methodical operation to clear buildings of potential booby traps and mines.
“Another thing that the Ukrainians will have to do is they’re going to have to move their systems forward so that they can counter any possible Russian artillery that is going to be on the eastern bank of the Dnipro River.
“You can see that the Ukrainians have moved to that river bank, they are now controlling that area, they will have to mop up some remaining Russian forces that did not make it out of the west bank of the Dnipro River. But those that are there will probably either surrender or in essence be eliminated from the fight.”
People gathered in Maidan Square to celebrate the liberation of Kherson, in the capital, Kyiv, on Friday.

On Friday evening, Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky posted a nighttime video of celebrations in the city, where a crowd was waving flags and chanting “ZSU,” the Ukrainian acronym for the armed forces.
Earlier that day, the Ukrainian military’s southern operational command said Russian forces had been “urgently loading into boats that seem suitable for crossing and trying to escape” across the river.
It was unclear whether all Russian troops had left Kherson and the wider region. Serhiy Khlan, a member of Ukraine’s Kherson regional council, said the city was “almost under the control of the Armed Forces of Ukraine” but cautioned that some Russian troops might have remained behind in civilian clothing.
He warned that many Russian troops “threw away their military uniforms, and are now hiding with civilian clothes on.”

Man in Scotland confirmed to be US rape suspect, Scottish court rules
By Alex Hardie, CNN
Published 8:10 PM EST, Fri November 11, 2022
The defendant denies he is Nicholas Rossi, who the US is seeking for trial in Utah on a charge of rape

CNN
 — 
A man in Scotland is a rape suspect wanted in the United States, a Scottish court ruled Friday, despite the man’s claims that he is not the person authorities are looking for and that he never visited the US in his life.
An Edinburgh Sheriff’s Court judge said that that the man claiming to be “Arthur Knight” among other aliases, is in fact Nicholas Rossi, whom the US is seeking extradition to face trial in Utah on a charge of rape, the ruling said.
An Interpol Red Notice – which is a request for law enforcement worldwide to provisionally arrest a person – was issued by the US for Rossi on October 4, 2021.
Rossi is wanted to stand trial for alleged felony rape charges in Utah County, according to a press release from county attorney David O. Leavitt. The alleged crimes occurred in 2008, according to a Utah Department of Public Safety press release.
That is not the only charge against him in the US. In September, Salt Lake County District Attorney’s office charged Rossi with a separate charge of felony rape stemming from a 2008 incident, according to a probable cause affidavit.
CNN has reached out to the defendant’s lawyer for comment.
Fingerprint experts compared prints provided by the US extradition request with those taken from the man claiming to be Knight and “positively identified the impressions of two fingers,” the court document said.
According to the document, the man explained the match by saying that the US obtained his fingerprints through a health service worker when he was hospitalized last year – a claim that Sheriff Norman McFadyen dismissed as “unsupported by any evidence,” “scandalous,” and “implausible and fanciful.”
McFadyen wrote that he also compared photos of tattoos provided by the US extradition request with witness descriptions of the man’s tattoos, concluding that “there is powerful evidence of similarity of quite distinctive tattoos being seen on Mr Knight which resemble in detail the distinctive tattoos on the photographs of Nicholas Rossie.”
According to the court document, the man claiming to be Knight said he had been tattooed while in a coma in the hospital – an explanation also rejected by McFadyen as “implausible and fanciful.”
McFadyen heard testimony from two intensive care staff at a Glasgow hospital where the man was treated for serious Covid-19 complications last year, the court document said. He also heard testimony from a police constable, detective constables, a registrar, a doctor, the man in question and his wife, Miranda Knight.
“Mr. Knight is indeed Nicholas Rossie [sic], the person sought for extradition by the United States,” said McFadyen in his conclusion, noting that he would have been prepared to accept the fingerprint match alone as sufficient evidence.
The decision did not issue any kind of conclusion as to whether Rossi should be extradited or whether he is guilty of the US allegations.

Biden arrives in Cambodia looking to counter China’s growing influence in Southeast Asia
By Betsy Klein and Phil Mattingly, CNN

CNN
 — 
President Joe Biden underscored the US partnership with Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries on Saturday as “the heart of my administration’s Indo-Pacific strategy” as he seeks to counter China’s growing influence ahead of a high-stakes meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping set for Monday.
The weekend of meetings in Cambodia comes ahead of the highly anticipated Group of 20 summit next week in Indonesia where Biden will meet with Xi for the first time in person since he took office. The ASEAN meetings – along with Sunday’s East Asia Summit, which is also being held in Phnom Penh – will be a chance for the president to speak with US allies before sitting down with Xi.
In remarks to the summit, Biden announced “another critical step” toward building on the group’s progress as he detailed the launch of the US-ASEAN Comprehensive Strategic Partnership, which, he said, “will tackle the biggest issues of our time, from climate to health security, defend against the significant threats to rule based order and to threats to the rule of law, and to build an Indo-Pacific that’s free and open, stable and prosperous, resilient and secure.” He touted existing US financial commitments to ASEAN as he noted a budget request for $850 million in assistance for Southeast Asia.
“This is my third trip, my third summit – second in person – and it’s testament to the importance the United States places in our relationship with ASEAN and our commitment to ASEAN’s centrality. ASEAN is the heart of my administration’s Indo-Pacific strategy. And we continue to strengthen our commitment to work in lockstep with an empowered, unified ASEAN,” Biden said in brief opening remarks as the summit began.
The president’s first order of business in Cambodia was a bilateral meeting with Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen as he looks to build on a summit between Biden and ASEAN leaders in Washington earlier this year.
Biden, national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters aboard Air Force One, “was intent on elevating our engagement in the Indo-Pacific” from the start of his presidency, and his attendance at the ASEAN and East Asia summits this weekend will highlight his work so far, including the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework announced earlier this year and security partnership efforts.
“He’s coming into this set of summits with that record of accomplishment and purpose behind him, and he wants to be able to use the next 36 hours to build on that foundation to take American engagement forward, and also to deliver a series of concrete, practical initiatives,” Sullivan said.
As major powers meet in Asia, the rest of the world is pressed to pick a side
Among those practical initiatives, Sullivan noted, are new ones on maritime cooperation, digital connectivity and economic investment. Biden is set to launch a new maritime domain effort “that focuses on using radio frequencies from commercial satellites to be able to track dark shipping, illegal and unregulated fishing, and also to improve the capacity of the countries of the region to respond to disasters and humanitarian crises,” Sullivan said.
Biden will also highlight a “forward-deployed posture” toward regional defense, Sullivan added, to show that the US is on the front foot in terms of security cooperation.
During his remarks, Biden also pointed to a new US-ASEAN electric vehicle infrastructure initiative.
“We’re gonna work together to develop an integrated electric vehicle ecosystem in Southeast Asia, enabling the region to pursue clean energy, economic development, and ambitious emissions reductions targets,” he said of the initiative.
There will also be a focus on Myanmar and discussions on coordination “to continue to impose costs and raise pressure on the junta,” which seized power from the country’s democratically elected government in a February 2021 coup.

Meetings with allies
While in Phnom Penh, Biden will be meeting with the leaders of Japan and South Korea on Sunday following multiple weapons tests by North Korea, Sullivan said. The meeting is notable given the historic tensions between Japan and South Korea, and the relationship between the two staunch US allies has been one that Biden has attempted to bridge.
Is it time to accept North Korea is a nuclear power?
The Japanese and the South Koreans find themselves united in concern about Kim Jong Un’s missile tests, as well as the prospect of a seventh nuclear weapons test. North Korea has ramped up its tests this year, having carried out missile tests on 32 days in 2022, according to a CNN count. That’s compared to just eight in 2021 and four in 2020, with the latest launch coming on Wednesday.
Sullivan suggested the trilateral meeting will not lead to specific deliverables, but rather, enhanced security cooperation amid a range of threats.
The trio of world leaders, Sullivan told reporters, will “be able to discuss broader security issues in the Indo-Pacific and also, specifically, the threats posed by North Korea’s missile and nuclear programs.”
Sullivan said Thursday that the administration is concerned about the North Koreans conducting a seventh nuclear test but can’t say if it will come during the weekend of meetings.
“Our concern still remains real. Whether it happens in the next week or not, I can’t say,” Sullivan said earlier this week. “We are also concerned about further potential long-range missile tests in addition to the possibility of a nuclear test. And so, we’ll be watching carefully for both of those.”
Looking ahead to the G20 and Xi Jinping
But the Monday meeting with Xi in Bali, Indonesia, will undoubtedly hang over the summits in Cambodia, and will be part of those trilateral conversations.
“One thing that President Biden certainly wants to do with our closest allies is preview what he intends to do, and also ask the leaders of (South Korea) and Japan, ‘what would you like me to raise? What do you want me to go in with?’” Sullivan said, adding that it “will be a topic but it will not be the main event of the trilateral.”
Biden and Xi have spoken by phone five times since the president entered the White House. They traveled extensively together, both in China and the United States, when both were serving as their country’s vice president.
Both enter Monday’s meeting on the back of significant political events. Biden fared better than expected in US midterm elections and Xi was elevated to an unprecedented third term by the Chinese Communist Party.
US officials declined to speculate on how the two leaders’ political situations might affect the dynamic of their meeting.
The high-stakes bilateral meeting between Biden and Xi will center on “sharpening” each leader’s understanding of the other’s priorities, Sullivan told reporters.
That includes the issue of Taiwan, which Beijing claims. Biden has vowed in the past to use US military force to defend the island from invasion. The issue is among the most contentious between Biden and Xi.
Biden will also raise the issue of North Korea, with an emphasis on the critical role China can play in managing what is an acute threat to the region, Sullivan said.
North Korea Nuclear Timeline Fast Facts
Biden has repeatedly raised the issue in his calls with Xi up to this point, but Sullivan underscored the US view that China plays a critical role – and one that should be viewed within its own self-interest.
“If North Korea keeps going down this road, it will simply mean further enhanced American military and security presence in the region,” Sullivan said. “And so (China) has an interest in playing a constructive role in restraining North Korea’s worst tendencies. Whether they choose to do so or not is of course up to them.”
Sullivan said Biden will detail his position on the issue, “which is that North Korea represents a threat not just to the United States, not just to (South Korea) and Japan, but to peace and stability across the entire region.”
Sullivan suggested the meeting will focus on a better understanding of positions on a series of critical issues, but is not likely to result in any major breakthroughs or dramatic shifts in the relationship.
Instead, “it’s about the leaders coming to a better understanding and then tasking their teams” to continue to work through those issues, Sullivan told reporters aboard Air Force One as Biden traveled to Cambodia.
The meeting, set to take place on the sidelines of the G-20 summit, was the result of “several weeks of intensive” discussions between the two sides, Sullivan said, and is viewed by Biden as the start of a series of engagements between the leaders and their teams.

NBA’s Miami Heat to terminate relationship with FTX, will get new arena name

 — 
The NBA’s Miami Heat and Miami-Dade County have terminated their relationship with bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange FTX and will search for a new naming rights partner for their arena in downtown Miami.
The announcement came after the FTX group earlier on Friday filed for bankruptcy in the United States and its CEO resigned, marking a stunning downfall for one of the biggest and most powerful players in the crypto industry.
The sudden decline of one of the largest crypto exchanges could rattle the sports industry
Miami-Dade County and Miami Heat said in a joint statement Friday night that the reports about FTX are “extremely disappointing” and that they will work together to find a new naming rights partner for the arena, which was only renamed as FTX Arena last year.
Like other crypto companies, FTX has invested heavily in sports sponsorships. FTX had reportedly inked a reported $135 million, 19-year deal to rename the Miami arena in June 2021.
Los Angeles' Staples Center is becoming the Crypto.com Arena
Also, Major League Baseball struck a five-year deal in 2021 to name FTX as its official cryptocurrency exchange. FTX is also the official cryptocurrency exchange partner of the Mercedes-AMG Petronas Formula One Team.
Even college sports has ties to FTX, with the University of California, Berkeley, signing a $17.5 million, 10-year naming rights partnership in 2021 for the school’s football stadium.
CNN’s Jennifer Korn contributed to this report.

A passenger with box cutters prompted a Frontier Airlines flight to make an emergency landing in Atlanta, airline says
Tina Burnside, Hannah Sarisohn and Emma Tucker, CNN • Updated 13th November 2022
Facebook
Twitter
Email
(CNN) — A Frontier Airlines passenger necessitated an emergency landing and was later taken into custody Friday night after he was found with a box cutter, according to an airline spokesperson.
A second box cutter was later found in the passenger's carry-on luggage, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) told CNN on Saturday afternoon.
Frontier Airlines Flight 1761 from Cincinnati to Tampa was diverted to Atlanta after the passenger was seen with the box cutter, spokesperson Jennifer De La Cruz told CNN in a statement.
""The aircraft landed safely in Atlanta and the passenger in question was taken into custody by Atlanta law enforcement,"" De La Cruz said.
There were no injuries to passengers or crew members, according to the airline.
All passengers left the plane and were provided overnight hotel accommodations in Atlanta. A new flight was scheduled for Saturday morning to take them to Tampa.
Agents failed to follow protocol, TSA says
The TSA said in a statement on Sunday it reviewed Friday's incident and found its security checkpoint agents at Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport failed to adhere to protocol when they discovered a box cutter in the man's carry-on luggage, which later caused the diversion when he allegedly threatened passengers mid-flight.
The person in custody, who has not yet been identified, went through the physical screening after presenting agents with a temporary Ohio driver's license. The traveler was carrying two backpacks and additional loose items through security, the TSA said.
The agency said the agents did not fully use the technology at their disposal, which would have identified the box cutters inside the man's carry-on luggage, nor did they follow protocol when they returned the removable ""visible blades"" back to the passenger after an inspection.
The man's luggage was scanned ""using CT technology,"" which the TSA says creates a 3-D image that can be rotated 360 degrees for further inspection.
""Following review of the incident, including closed-circuit television (CCTV), the image review capabilities of the CT were not fully used,"" the agency said.
""The box cutters were not identified by the CT operator, but his property was identified for a further search. During the search, one box cutter was discovered. The visible blades were removed from the box cutter and provided back to the passenger,"" TSA's statement continued.
This is contrary to the standard operating procedure, according to the TSA, which requires that blades be placed in checked bags or ""voluntarily abandoned.""
The man's backpack, containing the other box cutter and the rest of the man's property, was screened for explosives, but the box cutter was not discovered at that time, TSA said.
The employees involved in the incident have been placed in a ""training status"" for remediation on CT image review and search procedures, according to the statement.
The agency said it will conduct ""shift briefs"" on the incident for all Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport and State of Kentucky employees, as well as schedule national and statewide trainings on technology tools and prohibited items.
Passenger alerted flight crew to risk
Lillian Hoffman, who was on board the plane, told CNN affiliate WLWT that she alerted the flight crew to the armed man after being made aware of him by another passenger.
""So, I went up and talked to the flight attendants at the front of the airplane and let them know like this guy has a box knife, and he's been telling us that he wants to stab people,"" Hoffman said.
The US Attorney's Office has taken the lead on investigating the situation, according to the TSA.
""TSA has started an internal review of the incident by viewing CCTV, airport security checkpoint processes/operations and will continue to provide updates as they are available. TSA can confirm that blades are prohibited in the cabin, but allowed in checked luggage,"" according to the statement on Saturday.
The Atlanta Police Department directed all questions about the incident to the FBI when contacted by CNN.
CNN's Hannah Sarisohn contributed to this report.

The oldest living person in the US just turned 115
By Zoe Sottile, CNN
Published 3:02 AM EST, Sat November 12, 2022
Bessie Hendricks (center), the oldest living person in the US, celebrated her 115th birthday on November 7th.

 — 
Bring out the candles – 115 of them.
Bessie Hendricks, the oldest living person in the United States, has celebrated yet another turn around the sun. The Iowa supercentenarian turned 115 on November 7, according to CNN affiliate KCCI.
The world's oldest person is a French nun who enjoys chocolate and wine
Hendricks was born in 1907. Her lifetime has seen 21 presidents, two world wars, and the sinking of the Titanic.
In addition to being the oldest living person in the United States, she is also the fourth-oldest living person in the world, according to the Gerontology Research Group, which records and certifies supercentenarians (people who have lived to be older than 110).
Hendricks celebrated her 115th birthday alongside her three children at Shady Oaks Care Center, according to KCCI.
“I don’t know how you put it into words,” said her daughter, Joan Schaffer, according to KCCI. Schaffer turned 90 the day before her mother’s 115th birthday. “It’s marvelous that we still have her.”
Hendricks’ children described her as a hard-working, caring mother. Hendricks’ own mother died when she was just 13 years old, according to KCCI.
Currently, the title for oldest living person belongs to Lucile Randon, a 118-year old French nun, says the Gerontology Research Group. The oldest person ever recorded was another Frenchwoman, Jeanne Louise Calment, who lived to be over 122 years old, according to the Guinness World Records. Calment died in 1997.

My son has been asking for a dress. I finally decided to just get him dresses despite being afraid he’d get teased by other kids. Today, the boy next door asked why he was wearing a dress, I said “he wanted one” and he said “okay” then they continued to play. The kids are alright

Divers uncover a surprising discovery near the wreck of the Titanic

CNN
 — 
The wreck of the Titanic sits in two parts at the bottom of the North Atlantic Ocean, slowly decaying nearly 4,000 meters (13,000 feet) below the surface, but it’s not alone. A sonar blip detected around 26 years ago has now revealed there’s much more to this underwater area than previously thought.
P.H. Nargeolet, a veteran Nautile submersible pilot and Titanic diver, originally picked up the blip on echo sounding equipment in 1996, but its origins have remained unknown.

In an expedition to the Titanic shipwreck earlier this year, Nargeolet and four other researchers went to the blip’s previously recorded location to search for the mysterious object it represented. Due to the blip’s magnitude, Nargeolet had believed he was looking for another shipwreck — he instead found a rocky reef, made up of various volcanic formations, and thriving with lobsters, deep-sea fish, sponges and several species of coral that could be thousands of years old.
“It is biologically fascinating. The animals that live there are very different to the animals that are found otherwise living in the abyssal ocean,” said Murray Roberts, a professor of applied marine biology and ecology at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland and one of the researchers on the expedition. “(Nargeolet) did a really important piece of scientific work. He thought it was a shipwreck, and it turned out, in my mind, even more amazing than a shipwreck.”
Spooky spots to explore from the US to Asia
The abyssal plain is a term used to describe the ocean floor at a water depth of 3,000 to 4,000 meters (around 12,000 feet), which makes up 60% of Earth’s surface, according to Roberts. It is thought to be a featureless, muddy seabed without much structure. On a few occasions, divers have observed rocky formations on the plain. Since the recent discovery near the Titanic, Roberts now believes such features might be more common than previously thought.
Rocky areas may also help explain the distances that sponges and corals travel across the ocean floor, which has always been a mystery to scientists. Within the muddy environment where they are typically observed, there are few hard surfaces for these species to latch onto in order to grow and reproduce.

“Sometimes they turn up in places where we think, ‘Well, how did they get there? They don’t live long enough to get there,” Roberts said. “But if there are more of these rocky places, these stepping stones, than we ever thought, I think it could help us understand the distribution of these species across the ocean.”

The researchers are currently working on analyzing images and videos taken of the reef during their dive, and they intend to share their findings to improve the scientific community’s collective knowledge of deep-sea life. Roberts also hopes to link this discovery to a wider Atlantic Ocean ecosystem project he leads, called iAtlantic, that will allow for further study and protection of the fragile ecosystem within the reef.

There is another sonar blip near the Titanic that Nargeolet is hoping to identify on a future expedition. It was recorded in the same survey he performed years ago, in between the wreck of the Titanic and the newly uncovered reef — now named the Nargeolet-Fanning Ridge after him and the 2022 expedition’s mission specialist Oisín Fanning. Nargeolet expects whatever it is to be even bigger than this reef.
OceanGate Expeditions and their foundation — which, along with Fanning, provided the financial support for Nargeolet’s dive this year — will continue its longitudinal research work of the Titanic and surrounding areas in 2023.
“The marine life … was so beautiful. It was really unbelievable, because I was never expecting to see that in my life,” Nargeolet said. “I’ll be very happy to continue to look at the Titanic.”

Trump mounts anti-McConnell campaign as conservatives seek delay in leadership elections
By Gabby Orr, Manu Raju, Dana Bash and Alex Rogers, CNN
Updated 7:47 PM EST, Fri November 11, 2022
Pool/Getty Images
CNN
 — 
Former President Donald Trump is calling up his allies in the Senate, GOP sources tell CNN, and making a suggestion as he seeks to divert blame for – Republicans’ lackluster midterm performance: Take aim at Mitch McConnell.
Trump, who is facing a round of sharp criticism from inside his own party for hurting Republican candidates in the midterms, has instead sought to gin up opposition to McConnell ahead of leadership elections next week – even as the GOP leader has already locked down enough support to win another two years, which would make him the longest-serving Senate party leader in US history.
Yet McConnell is facing new dissension within the ranks as a faction of Senate Republicans are grumbling internally about the timing of the leadership elections next week and are now calling for a delay – something that several GOP sources and a member of Republican leadership have signaled is unlikely to happen.
The internal back-biting has prompted a new round of fears: That Republicans will be at odds over their future and hurt their ability to unite ahead of the December 6 runoff for the US Senate seat in Georgia. Some of Trump’s allies fear that his obsession with the Kentucky Republican will only undercut their campaign in Georgia, with memories still raw for many in the party who blame the former President for costing them two seats and the Senate majority in last year’s runoff in the Peach State.
But privately, Trump is trying to turn GOP anger toward McConnell.
In phone calls with allies, elected officials and incoming members of Congress, the former President has accused McConnell of spending recklessly in states where Republicans faced significant headwinds at the expense of candidates in more competitive contests. He and aides have specifically alluded to the Alaska Senate race, where the McConnell-aligned Senate Leadership Fund spent more than $5 million attacking a Trump-backed Republican challenger to incumbent Sen. Lisa Murkowski. That candidate, Kelly Tshibaka, appears poised to advance to a ranked choice runoff against Murkowski on November 23.
Trump has been extremely critical of McConnell’s decision to slash support for Arizona Senate hopeful Blake Masters over the summer, one aide noted. Masters currently trails incumbent Sen. Mark Kelly by more than 100,000 votes with 80% of votes counted, according to the latest CNN data.
Sources said Trump has conveyed these frustrations to nearly everyone he has spoken to since Tuesday, hoping it will translate into an onslaught of public criticism of McConnell.
“He isn’t making explicit asks, but he wants to see more Republicans holding Mitch accountable,” said a second person close to Trump.
McConnell’s office declined to comment to CNN for this story.
But it was McConnell’s super PAC, that was the biggest spender in all Senate races in either party – dropping more than $280 million in ads along with its affiliated nonprofit group. Trump’s outside group spent a small fraction of that in Senate races.
In the Arizona race, McConnell told CNN last month that he and the major GOP donor, Peter Thiel, had a discussion over “resource allocation” as other outside groups went onto to prop up Masters. Plus, it was McConnell’s group that poured roughly $30 million into Ohio to bolster Trump’s-endorsed candidate, J.D. Vance, who was struggling against Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan but ultimately won convincingly.
Steven Law, the head of the Senate Leadership Fund, told CNN the group tried to put a concerted focus on Biden and Democrats this cycle. But he suggested that Trump’s emergence on the campaign trail helped Democrats late in the cycle.
“Keeping the focus on Joe Biden and Democrats who had voted for inflationary spending and who supported soft on crime policies, those are the priorities,” Law said. “And to the extent that there’s any distraction from that, it diminishes our ability to drive home that argument.”
Calls for leadership election delay
Senate Republicans next week are poised for a series of tense meetings. They are expected to meet behind closed doors next Tuesday for their first in-person meeting since the midterms.
Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, who is calling for a delay in the leadership elections, believes that Republicans first need to have a discussion about “why the results were what they were and what we are going to do about it,” a Rubio adviser said. The adviser said that Trump did not encourage Rubio to make the public plea for a delay.
“First we need to make sure that those who want to lead us are genuinely committed to fighting for the priorities & values of the working Americans (of every background) who gave us big wins in states like Florida,” Rubio tweeted.
Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican who opposes McConnell’s leadership bid, also tweeted that Republicans should delay the elections so as not to “disenfranchise” Herschel Walker, who is running in the Georgia runoff that will take place after the elections.
And three GOP senators – Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, Rick Scott of Florida and Mike Lee of Utah – sent a letter urging members of the GOP conference to postpone leadership elections scheduled for Wednesday, underscoring Senate Republicans’ frustration with the outcome of the 2022 elections.
“We are all disappointed that a Red Wave failed to materialize, and there are multiple reasons it did not,” says the letter. “We need to have serious discussions within our conference as to why and what we can do to improve our chances in 2024.”
Despite the push to delay, Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming said the leadership elections will go on as scheduled.
“We look forward to meeting next week with our new and returning members. I expect a full and open discussion beginning at Tuesday’s policy lunch on our path forward. On Wednesday we will meet again for our scheduled conference for elections,” said Barrasso, who oversees the leadership elections, in a message to the conference that was obtained by CNN.
“I welcome the questions and points made in the letter circulated by Senators Rick Scott, Lee and Johnson,” he wrote.
While the path to a Republican majority is narrow, Johnson and Lee won their reelection races in 2022. Scott serves in leadership now as the chair of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, the Senate GOP’s campaign arm.
Tennessee Sen. Marsha Blackburn is “supportive” of Johnson running for the No. 4 spot, Republican policy committee chair, according to her spokesperson.
“Someone suggested I run. I didn’t reject the idea and then rumors started to fly,” Johnson told CNN about a potential leadership bid. “My primary objective is to have robust and organized discussions within the conference prior to any leadership election and develop a more collaborative model for the conference.”
But McConnell allies say delaying an election where the GOP leader is not being challenged will only intensify the internal divisions.
“We need to move on,” one Senate GOP source said. “McConnell will win.”

A day of chaos brings Twitter closer to the brink

CNN Business
 — 
Two weeks after Elon Musk completed his acquisition of Twitter, the future of the company has never looked less certain.
In the past week alone, one of the world’s most influential social networks has laid off half its workforce; alienated powerful advertisers; blown up key aspects of its product, then repeatedly launched and un-launched other features aimed at compensating for it; and witnessed an exodus of senior executives.
The wild swings at Twitter only seemed to accelerate on Thursday with more executive departures, growing chaos over fake, verified accounts and an unusual public rebuke from the US government. Twitter now appears to be on the brink, a point Musk himself seemed to concede on Thursday by reportedly telling employees that bankruptcy could be on the horizon (though it’s far from the first time he’s warned about bankruptcy at one of his companies).
“Quite the day!” Musk tweeted.
It’s a stunning reversal of fortunes not just for Musk, who bought the company for $44 billion, but also for a platform used by some of the most powerful people on the planet, including world leaders, CEOs, and the Pope.
Twitter executives quit amid company turmoil
An end to the disruption seemed nowhere in sight on Friday. In its latest reversal on the matter, Twitter said it would re-introduce a gray “Official” badge for select accounts to help confirm their identities. The decision came after Twitter was forced to fend off a wave of verified-account impostors this week, including some posing as former President Donald Trump, Nintendo, and the pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly, among others. These accounts were the result of Musk’s decision to rush ahead with offering a blue check mark to any account holder willing to pay $8 a month, no questions asked, as he races to find new ways to make money from the platform.
That paid subscription service, too, was also suspended on Friday with little warning, just two days after its official launch, with the menu option to sign up for Twitter Blue suddenly disappearing from Twitter’s iOS app — the only place the add-on had been offered. It was not immediately clear when the company might restore the offering.
The gray “Official” badge has become an illustration of the whiplash users, employees, and advertisers have experienced in recent days.
Hours after the gray badges launched on Wednesday as a way to help users differentiate legitimate celebrity and branded accounts from accounts that had merely paid for a blue check mark, Musk abruptly tweeted that he had “killed” the feature, forcing subordinates to explain the reversal.
“We’re not currently putting an ‘Official’ label on accounts but we are aggressively going after impersonation and deception,” Twitter’s verified support account tweeted on Wednesday evening.
The account’s very next tweet, a day and nine hours later, said exactly the opposite: “To combat impersonation, we’ve added an ‘Official’ label to some accounts.”
Twitter did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the changes to the rollout of Twitter Blue or “Official” badges.
The paid verification feature’s rocky rollout attracted widespread criticism from misinformation experts who had warned it would make identifying trustworthy information much more difficult, particularly in the critical period following the US midterm elections. Even some of Musk’s fellow high-powered users of the platform had tough feedback.
“@elonmusk, from one entrepreneur to another, for when you have your customer service hat on. I just spent too much time muting all the newly purchased checkmark accts in an attempt to make my verified mentions useful again,” tweeted billionaire Mark Cuban.
“Bottom line is that you have a decision to make,” Cuban added. “Stick with the new Twitter that democratizes every tweet by paid accounts and puts the onus on all users to curate for themselves. Or bring back Twitter curation. One makes Twitter time and information efficient. The other is awful.”
In a Twitter Spaces event held for advertisers this week, Musk pleaded with brands to keep using the platform, after a growing number of companies paused ads, causing what Musk previously described as a “massive drop in revenue.” In the event, Musk sought to appear magnanimous in accepting responsibility for the company’s performance.
“If things go wrong, it’s my fault, because the buck stops with me,” he told an audience of over 100,000 listeners.
But privately, Musk’s critics have described the billionaire as dismissive of accountability, even in the face of scrutiny by the Federal Trade Commission, which publicly warned on Thursday, in a rare forward-looking statement, that it is “tracking recent developments at Twitter with deep concern.”
According to an internal Slack message posted by a Twitter employee and viewed by CNN, Musk has shown little fear of the FTC regulators overseeing the company’s multiple, legally binding consent agreements committing it to maintaining a robust cybersecurity program and producing written privacy impact reports before launching any new products or services, a requirement that could cover Twitter Blue.
Elon Musk pleads with advertisers to stay on Twitter
The company is already facing billions in potential fines from the FTC over alleged privacy missteps dating to before Musk’s ownership. But, the Twitter employee warned colleagues, Twitter could find itself even more legally exposed after the sudden resignation of multiple top Twitter executives charged with fulfilling the company’s FTC obligations, including its chief information security officer and chief privacy officer.
Forced to address the looming risk of FTC oversight, Musk reportedly struck a conciliatory tone.
“Twitter will do whatever it takes to adhere to both the letter and spirit of the FTC consent decree,” Musk reportedly wrote in an email to employees Thursday evening.
The one thing Musk claims is going in his favor at Twitter is user growth, as more people tune in to watch him fumble his way through owning the company.
“Twitter usage is at an all-time high,” Musk tweeted earlier this week, before adding in a follow-up tweet: “I just hope the servers don’t melt!”

 — 
Sam Bankman-Fried woke up on Monday still a billionaire, even as his cryptocurrency empire was beginning to unravel. By Friday, his fortune was completely wiped out.
Based on net worth calculations by Bloomberg, Bankman-Fried was worth about $16 billion at the start of the week. But as his crypto exchange, FTX, collapsed, the value of his assets was reduced to zero in what Bloomberg called “one of history’s greatest-ever destructions of wealth.”
Crypto is in chaos as FTX files for bankruptcy
FTX on Friday said it filed for bankruptcy, and Bankman-Fried, known as SBF, resigned as chief executive.
The 30-year-old entrepreneur’s net worth, which was largely tied up in digital assets, peaked at around $26 billion this spring. Over the summer, as crypto prices plummeted, Bankman-Fried emerged as a white knight for the sector, using his FTX exchange and its sister hedge fund, Alameda, to secure lines of credit to crypto companies like BlockFi and Voyager that were at risk of collapsing.
He told Reuters in July that he and FTX still had a “few billion” on hand to shore up other firms and help stabilize the industry.
Bankman-Fried owns about 70% of FTX’s US business, which the index now estimates to be essentially worthless. His stake in online brokerage Robinhood, previously valued at more than $500 million, was removed from Bloomberg’s calculation after news reports said that stake was held through Alameda and may have been used as collateral for loans.
As a follower of “effective altruism,” Bankman-Fried has sought to make as much money as possible in order to give it away. But the fate of his philanthropic endeavors is now in doubt.
On Thursday, the entire staff of the FTX Future Fund, which says it has committed $160 million in grants, publicly quit. In a statement, the five-person team wrote that they “have fundamental questions about the legitimacy and integrity of the business operations that were funding the FTX Foundation and the Future Fund.”

Democrats edge closer to control of US Senate with a key Arizona victory and a tightening race in Nevada

 — 
Democrats are just one seat away from keeping control of the US Senate as all eyes turn to Nevada, where the competitive Senate race is increasingly trending in Democrats’ direction.
CNN projected late Friday that Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona, who was elected in 2020 to fill the term of the late GOP Sen. John McCain, will win reelection, capping a string of victories for his party. Kelly’s defeat of venture capitalist Blake Masters, who had echoed former President Donald Trump’s lies about the 2020 election, marked yet another rejection by voters of a Trump-backed candidate who Democrats portrayed as an extremist.
What to know about the outstanding votes in Nevada and Arizona
So far, Democrats will hold 49 seats in the Senate and Republicans will hold 49 – meaning Democrats only need one more seat to clinch the majority in the Senate (with Vice President Kamala Harris casting the tie breaking vote). They could reach that critical 50-seat threshold if they are successful in Nevada, where Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto is closing in on Republican Adam Laxalt, the state’s former attorney general – who called the 2020 presidential election “rigged” and filed lawsuits on Trump’s behalf trying to overturn Biden’s 2020 victory in the Silver State.
The Nevada Senate race has been deadlocked for months, but it could ultimately determine the balance of power in the upper chamber. Democrats are also defending a seat in Georgia, where Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock and Republican Herschel Walker are headed to a December 6 runoff, CNN projects.
Control of the US House still hangs in the balance. But it is clear that even if Republicans win a majority, it will be by a far more slender margin than GOP leaders had hoped. That unexpected outcome has already produced recriminations and second-guessing of Republican leaders, including House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, who had hoped to be emerging from these contests with a clear mandate to become the next House majority leader.
The string of Democratic wins Friday night marked a stunning reversal of fortune for a party that had appeared to be in serious trouble heading into Tuesday’s elections. Candidates like Kelly and Cortez Masto were laboring under President Joe Biden’s low approval ratings, an unfavorable economic climate – with inflation and high gas prices pinching the budgets of families all across the country – and facing historical trends that tend to lead to steep losses in the first midterm cycle of a new president.
But this has been a complex cycle with many different crosscurrents affecting voter behavior, including the Supreme Court’s decision in June overturning abortion rights that angered many voters across the country. Republicans were also hamstrung by Trump’s decision to boost far-right candidates who were loyal to him, but often too extreme to appeal to the swing voters who decide elections. In the end, many independent voters and moderates appear to have rejected candidates they viewed as too extreme or too closely aligned with Trump – and Democrats turned out in droves to protect their incumbent candidates.
Masters’ defeat in Arizona came after prominent Democrats, including former President Barack Obama, swooped into the state in the final days of the election, warning that the very fate of the nation’s democracy was on the ballot. Voters in the Grand Canyon State also spurned the bid of GOP state Rep. Mark Finchem, a strident election denier backed by Trump, to become Arizona’s top elections official. Instead, they will elect Democrat Adrian Fontes as Arizona’s next secretary of state, CNN projected Friday night.
The one bright spot for Republicans was in Nevada, where voters elected Republican Joe Lombardo as the state’s next governor – tossing out Democrat Steve Sisolak, CNN projected. Lombardo, the popular Clark County sheriff, had reminded voters of their struggles during the Covid-19 pandemic, when unemployment in Nevada had peaked at nearly 30%. Though the economy has rebounded, Lombardo had argued that Sisolak’s policies had been too restrictive and had hampered the state’s economic recovery.
In an echo of 2020, some Republicans, including Masters, are already trying to stoke controversy about the counting of ballots in Maricopa County, Arizona – suggesting that that the count was unreliable there because of the handling of certain ballots. Both Masters and GOP gubernatorial nominee Kari Lake have suggested that the count has been moving too slowly.
On Friday, Masters made a similar argument to Lake, calling the counting process in Maricopa County – the largest county in Arizona and home to Phoenix – “incompetent,” pointing to a problem with printers that led to some ballots not being properly tabulated on Tuesday, even though election officials said that issue was remedied within hours on Election Day.
Masters also accused the county of mixing up uncounted ballots with ballots that had already been counted. The Republican National Committee and Republican Party of Arizona released a statement saying that the election “has exposed deep flaws in Maricopa County’s election administration. Arizona deserves better – transparency, certainty, efficiency – and most importantly, an accurate and prompt announcement of election results that can be accepted by all voters.”
A spokeswoman with the Maricopa County Elections Department told CNN’s Kyung Lah the county office has “redundancies in place that help us ensure each legal ballot is only counted once.”
“Because ballots are tabulated by batch, we are able to isolate the results from those specific locations and reconcile the total ballots against check-ins to ensure it matches. This is done with political party observers present and is a practice that has been in place for decades,” the spokesperson said.
Bill Gates, the chair of the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors, rejected Masters’ suggestion that the county should wipe the slate clean and start counting over again, stating that “is simply not allowed for under Arizona law.” Gates said the county’s pace for counting ballots is in line with previous years.
When asked on CNN about specific accusations from the Republican National Committee, Gates said he would prefer that they communicate those concerns to him directly. “I’m a Republican. Three of my colleagues on the board are Republicans. Raise these issues with us and discuss them with us, as opposed to making these baseless claims,” he said.
“Let the count continue on and at the end, if they have issues they choose to take to court, they have every right to do that, and we’ll let that process play through,” Gates added.
Kelly entered the 2022 cycle well positioned to withstand the headwinds facing Democrats – even in a purple state like Arizona that Joe Biden narrowly won – because of his formidable fundraising and unique personal brand as a retired astronaut, a Navy veteran and the husband of former Rep. Gabby Giffords.
Masters, a first-time candidate, was able to navigate the GOP primary gauntlet with significant financial backing from conservative tech billionaire Peter Thiel, his former boss. He appealed to Republicans by promising to prioritize immigration issues, and in a campaign video released last year, he said he believed Trump won the 2020 presidential election.
Masters then appeared to modulate his tone about the 2020 election results as well as the conservative stances he had sought out during the primary on abortion – in what initially seemed like an effort to appeal to broader swath of the Arizona electorate. (Though Republicans comprise a plurality in Arizona, independents make up about a third of the electorate and often sway close elections.)
After his primary victory in August, Masters scrubbed his website of language that included the false claim that the election was stolen. Under questioning from the moderator during a debate with Kelly, Masters conceded that he had not seen evidence of fraud in the 2020 vote counting or election results in a way that would have changed the outcome. In that debate and on the trail, Kelly had argued that the “wheels” could “come off our democracy” if election deniers like Masters were elected.
But Masters seemed to reverse course after receiving a phone call from Trump urging him to “go stronger” on election denialism, a conversation that was captured in a Fox documentary. In the final week of the campaign, Masters told CNN’s Lah he didn’t believe moderates were bothered by his comments about the 2020 election, insisting that voters were far more focused on their concerns about inflation, crime and the border.
Throughout the campaign, Kelly portrayed Masters as a candidate who was outside the mainstream, who would jeopardize abortion rights, as well as Social Security and Medicare. In a state where lawmakers passed a new ban on abortion at 15 weeks earlier this year – and where there are legal efforts underway to ban abortion in almost all cases – Kelly’s campaign kept a relentless focus on Masters’ anti-abortion stances.
Masters had said he would support a national ban on abortion after 15 weeks, a proposal that was advanced by South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham. That bill includes exceptions for rape, incest and to protect the life of the mother.

Magic wall: John King breaks down latest Nevada Senate numbers02:38
Nov. 11, 2022 US election coverage
By Adrienne Vogt, Matt Meyer, Elise Hammond, Tara Subramaniam and Seán Federico O'Murchú, CNN
Updated 10:07 a.m. ET, November 12, 2022
What we covered here
Win in Arizona: Democrats are one seat away from Senate control after CNN projects incumbent Mark Kelly will win the Arizona Senate race.
All eyes on Nevada: The Senate race in Nevada has tightened to around 800 votes, with about 56,000 ballots still to count, according to the latest tallies. GOP candidate, Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo, won the governor's race.
Runoff next month: Georgia's Senate contest is headed to a Dec. 6 runoff.
Where things stand in House races: Republicans appear to be slowly inching closer to the 218 seats that would deliver them a House majority, but several congressional races — including in California and Colorado — remain uncalled.

Maricopa County elections official pushes back on allegations of misconduct in vote counting
From CNN's Tara Subramaniam

The chairman of the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors Bill Gates pushed back on allegations of misconduct from Arizona Republican senatorial candidate Blake Masters, the Republican National Committee, and the Republican State Party of Arizona on Friday night.
""The suggestion by the Republican National Committee that there is something untoward going on here in Maricopa County is absolutely false and again, is offensive to these good elections workers,” he said.
On Friday night the RNC and the Republican Party of Arizona tweeted a statement criticizing the process in Maricopa County, and demanding that the county require ""around-the-clock shifts of ballot processing"" until all of the votes are counted.
Addressing the specific accusations from the RNC statement, Gates said “I would prefer that if there are concerns that they have, that they communicate those to us here. I'm a Republican. Three of my colleagues on the board are Republicans. Raise these issues with us and discuss them with us, as opposed to making these baseless claims.”
“Let the count continue on and at the end, if they have issues they choose to take to court, they have every right to do that, and we’ll let that process play through.” Gates added. 
Responding to claims that the count is “taking too long,” Gates said the county’s pace is in line with previous years. 
Tabulation concerns: Gates also responded to an assertion from Masters that the county had mixed up uncounted ballots with counted ballots and should ""wipe the slate clean"" and start counting all over again. 
In an interview Friday with Fox News's Tucker Carlson, Masters said that on ""at least two occasions,"" the county mixed up uncounted ballots placed in a secure drop box after they were not able to be processed on-site because of technical glitches, with ballots that had already been counted.
Gates said that there were two vote centers where ballots ""co-mingled"" -– but said that the county has a process to separate them out. 
And addressing the suggestion from Masters that the county should wipe the slate clean and start counting over again, Gates said that “is simply not allowed for under Arizona law.”
The voting tabulator glitches in Maricopa County on Election Day have become fodder for right-wing conspiracy theories. 
CNN projected Friday night that Arizona Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly would hold his seat.

Democratic Rep. Greg Stanton will defeat Republican Kelly Cooper to win Arizona's 4th Congressional District, CNN projects.
The win would be a hold for the Democratic Party.
CNN projects Democrats now have 203 of the 218 seats needed to control the House.
CNN projects Republicans have 211 seats.

Analysis: Democrats defied the odds but Biden still faces challenges
Democrats did better than the historical average in this midterm election, CNN's John King said Friday night.
But even so, if Democrats hold the Senate while Republicans control the House, it will be complicated for President Joe Biden to advance his agenda, King says.
CNN has not yet projected who will win control of the Senate or the House.
Watch below for CNN's John King's analysis:
10:36 p.m. ET, November 11, 2022
CNN Projection: Democrat Adrian Fontes will defeat election denier Mark Finchem in Arizona secretary of state race
From CNN staff

Democrat Adrian Fontes will win Arizona’s secretary of state race, CNN projects, and defeat Republican state Rep. Mark Finchem.
Finchem is one of Arizona’s most strident backers of former President Donald Trump’s lies about the 2020 election. Finchem, a self-proclaimed member of the far-right extremist group the Oath Keepers, has called the 2020 election “irredeemably compromised,” co-sponsored a bill that would’ve allowed the legislature to reject election results and attended Trump’s speech on Jan. 6 (but he’s denied he participated in the riot).
Fontes had called Finchem’s ideas “dangerous” and shortly after announcing his campaign called the state representative a “traitor clown.”
Arizona’s secretary of state serves as next in line to the governor, as the state doesn’t have a lieutenant governor.
The race had been one of the most closely watched contests for state election chief in the country, and national Democratic groups spent heavily to keep the open seat in their party’s column – as Finchem outraised Fontes. 
The current officeholder, Democrat Katie Hobbs, ran for Arizona governor this year. 
Fontes oversaw the 2020 election in Maricopa County, home to Phoenix. But he lost his reelection bid as county recorder that year after facing criticism for some of the changes he made to the county’s procedures during the pandemic.

Arizona Democrat gubernatorial candidate Katie Hobbs extends lead after latest Maricopa County results
From CNN's Tara Subramaniam

The latest results from Maricopa County are “not what the Republicans needed,” CNN’s John King said Friday night.
Shortly after the new batch was released, CNN projected that Democratic incumbent Mark Kelly will win against Republican Blake Masters.
“When the new votes come in, you have to meet your target because every time new votes come in, there’s a smaller pool left to count. So you need to meet or exceed your target if you’re the trailing candidate,” King said.
In Maricopa County, Arizona's most populated, Democrat Katie Hobbs now has 667,833 votes to Republican Kari Lake’s 607,359 votes.
Lake’s vote count is competitive, King said. “But if you’re trailing you need a bigger percentage than that.”
After the latest batch of Maricopa County votes, Hobbs has increased her lead state-wide, King noted.
But as more vote counts are released, it’s still mathematically possible for Lake to make up the difference, he said.
10:32 p.m. ET, November 11, 2022
CNN Projection: Incumbent Democrat Mark Kelly wins Arizona Senate race
From CNN's Maeve Reston
(Mark Kelly/Handout/Reuters)
Arizona Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly will win a full six-year term, CNN projects, defeating Republican Blake Masters, a venture capitalist who was backed by former President Donald Trump and had repeated some of his falsehoods about the 2020 election. 
The win by Kelly, who was elected in 2020 to fill the term of the late GOP Sen. John McCain, is a critical victory that edges Democrats one step closer to their goal of maintaining control of the US Senate – which would be a stunning feat given the low approval ratings of President Joe Biden and the unfavorable economic climate that seemed to be driving momentum toward the GOP. 
With Kelly’s win in Arizona, Democrats will hold 49 seats and Republicans will hold 49. With the Arizona seat in their column, Democrats would need to notch just one more seat to hold the majority in the upper chamber, following their pickup in Pennsylvania where Lt. Gov. John Fetterman, a Democrat, defeated Trump-backed Mehmet Oz in the contest to replace retiring Republican Sen. Pat Toomey. (The Senate is currently divided 50-50, but Vice President Kamala Harris casts the tie breaking vote). 
Both parties are still eyeing an incredibly close race in Nevada where Democrat Catherine Cortez Masto is trying to fend off a challenge from Republican Adam Laxalt, the state’s former attorney general. Democrats are also defending a seat in Georgia, where Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock and Republican Herschel Walker are headed to a December 6 runoff, CNN projects. 
Control of the US House still hangs in the balance, but it is clear that even if Republicans win a majority, it will be a far more slender advantage than GOP leaders had hoped. 
Kelly entered the 2022 cycle well positioned to withstand the headwinds facing Democrats -- even in a purple state like Arizona that Joe Biden narrowly won -- because of his formidable fundraising and unique personal brand as a retired astronaut, a Navy veteran and the husband of former Rep. Gabby Giffords. 
As the votes were counted in Arizona, Masters’ campaign team had hoped that an unusually large tranche of mail-in ballots that were dropped off at polling locations on Election Day would favor Republicans. Those ballots in Maricopa County, the state’s most populous, took longer to count than those cast in person on Tuesday because officials had to verify signatures on the ballot envelopes. 
In a call with reporters on Friday afternoon, Masters campaign advisers argued that Masters had a path to victory. “We always knew it was going to be a close race,” one campaign officials said. “Smart observers looking at this race know it is entirely too close to call. It’s probably going to come down to 10,000 votes either way. And we feel good, we have a path.” 
But ultimately as the tallies continued, Kelly opened a lead that Masters could not overcome. 
Earlier in the race, Masters, a first-time candidate, was able to navigate the GOP primary gauntlet with significant financial backing from conservative tech billionaire Peter Thiel, his former boss. He appealed to Republicans by promising to prioritize immigration issues, but also by echoing Trump’s lies about the 2020 election. In one campaign video released last year, he said he believed Trump won. 
Masters then appeared to modulate his tone about the 2020 election results as well as the conservative stances he had sought out during the primary on abortion – in what initially seemed like an effort to appeal to broader swath of the Arizona electorate. (Though Republicans comprise a plurality in Arizona, independents make up about a third of the electorate and often sway close elections). 
After his primary victory in August, Masters scrubbed his website of language that included the false claim that the election was stolen. Under questioning from the moderator during a debate with Kelly, Masters conceded that he had not seen evidence of fraud in the 2020 vote counting or election results in a way that would have changed the outcome. In that debate and on the trail, Kelly had argued that the “wheels” could “come off our democracy” if election deniers like Masters were elected. 
But Masters seemed to reverse course after receiving a phone call from Trump urging him to “go stronger” on election denialism, a conversation that was captured in a Fox documentary. In the final week of the campaign, Masters told CNN’s Kyung Lah he didn’t believe moderates were bothered by his comments about the 2020 election, insisting that voters were far more focused on their concerns about inflation, crime and the border. 
Throughout the campaign, Kelly portrayed Masters as an extremist, who would jeopardize abortion rights, as well as Social Security and Medicare. In a state where lawmakers passed a new ban on abortion at 15 weeks earlier this year – and where there are legal efforts underway to ban abortion in almost all cases – Kelly’s campaign kept a relentless focus on Masters’ anti-abortion stances. 
Masters had said he would support a national ban on abortion after 15 weeks, a proposal that was advanced by South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham. That bill includes exceptions for rape, incest and to protect the life of the mother.

CNN Projection: Republican Joe Lombardo will defeat Democratic Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak
From CNN's Maeve Reston

Republican Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo will defeat Democratic Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak, CNN projects.
Sisolak issued a statement conceding the race.
""While votes are still coming in – and we need every ballot tallied and every voice heard – it appears we will fall a percentage point or so short of winning,"" Sisolak said. ""Obviously that is not the outcome I want, but I believe in our election system, in democracy and honoring the will of Nevada voters.""
In his concession statement, Sisolak also voiced his support for fellow Democrat Catherine Cortez-Masto, who is locked in a tight race against Republican candidate Adam Laxalt.
Nevada has been a battleground state since the early 1990s, but Joe Biden narrowly clinched victory in the Silver State in 2020 despite a significant effort by Donald Trump, particularly in Nevada’s rural areas. Democrats have made gains in competitive races in recent years by relying, in part, on turning out working-class voters and Latinos, two key constituencies in a state that is heavily reliant on tourism as well as the hospitality and service industries. 
But those two voter blocs were among the hardest hit by the economic downturn during the pandemic, which sent unemployment in Nevada soaring to 30% in April of 2020 – the highest in the nation and more than twice the US unemployment rate at that time. The state’s workers then faced a double hit as inflation rose and gas prices topped $5 a gallon in a state where many people must drive long distances to work. 
That created an especially sour mood among voters as Sisolak embarked on his reelection campaign. Though the Democratic governor touted the recovery in the state’s labor market, Lombardo argued that Sisolak was painting a distorted picture of Nevadans’ economic struggles, because many Nevadans are still underemployed, he said. Lombardo also accused Sisolak of crushing businesses in the state with Covid-19 restrictions and onerous regulations. He said Sisolak was too slow to reopen schools and businesses, slowing the state’s recovery. But the Democratic governor pushed back by stating his primary focus was to “save lives.” 
Lombardo was one of the rare GOP candidates backed by both Trump and the Republican establishment. During the general election, he, at times, sought to keep his distance from Trump as he tried to win over moderate and independent voters. During a debate with Sisolak, Lombardo said he wouldn’t describe Trump as a “great” president and said he did not agree with Trump’s false assertions that the 2020 presidential election was rigged. 
But Sisolak suggested that Lombardo was giving different answers to different audiences. He also relentlessly attacked Lombardo’s shifts on abortion, which is protected in Nevada up to 24 weeks by a 1990 voter referendum. Lombardo argued that Nevada’s current law should stay in place, but Sisolak noted that he had changed his position several times during the course of the campaign. In May, for example, Lombardo told a columnist he would support sending voters a referendum moving the 24-week limit to 13 weeks. But he later said he had thought more about that potential change and no longer supported it. Still, Sisolak portrayed his Republican opponent as a threat to women’s reproductive rights. 
Sisolak did not invite Biden to campaign with him in the final stretch, but he also argued the president was being unfairly blamed for inflation, as well as problems that he inherited from Trump.

House Democrats quietly plot leadership plans while waiting for Nancy Pelosi’s next move
By Annie Grayer, Manu Raju and Daniella Diaz, CNN
Updated 4:35 PM EST, Fri November 11, 2022
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi joins a discussion on how the United States and allies can bolster climate action and change the trajectory of global warming on Friday at COP27 climate summit, in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt,
Emilie Madi/Reuters
CNN
 — 
The internal Democratic maneuvering to succeed House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is quietly playing out behind the scenes even as lawmakers are completely in the dark about her ambitions and future plans.
Members of Pelosi’s leadership team and those who have ambitions to succeed her have been reaching out to their colleagues and mounting a shadow campaign of sorts that will be ready to launch once Pelosi makes her decision and in time for the November 30 leadership elections.
“I’m getting tons of calls,” said one Democratic member, who like others, asked for anonymity to discuss the sensitive situation candidly. “The top three are mostly just checking in and saying, ‘Hi.’”
Others are preparing letters to announce their bids for the top three spots, planning meetings with new Democratic members next week and are preparing to mount a formal operation to lock down the votes once Pelosi’s future plans become clear, according to multiple Democratic sources.
Pelosi’s decision is not the only one that will set off a leadership scramble: Her top two deputies, Steny Hoyer of Maryland and Jim Clyburn of South Carolina, have not yet signaled their intentions. And if they decide to attempt to succeed her in the top spot, or try to keep a position in leadership, it could lead to a messy internal battle in the aftermath of surprising Democratic wins in Tuesday’s midterms. One member told CNN that Hoyer is exploring a range of options.
Like Pelosi, Hoyer and Clyburn are in their 80s, and are facing calls for generational change even as they command loyalty and respect from various wings of their caucus. If Pelosi were to step aside, the widespread belief internally is that Hakeem Jeffries, the 52-year-old Brooklyn Democrat and current caucus chairman, would be the front-runner. And he and two other Democrats from his generation and who have been at the leadership table – 59-year-old Katherine Clark of Massachusetts and 43-year-old Pete Aguilar of California – are seen as a team that would round out the top three leadership positions.
But those plans could be upset rather quickly since others have signaled interest in leadership spots. Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, has been quietly meeting with members for months as he sounds out a possible run for Democratic leader, while the head of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, Pramila Jayapal, is also seen as a potential candidate for a spot within the leadership team.
All of this rests, though, on what Pelosi decides to do. The expectation, sources say, is for Pelosi to announce her future once the House is called, and until then even her closest allies and aides do not know what she is going to do, even though she committed to Democrats years ago to step aside after 2022.
“Everyone I think is frozen by the situation,” a senior Democratic aide said.
One member said that the speaker is being so careful not to tip her hand that even Hoyer and Clyburn do not know what her plans are.
With tight margins, possibly a razor-thin GOP majority, sources say, it creates a dynamic that calls for a different set of leadership skills.
With Pelosi comes unparalleled institutional knowledge of operating under narrow margins and a staff that has years of experience leading the caucus – something the younger generation lacks. Pelosi has been hearing from some members who are asking her to stay on in the new Congress, even if Democrats are in the minority, two sources tell CNN, citing her ability to maintain discipline, something critical in a narrowly divided chamber.
“The speaker will make an announcement when she makes an announcement,” Drew Hammil, Pelosi’s spokesperson, told CNN in a statement. “Until then, let’s all enjoy watching Kevin McCarthy lose a speakership his party hasn’t even won in the first place.”
Pelosi told CNN’s Anderson Cooper this week that the violent attack on her husband, Paul Pelosi, has impacted her decision about her future – but she did not tip her hand about what direction she will go and even members closest to her do not know.
The decision, she said, “will be affected about what happened the last week or two.”

Pelosi’s deputies mum about their plans
Hoyer and Clyburn have privately and publicly signaled they wouldn’t necessarily step aside if Pelosi announces her move.
“They’ve made very clear that they are not going to abide by her timeline,” one member told CNN.
Hoyer told reporters earlier this week that he is waiting to make his decision until it is determined which party will remain in the majority.
“The impact of what ultimately happens will impact my decision,” Hoyer said.
Clyburn, according to two sources, would step down with an emeritus position should Jeffries become the leader. Clyburn’s office did not respond to CNN’s request for comment for the story.
But Clyburn told Politico that he would not stand in the way of Jeffries ascension.
“There’s nothing I would ever do to impede the progress of our up-and-coming young Democrats and I see him as an up-and-coming young Democrat,” Clyburn said. “He knows that, I didn’t have to tell him that — but I did.”
Whether the South Carolina Democrat would seek to stay in the leadership, though, is uncertain.

“It’s hard to fill in below the top spot until you know who the top spot is,” a senior aide said. “But that doesn’t mean conversations aren’t happening.”
As candidates for the top three are waiting to see what Pelosi does before publicly making moves, Democrats running to round out the bottom half of their party’s leadership have publicly announced and have begun full throttle campaigns.
Democratic Rep. Joe Neguse of Colorado, who currently serves as the co-chair of the Democratic Policy and Communications Committee, announced his run for Caucus Chair to replace Jeffries who is term limited.
The race to lead the party’s campaign arm, DCCC chair, is already heating up after the current chair Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney of New York lost his reelection, who Pelosi reportedly said “took an arrow for us.”
Democratic Rep. Tony Cardenas of California announced his race for the spot on Friday but others are being floated as well including Reps. Ami Bera and Sara Jacobs of California.

Georgia runoff highlights GOP worries about Trump – and excitement surrounding DeSantis

'They would make an awesome team': Who Republican voters would pick for president in 2024
02:41 - Source: CNN
CNN
 — 
Herschel Walker’s success in his upcoming runoff against incumbent Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock could depend on GOP luminaries flocking to Georgia between now and December 6, several Republicans say.
Many are torn over whether that should include former President Donald Trump, whose status as the anchor of the party is under renewed scrutiny amid an underwhelming midterm outcome for Republicans.
“Since Tuesday night, the No. 1 question I’ve been getting is, ‘Is Trump going to screw this up?’” said Erick Erickson, a prominent Georgia-based conservative radio host who backed Trump’s 2020 reelection bid.
The latest on the 2022 midterm elections
Though the former president helped recruit Walker, a Georgia football legend and longtime Trump family friend, into the Senate contest last year, he was ultimately advised to campaign elsewhere during the general election, two people familiar with the matter told CNN. Some Republicans are still haunted by Trump’s appearances in Georgia leading up to a pair of 2021 runoffs that ended with Democrats winning both seats and gaining control of the Senate. At the time, then-President Trump littered his campaign speeches with false claims that voter fraud was rampant in Georgia and that Republican officials had worked against him.
Walker allies feared that a Trump appearance ahead of the midterms would turn off independents and suburban women, critical voting blocs in the battleground state. Those concerns remain as Walker now enters the runoff period after neither he nor Warnock took more than 50% of the vote on Tuesday.
Some Georgia Republicans said Trump’s decision to proceed with an anticipated 2024 campaign launch next week will distract from what should be paramount for every Republican at the moment – helping the party secure a Senate majority. Trump aides sent out invitations late Thursday for a November 15 event at Mar-a-Lago, which the former president hopes will blunt the momentum behind Ron DeSantis, the popular Florida governor and potential presidential primary rival who glided to reelection this week.
In fact, while a debate unfolds over whether Trump should campaign for Walker in the coming days, several Republicans said they would eagerly welcome an appearance by DeSantis.
“We need every Republican surrogate we can get into the state to put their arm around Herschel. I think that [Virginia Gov. Glenn] Youngkin or DeSantis is a better fit for soft Republicans or independents in the suburbs that we need to turn out,” said Ralph Reed, president of the Faith & Freedom Coalition.
Reed later noted that he believes Trump could also be helpful in driving turnout among rural Georgia voters, though he cautioned that he was “not speaking for the [Walker] campaign.”
“I’ll let them work that out,” he said.
Walker campaign manager Scott Paradise did not return a request for comment.
‘DeSantis would be helpful’
A person close to the Walker campaign said DeSantis would be “a huge draw if we could get him,” noting that the Florida governor did not campaign for Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp despite being just over the border and recently stumping for candidates in New York, Arizona, Nevada and Pennsylvania. Kemp won his own reelection bid on Tuesday, defeating Democrat Stacey Abrams for the second time. And the Georgia governor has told allies he wants to help Walker any way he can, including by hitting the campaign trail for him, according to a person briefed on those conversations.
“DeSantis would be helpful. Youngkin would be helpful. Kemp will be helpful. I think those are the biggest draws in Georgia,” said Erickson.
A Republican with knowledge of DeSantis’ political operation said DeSantis’ interest in campaigning for Walker “depends on what happens with the remaining two races” for Senate in Arizona and Nevada. Both contests remain too close to call but if Republicans win one of the races, control of the upper chamber will come down to Georgia.
“It becomes the center of the political universe at that point,” this person said.
A spokesman for DeSantis did not respond to a request for comment about his future travel plans. Though DeSantis endorsed Republicans in tough battlegrounds and campaigned for controversial candidates like Arizona’s Kari Lake and Pennsylvania’s Doug Mastriano, he made no such effort during the midterms to aid Walker amid a flurry of headlines about the former Heisman Trophy winner’s tumultuous past and personal troubles.
DeSantis – whose Tallahassee executive residence is 20 miles from the Florida-Georgia border – also did not join the GOP fight in the Peach State two years ago for a pair of Senate runoffs Republicans ultimately lost.
But a Republican fundraiser close to DeSantis said the Florida governor would likely make the trip across the border if he believes he can help Walker. “He’s a Republican leader and wants Republicans to take the Senate,” the fundraiser said.
Momentum -- and planning -- for DeSantis 2024 bid takes off after resounding Florida win
But if DeSantis shows up in Georgia, Trump allies said it would be exponentially harder to convince the former president to stay out of the state himself. Much to the frustration of those who want a distraction-free environment for Walker, Trump has continued to hurl insults at DeSantis in recent days, snapping at the Florida governor in a statement Thursday that referred to him as “an average Republican governor” who lacked “loyalty and class” for refusing to rule out a White House bid of his own.
If the Florida Republican goes to campaign for Walker, those attacks would likely intensify, said a person close to Trump.
“Imagine [Trump] seeing Ron campaign for Herschel while he is being told, ‘Please stay away.’ He would go ballistic,” this person said.
One Trump aide, who requested anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, said one idea being floated is to have the former president help Walker financially with a generous check. Trump’s MAGA Inc. super PAC gave $16.4 million to candidates in the closing weeks of the 2022 cycle and he was sitting on more than $100 million across his fundraising committees at the end of September, according to federal election data.
“He is looking at how he can salvage this moment and one of the ways for him to do that is to help Walker win,” said a Trump adviser, referring to Tuesday’s underwhelming outcome for Republicans and the stinging defeat of Mehmet Oz in Pennsylvania, whom Trump had endorsed in the Republican Senate primary.
“But I think there’s no way he can announce a campaign for president and not go campaign for Walker,” the person added, claiming that Trump’s absence from Georgia as the presumptive frontrunner for the 2024 GOP presidential nomination would suggest he is a liability for vulnerable Republicans – a toxic message to be sending at the outset of a presidential campaign.
Michael Caputo, a 2016 Trump campaign aide who remains close to the former president, said Trump should do as much as possible to raise money for Walker because a presidential announcement will likely cause a surge in Democratic contributions to Warnock.
“You have to offset that on the Walker side. From my perspective, the best thing Trump can do is donate and raise a ton of money for Herschel because he can,” Caputo said.
Trump’s political team has held discussions about how he can best help Walker since it became clear the Georgia Senate race would advance to a runoff, according to two sources familiar, both of whom said nothing has been firmly decided.
“President Trump is 220-16 in races that have been called, and with the support of President Trump, Herschel Walker, after forcing a run-off, is well-positioned to win,” Trump spokesman Taylor Budowich said in a statement to CNN.
Worries about a 2021 repeat
Much of the sensitivity around a Trump visit to Georgia stems from his campaign appearances for former GOP Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler two years ago, when both Republicans were fighting for survival in their own runoff contests.
On the eve of those runoffs in 2021, Trump tore into statewide Republican officials for refusing to challenge the 2020 election results in Georgia, falsely claiming that he had won the state and promising to return when Kemp was up for reelection to campaign against the GOP incumbent, which Trump later fulfilled by recruiting Perdue to challenge Kemp in a primary.
How Georgia's looming runoff election evokes America's segregationist history
Republicans back in Washington watched the rally in horror at the time, deeply concerned that Trump’s intense focus on election fraud and various attacks on statewide Republican officials would depress voter turnout among his core supporters the following day. In the end, both Loeffler and Perdue lost their runoffs, catapulting Warnock and Jon Ossof into the Senate and handing Democrats a narrow majority.
The episode has come back to haunt Trump as Republicans face a potentially identical scenario to 2021, with control of the Senate riding on Georgia if Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly wins reelection in Arizona and Republican Adam Laxalt unseats incumbent Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto in Nevada. Laxalt currently has a razor-thin lead while Kelly is more than 100,000 votes ahead of his Republican challenger, according to the vote counts as of Friday morning. Less concerned that he would deliver a message that depresses turnout, Republicans are primarily worried this time around that Trump would ultimately be a drag on Walker in a once deep-red state that is now trending purple and where the polarizing former president might alienate the exact voters Walker needs to prevail.
“Herschel needs to do better among Kemp voters and independents in the suburbs,” said Reed. “About 5% of the voters that went to Kemp didn’t go to Herschel and he needs to get a minimum of 1 out of every 4 of them.”

CNN Projection: Incumbent Democrat Mark Kelly wins Arizona Senate race
From CNN's Maeve Reston
(Mark Kelly/Handout/Reuters)
Arizona Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly will win a full six-year term, CNN projects, defeating Republican Blake Masters, a venture capitalist who was backed by former President Donald Trump and had repeated some of his falsehoods about the 2020 election. 
The win by Kelly, who was elected in 2020 to fill the term of the late GOP Sen. John McCain, is a critical victory that edges Democrats one step closer to their goal of maintaining control of the US Senate – which would be a stunning feat given the low approval ratings of President Joe Biden and the unfavorable economic climate that seemed to be driving momentum toward the GOP. 
With Kelly’s win in Arizona, Democrats will hold 49 seats and Republicans will hold 49. With the Arizona seat in their column, Democrats would need to notch just one more seat to hold the majority in the upper chamber, following their pickup in Pennsylvania where Lt. Gov. John Fetterman, a Democrat, defeated Trump-backed Mehmet Oz in the contest to replace retiring Republican Sen. Pat Toomey. (The Senate is currently divided 50-50, but Vice President Kamala Harris casts the tie breaking vote). 
Both parties are still eyeing an incredibly close race in Nevada where Democrat Catherine Cortez Masto is trying to fend off a challenge from Republican Adam Laxalt, the state’s former attorney general. Democrats are also defending a seat in Georgia, where Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock and Republican Herschel Walker are headed to a December 6 runoff, CNN projects. 
Control of the US House still hangs in the balance, but it is clear that even if Republicans win a majority, it will be a far more slender advantage than GOP leaders had hoped. 
Kelly entered the 2022 cycle well positioned to withstand the headwinds facing Democrats -- even in a purple state like Arizona that Joe Biden narrowly won -- because of his formidable fundraising and unique personal brand as a retired astronaut, a Navy veteran and the husband of former Rep. Gabby Giffords. 
As the votes were counted in Arizona, Masters’ campaign team had hoped that an unusually large tranche of mail-in ballots that were dropped off at polling locations on Election Day would favor Republicans. Those ballots in Maricopa County, the state’s most populous, took longer to count than those cast in person on Tuesday because officials had to verify signatures on the ballot envelopes. 
In a call with reporters on Friday afternoon, Masters campaign advisers argued that Masters had a path to victory. “We always knew it was going to be a close race,” one campaign officials said. “Smart observers looking at this race know it is entirely too close to call. It’s probably going to come down to 10,000 votes either way. And we feel good, we have a path.” 
But ultimately as the tallies continued, Kelly opened a lead that Masters could not overcome. 
Earlier in the race, Masters, a first-time candidate, was able to navigate the GOP primary gauntlet with significant financial backing from conservative tech billionaire Peter Thiel, his former boss. He appealed to Republicans by promising to prioritize immigration issues, but also by echoing Trump’s lies about the 2020 election. In one campaign video released last year, he said he believed Trump won. 
Masters then appeared to modulate his tone about the 2020 election results as well as the conservative stances he had sought out during the primary on abortion – in what initially seemed like an effort to appeal to broader swath of the Arizona electorate. (Though Republicans comprise a plurality in Arizona, independents make up about a third of the electorate and often sway close elections). 
After his primary victory in August, Masters scrubbed his website of language that included the false claim that the election was stolen. Under questioning from the moderator during a debate with Kelly, Masters conceded that he had not seen evidence of fraud in the 2020 vote counting or election results in a way that would have changed the outcome. In that debate and on the trail, Kelly had argued that the “wheels” could “come off our democracy” if election deniers like Masters were elected. 
But Masters seemed to reverse course after receiving a phone call from Trump urging him to “go stronger” on election denialism, a conversation that was captured in a Fox documentary. In the final week of the campaign, Masters told CNN’s Kyung Lah he didn’t believe moderates were bothered by his comments about the 2020 election, insisting that voters were far more focused on their concerns about inflation, crime and the border. 
Throughout the campaign, Kelly portrayed Masters as an extremist, who would jeopardize abortion rights, as well as Social Security and Medicare. In a state where lawmakers passed a new ban on abortion at 15 weeks earlier this year – and where there are legal efforts underway to ban abortion in almost all cases – Kelly’s campaign kept a relentless focus on Masters’ anti-abortion stances. 
Masters had said he would support a national ban on abortion after 15 weeks, a proposal that was advanced by South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham. That bill includes exceptions for rape, incest and to protect the life of the mother. 
CNN analysts break down the latest numbers:

CNN Projection: Republican Joe Lombardo will defeat Democratic Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak
From CNN's Maeve Reston

Republican Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo will defeat Democratic Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak, CNN projects.
Sisolak issued a statement conceding the race.
""While votes are still coming in – and we need every ballot tallied and every voice heard – it appears we will fall a percentage point or so short of winning,"" Sisolak said. ""Obviously that is not the outcome I want, but I believe in our election system, in democracy and honoring the will of Nevada voters.""
In his concession statement, Sisolak also voiced his support for fellow Democrat Catherine Cortez-Masto, who is locked in a tight race against Republican candidate Adam Laxalt.
Nevada has been a battleground state since the early 1990s, but Joe Biden narrowly clinched victory in the Silver State in 2020 despite a significant effort by Donald Trump, particularly in Nevada’s rural areas. Democrats have made gains in competitive races in recent years by relying, in part, on turning out working-class voters and Latinos, two key constituencies in a state that is heavily reliant on tourism as well as the hospitality and service industries. 
But those two voter blocs were among the hardest hit by the economic downturn during the pandemic, which sent unemployment in Nevada soaring to 30% in April of 2020 – the highest in the nation and more than twice the US unemployment rate at that time. The state’s workers then faced a double hit as inflation rose and gas prices topped $5 a gallon in a state where many people must drive long distances to work. 
That created an especially sour mood among voters as Sisolak embarked on his reelection campaign. Though the Democratic governor touted the recovery in the state’s labor market, Lombardo argued that Sisolak was painting a distorted picture of Nevadans’ economic struggles, because many Nevadans are still underemployed, he said. Lombardo also accused Sisolak of crushing businesses in the state with Covid-19 restrictions and onerous regulations. He said Sisolak was too slow to reopen schools and businesses, slowing the state’s recovery. But the Democratic governor pushed back by stating his primary focus was to “save lives.” 
Lombardo was one of the rare GOP candidates backed by both Trump and the Republican establishment. During the general election, he, at times, sought to keep his distance from Trump as he tried to win over moderate and independent voters. During a debate with Sisolak, Lombardo said he wouldn’t describe Trump as a “great” president and said he did not agree with Trump’s false assertions that the 2020 presidential election was rigged. 
But Sisolak suggested that Lombardo was giving different answers to different audiences. He also relentlessly attacked Lombardo’s shifts on abortion, which is protected in Nevada up to 24 weeks by a 1990 voter referendum. Lombardo argued that Nevada’s current law should stay in place, but Sisolak noted that he had changed his position several times during the course of the campaign. In May, for example, Lombardo told a columnist he would support sending voters a referendum moving the 24-week limit to 13 weeks. But he later said he had thought more about that potential change and no longer supported it. Still, Sisolak portrayed his Republican opponent as a threat to women’s reproductive rights. 
Sisolak did not invite Biden to campaign with him in the final stretch, but he also argued the president was being unfairly blamed for inflation, as well as problems that he inherited from Trump.

Blake Masters' campaign says tonight's ballot release will be key for the trailing Republican candidate
From CNN's From Kyung Lah

The campaign of Blake Masters, the Republican Senate candidate in Arizona, says there is a possible path to victory within the batch of ballots that will be released at 10 p.m. ET by Maricopa County.
The campaign, trailing Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly, believes if there is to be a tide shift, it will be in the mail-in ballots dropped off on Election Day.
“We have a path,” the campaign said in a background call with reporters ahead of tonight’s election results. 
The Kelly campaign, for its part, told CNN it feels increasingly confident with each passing election result from Maricopa County, believing Masters' path is becoming more challenging.
Some background: Maricopa County, Arizona's largest and home to Phoenix, is expecting to release approximately 80,000 votes around 10 p.m. ET, chairman of the Maricopa County Board Supervisors, Bill Gates, told reporters earlier on Friday. 
More than half of the votes released tonight will be absentee ballots that voters dropped off at polling places on Election Day – and this is the first report to include ballots from this large batch. 
The total will also include a decent portion of Election Day ballots that were not able to be read by tabulator machines due to technical issues that day, and the remainder of early votes the county received before Election Day. 
The majority of the ballots the county releases moving forward will be absentee ballots dropped off on Election Day. 
After tonight’s release, there will be less than 300,000 total ballots left to tabulate in the county.
CNN's Annie Grayer contributed to this report.

Nevada Senate race tightens to around 800 votes after new tallies from state's largest county
Catherine Cortez Masto and Adam Laxalt. (Getty Images)
In the hotly contested Senate race in Nevada, Republican candidate Adam Laxalt's lead over incumbent Democrat Catherine Cortez Masto has shrunk to about 800 votes – after new tallies were released from Clark County, the largest in the state that includes Las Vegas.
Of those newly reported ballots, about 66% of them were for Cortez Masto, according to analysis from CNN’s John King. He added that most of the ballots yet to be counted are in Clark County.
""This is where the largest number of outstanding votes are still,” King said of the Nevada county. “She needs to do this. This is what she needs to do to catch up,” he said referring to how Cortez Masto is winning the majority of the votes in Clark County.
CNN is yet to project which party will win the House and the Senate as several key races are too early to call — including this one in Nevada. Right now, Democrats have won 48 states and Republicans hold 49.
There are still about 68,000 votes left to be tabulated in Nevada, according to CNN’s David Chalian.
Of these remaining votes, Cortez Masto needs between 50-51% of them to win, while Laxalt needs to get between 49-50% to hold onto his slight lead, Chalian predicted.

Senate GOP leadership elections expected to go on as scheduled despite push for a delay
From CNN's Manu Raju
Despite the push by some conservatives to delay next week’s Senate GOP leadership elections, they are going on as scheduled.
Sen. John Barrasso, who oversees the leadership vote, shared the news in a message to the conference that was obtained by CNN.
""I welcome the questions and points made in the letter circulated by Senators Rick Scott, Lee and Johnson,"" Barrasso wrote, referencing a message from the three senators that called for ""serious discussions"" about the party's lackluster midterms showing before a vote.
""I too support a robust Conference discussion about our agenda, federal budgeting and spending, floor procedures, and the other important priorities outlined prior to elections and the beginning of the 118th Congress,"" Barrasso wrote.
""To help accomplish that, I propose we continue that effort immediately,"" he continued.
The conference will hold a policy lunch Tuesday and then on Wednesday meet for the scheduled elections, the senator said. Barrasso argued both meetings would provide ample opportunity for debate.

Democratic Rep. Susie Lee will win her bid for a third term in Nevada’s 3rd Congressional District, fending off a fierce challenge from Republican April Becker, CNN projects, in a race that drew millions of dollars from the super PACs tied to the House leadership.
This win would be a hold for the Democratic Party.
CNN now projects Democrats have 200 seats of the 218 seats needed to control the House.
CNN projects Republicans have 211 seats.

CNN Projection: Democrat Tina Kotek ekes out a victory in challenging race for Oregon governor

Democrat Tina Kotek will win an unexpectedly difficult race for governor in Oregon, CNN projects, where the independent candidacy of former state Sen. Betsy Johnson had created a rare pathway for a competitive race in a deep-blue state.
Kotek will be one of the first out lesbian governors in the nation along with Democrat Maura Healey, who clinched the Massachusetts governorship Tuesday.
Her Republican opponent Christine Drazan conceded the race, saying she'd spoken with Kotek and ""hope for the best for our state as she steps into this role.""
""Though the campaign for Governor of Oregon has come to an end, I am immensely grateful for all the Oregonians who joined our movement to take our state in a new direction,"" Drazan said in the statement.
Johnson, a former state senator who cast herself as the candidate who would govern from the center, received more than 8% of the vote, according to the most recent tally.

Several Metro Atlanta school districts will transition to remote learning for the Dec. 6 Senate run-off between Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock and Republican Herschel Walker. 
“A majority of Fulton County schools serve as polling sites, and this decision will keep students and staff safer. Since the run-off election is expected to draw high voter turnout, there will be a large number of outside visitors to our campuses. The additional traffic can also create campus congestion with packed parking lots, which can affect buses and car rider lanes,"" Fulton County Schools said in a statement.
Additionally, Atlanta Public Schools said that 29 facilities are active polling stations with three additional locations serving as ballot drop-off sites.
“December 6 will be a virtual, asynchronous learning day for all schools and all departments, to support quality teaching and learning while balancing the safety and security of scholars and staff,” APS said in their statement.
Cobb County Schools will also have a virtual learning day on Dec. 6, the district announced saying many of their buildings will be directly impacted by the run-off election.

Some past and current Republican members of Congress blame Trump for party’s losses, say time to move on in 2024
By Andrew Kaczynski, CNN

 — 
Former and current Republican members of Congress refused to commit to the possibility of a Donald Trump bid for the presidency in interviews on conservative talk radio following the midterm elections.
With the results still being counted in some states, numerous members and former members speaking candidly took aim at the former president for the party’s subpar results – with some openly pointing to Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis as a better candidate for the party.

More on the midterms
“There’s just a lot of negative attitudes about Trump,” Rep. Troy Nehls said on Houston Morning News. The Texas conservative once called Trump one of America’s greatest presidents after winning his endorsement in spring 2022.
On the Dom Giordano program, a conservative talk radio station in Pennsylvania, former Sen. Rick Santorum compared Trump to Moses in the Bible – but said it was time to move on.
“He changed, he transformed the Republican party, but that doesn’t necessarily mean he’s the right guy to actually lead the party going forward into an era of governance and prosperity,” Santorum said.
“Just be happy you’re Moses, and it’s time to turn the page,” Santorum, who endorsed Trump in 2016, added.
On North Carolina talk radio on Thursday, former Rep. Mark Walker of North Carolina, the former vice chair of the Republican Conference blasted Trump for backing Mehmet Oz and others, adding that Trump had picked the “wrong horse” in many races. Trump backed Walker’s opponent in the Republican primary for North Carolina’s Senate seat, Ted Budd – who went on to win the race this week.
“You’re looking long term and taking a look, Ron DeSantis may be the guy,” said Walker, citing DeSantis’ lopsided win in Florida.
On the Steve Gruber Show, Republican Rep. Tim Walberg of Michigan said the former president might need to change his message, when he was asked about Trump-endorsed candidates losing around the country,
“I don’t like that either,” Walberg, who Trump endorsed this cycle, said. “That that turned out that way, and it was somewhat unexpected. So I hope that President Trump, as he moves forward, really does a postmortem and thinks what this means to his message.”
Analyzing the results of the 2022 midterms, other Republican members of Congress declined to commit their support to Trump or another candidate.
“I think they got to get together and make a decision on who’s going to run,” Rep. Andy Harris of Maryland said on WCBM on Thursday.
Republican Sen. Kevin Cramer of North Dakota, speaking on local radio on Friday on WZFG said he supported a wide open primary in 2024.
“Donald Trump’s statements about Ron DeSantis, I think demonstrated a significant flaw, frankly, in his ability to unify the party and unify the country,” Cramer said. “And so, as much as I’d love four years of Donald Trump, followed by eight years of Ron DeSantis, it’s those first four years that I would worry about us being able to achieve. We need to put our absolute best foot forward.”
“I’d say everybody ought to get into the race that’s interested in being in the race,” he added. “Put ‘em all on that stage again, everybody duke it out on the debate stage.”
On Bloomdaddy radio on Thursday, Rep. Guy Reschenthaler of Pennsylvania said Trump might consider being “kingmaker” in a 2024 Republican primary – but said the race was still Trump’s to lose.
“I know we’ve had conversations about this offline, but at this point that decision is between DeSantis and Trump,” he said. “And whether or not Trump is seeing that DeSantis’ star’s on the rise and he might be better being a kingmaker instead of risking running and losing the primary,” he said.
On WABC radio, Republican Rep. Nicole Malliotakis said Republicans would need to rally around a candidate, whether it be DeSantis or Trump.
“We all need to be together in this and united rally around a candidate whether it’s gonna be President Trump, whether it’s gonna be Governor DeSantis,” she said.

Novak Djokovic leaves no stone unturned in pursuit of greatness, but secrecy with drink mixture draws scrutiny
By Matias Grez, CNN
Updated 11:42 AM EST, Thu November 10, 2022

 — 
In his pursuit of greatness, it has been well documented that Novak Djokovic has left no stone unturned.
From changing his diet to incorporating meditation into his training, the Serb is constantly trying to find that extra edge to improve his chances on the tennis court.
His latest efforts, however, have drawn criticism.
In a video posted on social media, Djokovic’s physio Ulises Badio is seen preparing a drink in the stands during Saturday’s semifinal win over Stefanos Tsitsipas at the Paris Masters.
Wimbledon in discussions about changing its all-white uniform policy after Billie Jean King reveals it is her 'pet peeve'
Badio is then shielded by two other men as he finishes preparing the drink, before handing it to a ball girl to pass onto Djokovic.
The incident has been described as looking “amazingly dodgy” and “bizarre” by two journalists on Twitter.
However, Djokovic’s wife Jelena has launched a vigorous defense of the 21-time grand slam champion on social media.
“I don’t see anything dodgy,” Jelena Djokovic wrote in one reply. “In fact, I see people trying to be private about their business in a world where everyone feels like they have every right to point a camera at you whenever they want.
“Apparently, wanting/trying to be private makes you dodgy nowadays.”
“Sit a bit in silence’
In one Twitter interaction, a user suggested Djokovic hire a PR agency to help avoid these types of backlash, an idea which was given short shrift from the tennis star’s wife.
“He will talk when he is ready to talk,” Jelena replied. “This whole nonsense about making people speak about something they are not ready because OTHERS are unpatient (sic) is absurd.
“Sit a bit in silence. Mind yourself more. Not everything you see is controversial. It could be private. Is that allowed?”
Djokovic was eventually defeated by unseeded Danish teenager Holger Rune 3-6 6-3 7-5 in the final of the Paris Masters.
Teenager Holger Rune shocks Novak Djokovic to claim Paris Masters title
It’s not the first time Djokovic has drawn curiosity over a drinks bottle.
During his victorious Wimbledon run earlier this year, Djokovic was seen inhaling from a drinks bottle. When questioned about it in the post-match press conference, the world No. 8 laughed it off and said it was a “magic potion.”
“It’s going to come out as one of the supplement, let’s say, lines that I’m doing right now with drink and a few other things,” he said.
“You’ll try it and you’ll let me know how it feels. You might win Wimbledon.”
Australian Open participation
With January’s Australian Open fast approaching, it remains unclear whether Djokovic, who is unvaccinated against Covid-19, will be able to compete.
He is currently banned from re-entering the country until 2025 after being deported before the start of the tournament earlier this year.
Last month, Tennis Australia boss Craig Tiley said he would not try to convince the Australian government to allow Djokovic to compete in the tournament.

“At this point, Novak and the federal government need to work out the situation and then we’ll follow any instruction after that,” Tiley told reporters.
“It’s not a matter we can lobby on. It’s a matter that definitely stays between the two of them and then depending on the outcome of that we would welcome him to the Australian Open.
“(Djokovic) said that he’d obviously love to come back to Australia, but he knows it’s going to be an ultimate decision for the federal government.
“He’s accepted that position. It’s a private matter between them but we’d like to welcome Novak back – he’s a nine-time champion – provided he gets the right entry requirements into Australia.”

 — 
Rainn Wilson has “changed” his name and is inviting others to do the same.
“The Office” actor debuted “Rainnfall Heat Wave Rising Sea Levels Wilson” on social media Thursday as a way to raise awareness about the climate control crisis.

“As a cheap little stunt to help save planet Earth, I’ve changed my name on Twitter, Instagram and even on my fancy writing paper,” he said in a video he shared on his verified social media accounts.
In the Twitter thread that included the video, Wilson added that he was unable to change his name on Twitter “… because Elon,” referencing guidelines implemented on the platform by new owner Elon Musk.
Wilson encouraged his followers to visit environmental advocacy group Arctic Basecamp’s “Arctic Name Changer” to get their own names to be used on their social media profiles in the hopes of capturing the attention of the world leaders assembling in Egypt for the COP27 international climate change conference.

Magic wall: John King breaks down latest Nevada Senate numbers02:38
Nov. 11, 2022 US election coverage
By Adrienne Vogt, Matt Meyer, Elise Hammond, Tara Subramaniam and Seán Federico O'Murchú, CNN
Updated 10:07 a.m. ET, November 12, 2022
What we covered here
Win in Arizona: Democrats are one seat away from Senate control after CNN projects incumbent Mark Kelly will win the Arizona Senate race.
All eyes on Nevada: The Senate race in Nevada has tightened to around 800 votes, with about 56,000 ballots still to count, according to the latest tallies. GOP candidate, Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo, won the governor's race.
Runoff next month: Georgia's Senate contest is headed to a Dec. 6 runoff.
Where things stand in House races: Republicans appear to be slowly inching closer to the 218 seats that would deliver them a House majority, but several congressional races — including in California and Colorado — remain uncalled.

CNN Projection: Republican Joe Lombardo will defeat Democratic Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak
From CNN's Maeve Reston

Republican Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo will defeat Democratic Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak, CNN projects.
Sisolak issued a statement conceding the race.
""While votes are still coming in – and we need every ballot tallied and every voice heard – it appears we will fall a percentage point or so short of winning,"" Sisolak said. ""Obviously that is not the outcome I want, but I believe in our election system, in democracy and honoring the will of Nevada voters.""
In his concession statement, Sisolak also voiced his support for fellow Democrat Catherine Cortez-Masto, who is locked in a tight race against Republican candidate Adam Laxalt.
Nevada has been a battleground state since the early 1990s, but Joe Biden narrowly clinched victory in the Silver State in 2020 despite a significant effort by Donald Trump, particularly in Nevada’s rural areas. Democrats have made gains in competitive races in recent years by relying, in part, on turning out working-class voters and Latinos, two key constituencies in a state that is heavily reliant on tourism as well as the hospitality and service industries. 
But those two voter blocs were among the hardest hit by the economic downturn during the pandemic, which sent unemployment in Nevada soaring to 30% in April of 2020 – the highest in the nation and more than twice the US unemployment rate at that time. The state’s workers then faced a double hit as inflation rose and gas prices topped $5 a gallon in a state where many people must drive long distances to work. 
That created an especially sour mood among voters as Sisolak embarked on his reelection campaign. Though the Democratic governor touted the recovery in the state’s labor market, Lombardo argued that Sisolak was painting a distorted picture of Nevadans’ economic struggles, because many Nevadans are still underemployed, he said. Lombardo also accused Sisolak of crushing businesses in the state with Covid-19 restrictions and onerous regulations. He said Sisolak was too slow to reopen schools and businesses, slowing the state’s recovery. But the Democratic governor pushed back by stating his primary focus was to “save lives.” 
Lombardo was one of the rare GOP candidates backed by both Trump and the Republican establishment. During the general election, he, at times, sought to keep his distance from Trump as he tried to win over moderate and independent voters. During a debate with Sisolak, Lombardo said he wouldn’t describe Trump as a “great” president and said he did not agree with Trump’s false assertions that the 2020 presidential election was rigged. 
But Sisolak suggested that Lombardo was giving different answers to different audiences. He also relentlessly attacked Lombardo’s shifts on abortion, which is protected in Nevada up to 24 weeks by a 1990 voter referendum. Lombardo argued that Nevada’s current law should stay in place, but Sisolak noted that he had changed his position several times during the course of the campaign. In May, for example, Lombardo told a columnist he would support sending voters a referendum moving the 24-week limit to 13 weeks. But he later said he had thought more about that potential change and no longer supported it. Still, Sisolak portrayed his Republican opponent as a threat to women’s reproductive rights. 
Sisolak did not invite Biden to campaign with him in the final stretch, but he also argued the president was being unfairly blamed for inflation, as well as problems that he inherited from Trump.

Blake Masters' campaign says tonight's ballot release will be key for the trailing Republican candidate
From CNN's From Kyung Lah

The campaign of Blake Masters, the Republican Senate candidate in Arizona, says there is a possible path to victory within the batch of ballots that will be released at 10 p.m. ET by Maricopa County.
The campaign, trailing Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly, believes if there is to be a tide shift, it will be in the mail-in ballots dropped off on Election Day.
“We have a path,” the campaign said in a background call with reporters ahead of tonight’s election results. 
The Kelly campaign, for its part, told CNN it feels increasingly confident with each passing election result from Maricopa County, believing Masters' path is becoming more challenging.
Some background: Maricopa County, Arizona's largest and home to Phoenix, is expecting to release approximately 80,000 votes around 10 p.m. ET, chairman of the Maricopa County Board Supervisors, Bill Gates, told reporters earlier on Friday. 
More than half of the votes released tonight will be absentee ballots that voters dropped off at polling places on Election Day – and this is the first report to include ballots from this large batch. 
The total will also include a decent portion of Election Day ballots that were not able to be read by tabulator machines due to technical issues that day, and the remainder of early votes the county received before Election Day. 
The majority of the ballots the county releases moving forward will be absentee ballots dropped off on Election Day. 
After tonight’s release, there will be less than 300,000 total ballots left to tabulate in the county.
CNN's Annie Grayer contributed to this report.

Nevada Senate race tightens to around 800 votes after new tallies from state's largest county
Catherine Cortez Masto and Adam Laxalt. (Getty Images)
In the hotly contested Senate race in Nevada, Republican candidate Adam Laxalt's lead over incumbent Democrat Catherine Cortez Masto has shrunk to about 800 votes – after new tallies were released from Clark County, the largest in the state that includes Las Vegas.
Of those newly reported ballots, about 66% of them were for Cortez Masto, according to analysis from CNN’s John King. He added that most of the ballots yet to be counted are in Clark County.
""This is where the largest number of outstanding votes are still,” King said of the Nevada county. “She needs to do this. This is what she needs to do to catch up,” he said referring to how Cortez Masto is winning the majority of the votes in Clark County.
CNN is yet to project which party will win the House and the Senate as several key races are too early to call — including this one in Nevada. Right now, Democrats have won 48 states and Republicans hold 49.
There are still about 68,000 votes left to be tabulated in Nevada, according to CNN’s David Chalian.
Of these remaining votes, Cortez Masto needs between 50-51% of them to win, while Laxalt needs to get between 49-50% to hold onto his slight lead, Chalian predicted.

Senate GOP leadership elections expected to go on as scheduled despite push for a delay
From CNN's Manu Raju
Despite the push by some conservatives to delay next week’s Senate GOP leadership elections, they are going on as scheduled.
Sen. John Barrasso, who oversees the leadership vote, shared the news in a message to the conference that was obtained by CNN.
""I welcome the questions and points made in the letter circulated by Senators Rick Scott, Lee and Johnson,"" Barrasso wrote, referencing a message from the three senators that called for ""serious discussions"" about the party's lackluster midterms showing before a vote.
""I too support a robust Conference discussion about our agenda, federal budgeting and spending, floor procedures, and the other important priorities outlined prior to elections and the beginning of the 118th Congress,"" Barrasso wrote.
""To help accomplish that, I propose we continue that effort immediately,"" he continued.
The conference will hold a policy lunch Tuesday and then on Wednesday meet for the scheduled elections, the senator said. Barrasso argued both meetings would provide ample opportunity for debate.

Democratic Rep. Susie Lee will win her bid for a third term in Nevada’s 3rd Congressional District, fending off a fierce challenge from Republican April Becker, CNN projects, in a race that drew millions of dollars from the super PACs tied to the House leadership.
This win would be a hold for the Democratic Party.
CNN now projects Democrats have 200 seats of the 218 seats needed to control the House.
CNN projects Republicans have 211 seats.

Democrat Tina Kotek will win an unexpectedly difficult race for governor in Oregon, CNN projects, where the independent candidacy of former state Sen. Betsy Johnson had created a rare pathway for a competitive race in a deep-blue state.
Kotek will be one of the first out lesbian governors in the nation along with Democrat Maura Healey, who clinched the Massachusetts governorship Tuesday.
Her Republican opponent Christine Drazan conceded the race, saying she'd spoken with Kotek and ""hope for the best for our state as she steps into this role.""
""Though the campaign for Governor of Oregon has come to an end, I am immensely grateful for all the Oregonians who joined our movement to take our state in a new direction,"" Drazan said in the statement.
Johnson, a former state senator who cast herself as the candidate who would govern from the center, received more than 8% of the vote, according to the most recent tally.

Several Metro Atlanta school districts will transition to remote learning for the Dec. 6 Senate run-off between Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock and Republican Herschel Walker. 
“A majority of Fulton County schools serve as polling sites, and this decision will keep students and staff safer. Since the run-off election is expected to draw high voter turnout, there will be a large number of outside visitors to our campuses. The additional traffic can also create campus congestion with packed parking lots, which can affect buses and car rider lanes,"" Fulton County Schools said in a statement.
Additionally, Atlanta Public Schools said that 29 facilities are active polling stations with three additional locations serving as ballot drop-off sites.
“December 6 will be a virtual, asynchronous learning day for all schools and all departments, to support quality teaching and learning while balancing the safety and security of scholars and staff,” APS said in their statement.
Cobb County Schools will also have a virtual learning day on Dec. 6, the district announced saying many of their buildings will be directly impacted by the run-off election.

Various groups push voters to ""cure"" flawed mail ballots with Nevada races still uncalled 
From CNN’s Dan Merica
Political organizations, especially Democratic-leaning unions, but also Republican organizations, that spent months urging people to vote in Nevada’s key Senate race are now turning their focus toward “curing” flawed mail-in ballots in the still-uncalled contest.
“Curing” is a process where voters correct problems with their mail ballot, ensuring that it gets counted. This can mean validating that a ballot is truly from them, by adding a missing signature, or by addressing signature-match issues. The deadline for voters to “cure” their ballots in Nevada is Nov. 14, according to state law. 
With the razor-thin margin in the contest between Democratic incumbent Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto and Republican challenger Adam Laxalt, the relatively small universe of ballots that need to be “cured” could make a difference. Laxalt currently leads Cortez Masto by about 9,000 votes, according to the latest tally.
The Clark County Registrar announced earlier on Friday that 9,659 ballots were eligible to be cured in the pivotal county, which includes Las Vegas. Officials from Washoe County, which is home to Reno, said they have 1,440 ballots that need to be cured.
The Culinary Union Local 226, which represent roughly 60,000 workers in populous Clark and Washoe County and is central in Democratic efforts in the state, tells CNN they have the “largest cure team in the state,"" with union spokesperson Bethany Khan saying the group has ""200 canvassers doing phone bank, door knocking, and employee dining room cures."" 
Other Democratic groups are also engaged in the curing effort. Somos Votantes, a political organization founded in 2019 that targeted boosting Latino turnout in Nevada, is reaching out to voters in both Spanish and English and offering to provide transportation to voters who need it.
Republicans are also engaged in the effort. Republican National Committee spokeswoman Hallie Balch said in a statement that the group had “a duty to inform voters that their ballot needs curing in order to be counted.” 
According to Clark County’s Election website, curing happens “if a question arises about your signature on the outside of your mail ballot return envelope or if you did not put your signature on the outside of that envelope, the Election Department will notify you using the contact information in your voter registration.”

Trump mounts anti-McConnell campaign as conservatives seek to delay leadership vote
From CNN's Gabby Orr, Manu Raju and Dana Bash

Former President Donald Trump is calling up his allies in the Senate, GOP sources tell CNN, and making a suggestion on the heels of a lackluster midterms performance: Take aim at Mitch McConnell.
Trump, who is facing a round of sharp criticism from inside his own party for hurting Republican candidates in the midterms, has instead sought to gin up opposition to McConnell before leadership elections next week.
The GOP leader has already locked down enough support to win another two years, which would make him the longest-serving Senate party leader in US history. But he is facing new dissension within the ranks as a faction of Senate Republicans are grumbling internally about the timing of the leadership elections next week and are now calling for a delay — something that several GOP sources signal is unlikely to happen.
Privately, Trump is trying to turn GOP anger toward McConnell. 
In phone calls with allies, elected officials and incoming members of Congress, the former president has accused McConnell of spending recklessly in states where Republicans faced significant headwinds at the expense of candidates in more competitive contests.
He and aides have specifically alluded to the Alaska Senate race, where the McConnell-aligned Senate Leadership Fund spent more than $5 million attacking a Trump-backed Republican challenger to incumbent Sen. Lisa Murkowski. That candidate, Kelly Tshibaka, appears poised to advance to a ranked-choice runoff against Murkowski on Nov. 23.
Trump has been extremely critical of McConnell's decision to slash support for Arizona Senate hopeful Blake Masters over the summer, one aide noted. Masters currently trails incumbent Sen. Mark Kelly by more than 100,000 votes with 80% of votes counted, according to the latest CNN data. 
Sources said Trump has conveyed these frustrations to nearly everyone he has spoken to since Tuesday, hoping it will translate into an onslaught of public criticism of McConnell. 
""He isn't making explicit asks but he wants to see more Republicans holding Mitch accountable,"" said a second person close to Trump.

New York
CNN Business
 — 
Larry David made a prediction about this week’s crypto meltdown that was prettaaay prettaaay good.
In a Super Bowl ad for the FTX crypto exchange in February, Larry David sarcastically predicted that FTX wasn’t going to make it. The ad shows David’s character throughout history, naysaying humanity’s greatest inventions, including the wheel, the lightbulb, coffee and democracy.
At the end of the ad, David learns about FTX, “a safe and easy way to get into crypto.” A dismissive David says, “Ehhh, I don’t think so. And I’m never wrong about this stuff — never.”
“Don’t be like Larry,” the FTX ad closes.
The ad resurfaced on social media this week after FTX imploded. David’s character was, it turns out, right to be skeptical.
FTX filed for bankruptcy proceedings in the United States on Friday, marking a stunning downfall for one of the biggest and most powerful players in the crypto industry. CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, the 30-year-old founder of the exchange, resigned.
Rival Binance had said it would explore an FTX bailout earlier this week but almost immediately backtracked after the company said FTX was essentially beyond saving.
The full extent of FTX’s financial problems aren’t yet known, but multiple reports say the firm is facing an $8 billion shortfall. Without a quick infusion of equity, Bankman-Fried reportedly told investors Thursday, the firm was facing bankruptcy.
Despite its reputation as a dependable, low-risk investment portal, FTX’s business appears to have been built on a complex, extremely risky kind of leveraged trading.
Customers deposited their money to engage in crypto trading. But it appears that FTX instead took billions of dollars worth of that money and loaned it out to its sister firm, Alameda, to fund those high-risk bets, according to The Wall Street Journal.
CEO Sam Bankman-Fried resigned Friday. He had been one of the faces of the crypto industry, amassing a fortune once totaling $25 billion that has since vanished. He was viewed as the crypto world’s white knight, stepping in to rescue struggling companies earlier this year. FTX, backed by elite investors like BlackRock and Sequoia Capital, rapidly became one of the biggest crypto exchanges in the world.
Regulators are now swirling to investigate what went wrong, and some lawmakers are demanding a crackdown.

Trump sues January 6 committee seeking to block subpoena for his testimony and documents
By Katelyn Polantz, Sara Murray and Gabby Orr, CNN
Updated 10:36 PM EST, Fri November 11, 2022

 — 
Former President Donald Trump has sued the House select committee investigating January 6, 2021, as a way to challenge its subpoena for documents and his testimony, according to filings in a federal court in Florida.
Trump is challenging both the legitimacy of the committee – which multiple courts have upheld – and is claiming he should be immune from testimony about the time he was president.
Trump’s lawyers say they’ve communicated with the House over the past week and a half as the subpoena deadlines neared, offering to consider answering written questions while expressing “concerns and objections” about the bulk of the document requests.
“The Subpoena’s request for testimony and documents from President Trump is an unwarranted intrusion upon the institution of the Presidency because there are other sources of the requested information, including the thousand-plus witnesses the Committee has contacted and one million documents that the Committee has collected,” his attorneys argue in the suit. “The Committee also may obtain abundant government records relevant to its inquiry. Because of this obvious availability to obtain testimony and documents from other readily available sources, the Subpoena is invalid.”
A spokesperson for the January 6 committee declined to comment.
Trump said the House’s demands, if he met them, would violate privilege protections around the executive branch, including revealing conversations he had with Justice Department officials and members of Congress about the 2020 election and “pending governmental business.”
He also argued to the court that he shouldn’t have to reveal inner workings about his 2020 presidential campaign, “including his political beliefs, strategy, and fundraising. President Trump did not check his constitutional rights at the Oval Office door. Because the Committee’s Subpoena to President Trump infringes upon his First Amendment rights it is invalid.”
Trump’s attorney, David Warrington, said in a statement in part that “long-held precedent and practice maintain that separation of powers prohibits Congress from compelling a President to testify before it.”
The lawsuit veers the Trump subpoena fight toward a likely dead-end for the House select committee.
Trump’s back-and-forth with the House followed by the lawsuit will make it much harder for the committee to enforce the subpoena – and the dispute essentially will be unresolvable before the current Congress expires in January.
The lawsuit also raises some protections around the presidency that have never fully been tested by appeals courts, and Trump brought the lawsuit in a court that, unlike DC, hasn’t weighed in on his standoffs with House Democrats over the past several years.
Trump provided to the court his team’s recent letters with the committee, which show that the House panel tried to zero in last week on obtaining records of his electronic communication on personal phones, via text or on other apps from January 6, 2021. The House also said it sought to identify every telephone and other communication device Trump used from Election Day until he left the presidency, according to the letters.
In one letter on November 4, the original date of the document-turnover deadline, the House committee accused Trump’s team of trying to delay.
“Given the timing and nature of your letter – without any acknowledgment that Mr. Trump will ultimately comply with the subpoena – your approach on his behalf appears to be a delay tactic,” wrote Rep. Bennie Thompson, the Mississippi Democrat who chairs the committee.
Since Trump’s team replied on November 9 that he wouldn’t testify and found no records to turn over related to personal communications, the House hasn’t respond substantively, the court papers said.
But Trump’s legal team responded to the House this week that Trump “voluntarily directed a reasonable search for documents in his possession” that could fit those two categories. The search found nothing, his lawyers said.

British Airways will let male staff wear makeup and piercings
Toyin Owoseje, CNN • Published 11th November 2022
Facebook
Twitter
Email
(CNN) — British Airways is the latest airline to relax its rigid uniform rules in a bid to champion the individuality of its employees.
Following a recent update in the airline's uniform guidelines, pilots and cabin crew are now allowed to sport facial stubble, wear make-up, jewelry, and nail varnish of their choice -- regardless of their gender.
The carrier said it wanted workers to be the ""most authentic version of themselves"" in a bid to foster an ""inclusive"" environment.

Virgin Atlantic launches new gender-neutral uniform policy
""We are proud of all of our colleagues at British Airways and we are committed to an inclusive working environment,"" a British Airways spokesperson said in a statement to CNN on Friday.
""We have worked with our people to create updated guidelines for grooming, beauty and accessories, allowing our colleagues to bring the best, most authentic version of themselves to work every day.""
According to the UK's Guardian newspaper, BA's latest memo urges staff to ""be bold, be proud, be yourself.""
The move comes after rival airline Virgin Atlantic scrapped its gendered uniform policy as part of a wider series of initiatives under its ""Be Yourself"" agenda.

Back in September, Virgin Atlantic said male cabin and crew could wear skirts and their female colleagues could wear trousers because it wanted staff to feel comfortable -- ""no matter their gender, gender identity, or gender expression.""
Other recent reforms by the airline include allowing staff to display their tattoos while in uniform and make-up becoming non-compulsory for female staff.

Inside the superstar affair for the funeral of Migos rapper Takeoff

CNN
 — 
State Farm Arena was transformed into a church Friday as family and fans gathered to celebrate the earthly departure of Takeoff from Migos.
The three-hour sendoff was a superstar affair, featuring performances from Justin Bieber, Chloe Bailey and Yolanda Adams, as well as a poem by Drake, and words of remembrance from Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens and the founders of Migos’ label, Quality Control Music.
Cousin Offset, who along with Takeoff’s uncle, Quavo, formed the platinum hit factory known as Migos, struggled to compose himself remembering his bandmate, who he grew up with and considered a brother. His head down, dreadlocks obscuring his face, he repeatedly apologized.
Offset repeatedly breaks down Friday during Takeoff's memorial service at Atlanta's State Farm Arena.
Kevin Mazur/Getty Images
“I love you, dog. I love you,” he said.
Offset hasn’t been able to sleep or eat following the November 1 killing, he told the several thousand people in attendance, most of them dressed in black. Every time he dozes off, he said, he wakes up hoping news of his 28-year-old cousin’s fatal shooting in Houston was a terrible dream.
“I wish we could laugh again,” he said. “I wish I could smoke one with you.”
He closed saying how Migos changed the future of music – “You did that, Take” – and called for more brotherhood and fellowship in the world before asking the crowd to pray with him.
Drake delivers poem
The ceremony opened with about an hour of gospel music. White roses covered the stage, and Takeoff’s casket sat at the foot of stairs made to resemble mother of pearl. Acrobats in angel outfits danced in the back corners, suspended from white ribbons, as a choir sang. An infinity symbol with Takeoff’s signature rocket emblem at its center ringed the arena, a nod not only to his latest productions but also to how he’ll be remembered – forever.
Bieber took the stage in a dark toboggan, as box candles on the stadium screens bathed the arena floor in a soft glow. Perched on a stool with only a piano backing him, the two-time Grammy winner performed “Ghost.”
“And if you can’t be next to me/Your memory is ecstasy/I miss you more than life,” he crooned.
Drake, who in 2013 catapulted the rising stars into an altogether other universe when he remixed and added a verse to their hit, “Versace,” leaned on British entertainer Joyce Grenfell and writer Maya Angelou in his eulogy.
After quoting Maya Angelou, Drake delivers his own poem during Takeoff's Celebration of Life.
Kevin Mazur/Getty Images
He quoted from Grenfell: “If I should go before the rest of you/Break not a flower nor inscribe a stone/Nor when I’m gone speak in a Sunday voice/But be the usual selves that I have known.”
He then paraphrased Angelou’s “When Great Trees Fall,” a poem on how it’s understandable to be sad when great trees are felled, or when great souls pass, but it’s wise to remember, “They existed. They existed/We can be. Be and be better/For they existed.”
The hip-hop superstar, who just released an album with Atlanta’s 21 Savage, then recited his own poem, “We Should Do That More,” remembering how he got to know Migos on their 54-city tour in 2018. He teared up recalling the Swiss wristwatch, an Audemars Piguet, that Takeoff gave him as a gift
“I miss performing with my brothers,” he said. “We should do that more.”
The quiet Migo
Takeoff will always be remembered as the quiet Migo, but several speakers cautioned the crowd not to mistake his silence for a lack of things to say. He is regarded by many as the best rhymesmith of the trio, and Jesse Curney III, pastor of the Lilburn church Takeoff’s family attends, shared a story that Quavo once told him about Takeoff’s sobriquet.
Where Quavo and Offset needed multiple takes to get their verses onto tracks, retaking and retaking until they got it right, Takeoff – the youngest of the three – would walk up to the mic and lay down his lyrics in one perfect take. “He was an introvert,” the pastor said, “but he trusted God” to not hold back.
Takeoff's flower-covered casket sits at the foot of the stage during the service.

Between Bailey’s stirring rendition of Beyonce’s “Heaven” and Adams’ performance of the gospel song, “The Battle is Not Yours,” Takeoff’s family members took the podium to offer fond memories of the humble, wise, peaceful young man who always wanted to be a rapper but never fretted over credit or the spotlight. Even as a baby, he had a unique voice, his mother, Titania Davenport-Treet, said.
“I could tell his cry from any other child,” she said, adding that God must have given him that voice because he always knew what he wanted to be.
He was quiet but always paid attention, family members said, and he never bothered anyone. He was the funniest guy in the room, and no matter how famous he got, he never stopped putting family first and making sure their needs were met, they said.
“He hugged so tight, you could feel the love transferring through him,” his mother said.
Fans lined up hours before event
State Farm was a fitting venue for Takeoff’s farewell. The rapper was often courtside – usually with Quavo and Offset – for Atlanta Hawks games, iced out and dripping. For years, his music has bellowed through the PA system during timeouts and replay reviews.
Though doors did not open until an hour before the noon event, fans began lining up outside the arena at around 8:30 a.m., despite a cool, steady drizzle. Around 10, a woman held her arm out of a passing silver Mazda and barked, “Rest in peace, Takeoff.” The fans in line waved back.
Kalandrick Woods, 24, and girlfriend Kailey Allen, 20, of Covington, were second in line. Woods took the day off as a sandblast machine operator, and they drove about 45 minutes to get downtown.
Woods became melancholy when asked his favorite song – “Last Memory” off Takeoff’s 2018 debut solo effort – and said it’s still hard to talk about his favorite Migo. He cried when he heard the news, he said.
“I’m still depressed about it,” he said.
Woods likes that Takeoff was known to keep to himself, but by no means did that mean he was the lesser third of the group. With every new song, he appeared more developed as a lyricist, able to switch from rapid fire rap to deliberate four- or five-word bursts that painted vivid scenes. He put on mind-blowing displays of lyricism on 2014’s “Cross the Country” and more recently on his and Quavo’s “Integration,” staying on beat like a metronome as he flipped styles on the tracks.
“Deadshot (brrt)/AK make that head rock (brrt)” is the beginning of Fifi Solomon’s favorite Takeoff verse, though she had to think on it for a few seconds. From Migos’ 2017 hit, “Slippery,” Takeoff goes last – following Quavo, Offset and fellow ATLien Gucci Mane – and brings his band’s Quentin Tarantinoesque cartel personae into graphic focus.
“He said a lot in just a few words,” Solomon said. “He was the quietest, but I think he was the deepest lyrically.”
Solomon, 25, and her friend, Nani Kidane, 28, traveled from Migos’ onetime home base of Gwinnett County for the funeral. The band’s impact reached well beyond Atlanta, they said. They were trendsetters in fashion and influenced the way rappers inject ad-libs into their music.
They also set an example with their work ethic, Kidane said. Takeoff will be dearly missed, she said.
“I’m a big fan,” Solomon said. “He was my favorite lyrically out of the group, and he’s from where I’m from so it hit harder.”
Added Kidane, “It hit close to home being from Gwinnett.”
Impact anything but quiet
Maliyah Tindall, 22, of Riverdale, and Sequoia Thomas, 20, of Atlanta, also cited Takeoff’s “Slippery” verse as one of their favorites. The pair drove from Clayton State University in Morrow, about 30 minutes away, to pay their respects.
“He’s huge for the culture,” Thomas said before the funeral. “They paved the way for a lot of rappers who are going to be here today.”
“He was quiet but had a big impact,” Tindall said, spurring Thomas to add, “Like a tame lion.”
Migos were a fixture of Tindall’s and Thomas’ adolescence, they said, and he didn’t always get the recognition he deserved, but he showed up on every track.
“He’d even take over people’s songs outside Migos,” Thomas said of his features with other artists, including Lil Wayne, Roddy Rich and Travis Scott.
Takeoff seemed aware of his notoriety as the subdued Migo, but the Lawrenceville-born rap star also seemed ready to shake the reputation, eerily telling the podcast, “Drink Champs,” last month, “It’s time to pop it, you know what I mean? It’s time to give me my flowers, you know what I mean? I don’t want them later on when I ain’t here. I want them right now, so …”
Quavo recalls how he and his nephew, Takeoff, wanted to be pro wrestlers as kids.

After more than a dozen Migos mixtapes and four studio albums – two of them platinum – Takeoff and Quavo recently announced they’d be performing as Unc & Phew. Last month, the pair released, “Only Built for Infinity Links,” with Offset noticeably missing. Though the band had not officially broken up, there were rumors of some sort of beef among the trio.
It was abundantly clear from Friday’s remembrance that Offset would give a lot to speak with his cousin one more time. Migos fans are hopeful that Takeoff’s tragic killing might help Quavo and Offset reconsider whatever drove them to move in different directions.
“I hope they can set aside their differences,” Solomon told CNN. “You know, come together for Takeoff.”

 — 
Two weeks after Elon Musk completed his acquisition of Twitter, the future of the company has never looked less certain.
In the past week alone, one of the world’s most influential social networks has laid off half its workforce; alienated powerful advertisers; blown up key aspects of its product, then repeatedly launched and un-launched other features aimed at compensating for it; and witnessed an exodus of senior executives.
The wild swings at Twitter only seemed to accelerate on Thursday with more executive departures, growing chaos over fake, verified accounts and an unusual public rebuke from the US government. Twitter now appears to be on the brink, a point Musk himself seemed to concede on Thursday by reportedly telling employees that bankruptcy could be on the horizon (though it’s far from the first time he’s warned about bankruptcy at one of his companies).
“Quite the day!” Musk tweeted.
It’s a stunning reversal of fortunes not just for Musk, who bought the company for $44 billion, but also for a platform used by some of the most powerful people on the planet, including world leaders, CEOs, and the Pope.
Twitter executives quit amid company turmoil
An end to the disruption seemed nowhere in sight on Friday. In its latest reversal on the matter, Twitter said it would re-introduce a gray “Official” badge for select accounts to help confirm their identities. The decision came after Twitter was forced to fend off a wave of verified-account impostors this week, including some posing as former President Donald Trump, Nintendo, and the pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly, among others. These accounts were the result of Musk’s decision to rush ahead with offering a blue check mark to any account holder willing to pay $8 a month, no questions asked, as he races to find new ways to make money from the platform.
That paid subscription service, too, was also suspended on Friday with little warning, just two days after its official launch, with the menu option to sign up for Twitter Blue suddenly disappearing from Twitter’s iOS app — the only place the add-on had been offered. It was not immediately clear when the company might restore the offering.
The gray “Official” badge has become an illustration of the whiplash users, employees, and advertisers have experienced in recent days.
Hours after the gray badges launched on Wednesday as a way to help users differentiate legitimate celebrity and branded accounts from accounts that had merely paid for a blue check mark, Musk abruptly tweeted that he had “killed” the feature, forcing subordinates to explain the reversal.
“We’re not currently putting an ‘Official’ label on accounts but we are aggressively going after impersonation and deception,” Twitter’s verified support account tweeted on Wednesday evening.
The account’s very next tweet, a day and nine hours later, said exactly the opposite: “To combat impersonation, we’ve added an ‘Official’ label to some accounts.”
Twitter did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the changes to the rollout of Twitter Blue or “Official” badges.
The paid verification feature’s rocky rollout attracted widespread criticism from misinformation experts who had warned it would make identifying trustworthy information much more difficult, particularly in the critical period following the US midterm elections. Even some of Musk’s fellow high-powered users of the platform had tough feedback.
“@elonmusk, from one entrepreneur to another, for when you have your customer service hat on. I just spent too much time muting all the newly purchased checkmark accts in an attempt to make my verified mentions useful again,” tweeted billionaire Mark Cuban.
“Bottom line is that you have a decision to make,” Cuban added. “Stick with the new Twitter that democratizes every tweet by paid accounts and puts the onus on all users to curate for themselves. Or bring back Twitter curation. One makes Twitter time and information efficient. The other is awful.”
In a Twitter Spaces event held for advertisers this week, Musk pleaded with brands to keep using the platform, after a growing number of companies paused ads, causing what Musk previously described as a “massive drop in revenue.” In the event, Musk sought to appear magnanimous in accepting responsibility for the company’s performance.
“If things go wrong, it’s my fault, because the buck stops with me,” he told an audience of over 100,000 listeners.
But privately, Musk’s critics have described the billionaire as dismissive of accountability, even in the face of scrutiny by the Federal Trade Commission, which publicly warned on Thursday, in a rare forward-looking statement, that it is “tracking recent developments at Twitter with deep concern.”
According to an internal Slack message posted by a Twitter employee and viewed by CNN, Musk has shown little fear of the FTC regulators overseeing the company’s multiple, legally binding consent agreements committing it to maintaining a robust cybersecurity program and producing written privacy impact reports before launching any new products or services, a requirement that could cover Twitter Blue.
Elon Musk pleads with advertisers to stay on Twitter
The company is already facing billions in potential fines from the FTC over alleged privacy missteps dating to before Musk’s ownership. But, the Twitter employee warned colleagues, Twitter could find itself even more legally exposed after the sudden resignation of multiple top Twitter executives charged with fulfilling the company’s FTC obligations, including its chief information security officer and chief privacy officer.
Forced to address the looming risk of FTC oversight, Musk reportedly struck a conciliatory tone.
“Twitter will do whatever it takes to adhere to both the letter and spirit of the FTC consent decree,” Musk reportedly wrote in an email to employees Thursday evening.
The one thing Musk claims is going in his favor at Twitter is user growth, as more people tune in to watch him fumble his way through owning the company.
“Twitter usage is at an all-time high,” Musk tweeted earlier this week, before adding in a follow-up tweet: “I just hope the servers don’t melt!”

Gun hidden in a raw chicken found at Florida TSA checkpoint

(CNN) — A gun found inside a raw chicken at an airport security checkpoint has the TSA calling ""personal fowl.""
""The plot chickens,"" the Transportation Security Administration posted this week on Instagram after someone at the agency put on their punny pants and called attention to the ""baste of time"" that is stuffing a bird with a firearm.
The passenger was headed to Port-au-Prince, Haiti, according to Sari Koshetz, a TSA spokesperson for the Gulf region.
Nestor Iglesias, a spokesperson for Homeland Security Investigations, the investigative arm of the US Department of Homeland Security, said he could not offer additional details because it is an ""ongoing criminal case which has been accepted for prosecution.""
A record number of guns have arrived at TSA checkpoints in Florida in 2022. Passengers have brought more than 700 guns to checkpoints at airports in the state so far this year -- a year-to-date number that already surpasses any previous year, according to a TSA news release.
Records have been set at 12 Florida airports, with airports in Orlando (129 guns), Fort Lauderdale (120 guns) and Tampa (102 guns) leading the way.
Nearly all of the guns discovered at checkpoints were loaded, the TSA said, and most had ammunition chambered.
""An accidental discharge could result in tragedy,"" the TSA's Koshetz said in a statement. ""Every passenger bares the responsibility of knowing exactly where their gun is before entering the security checkpoint.""
For many passengers, bringing guns to airports resulted in arrests and notices to appear in court.
Civil penalties from the TSA can reach $13,910 even if the passenger is not arrested, the TSA's news release said.
Firearms must be packed in checked luggage. The TSA outlines specific rules related to guns and ammunition on its website.

Rivers are drying up, but it’s not too late to help. Here’s where to start
By Ryan Bergeron, CNN
Updated 7:18 PM EST, Sun November 13, 2022
Water in Lake Powell, fed by the Colorado River, has dropped to levels not seen since the reservoir was filled in the 1960's.

CNN
 — 
The Mississippi River was running so low in October, you could walk to an island that should only be accessible by boat.
This summer, the Danube River that flows through much of central Europe got so shallow, you could see sunken warships from World War II at the bottom of it.
Water levels in Lake Mead dropped so much that human remains of victims who went missing decades ago have turned up. The Colorado River historically fills Lake Mead, but the nonprofit group American Rivers now lists that dwindling tributary as the “most endangered river in America.”
Sinjin Eberle of American Rivers says there are reports that the Colorado is “19% smaller than it was in the year 2000.”
From the Colorado River to the Yangtze River in China, the world has seen a dramatic dry-up this year due to water divergence and extreme weather brought on by climate change.
“Severe drought and lack of rain in many parts of the world and heat waves have exacerbated this issue,” says Josh Klemm of International Rivers. “But one hidden issue is that most (long) rivers around the world are kind of choked by large dams.”
These are some of the factors resulting in dried-up riverbeds and fears that a struggle for water access could be coming to some communities sooner rather than later. So what can be done and what can you do about it?
Organizations like American Rivers and International Rivers are protecting rivers, improving water access and empowering others to help keep waterways flowing.
But to get results, everyone must do their part.
The Mississippi River is experiencing record-low water levels.
There will be pain for everyone
Saving and protecting our water is a popular issue, but getting people to actually use less water is hard. For most people, seeing is believing, which is why one of the top tourist destinations in the world has become a focal point in this topic – the Grand Canyon.
“It’s one of the seven wonders of the world,” says Eberle. “One of the most iconic landscapes on the planet and to grapple with the idea that the river that helped create this place is a trickle hopefully would be a wake-up call.”
Eberle doesn’t think the Colorado River will completely dry up, but if changes aren’t made, one day it could be the Colorado Creek instead of River.
Right now, many people rely on water from that river. According to American Rivers, it provides drinking water for one in ten Americans. Los Angeles, Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Denver are just some of the cities bleeding the Colorado River dry before it can reach the Gulf of California.
Simply put, water restrictions must become tighter.
“Each state (needs to) agree to some significant cutbacks of water use. Everyone’s going to have to feel some pain. Everyone, every state, every sector needs to figure out how to do more with less water,” says Amy Souers Kober of American Rivers. “Everyone keep working together. Keep talking. Keep trying to figure out solutions.”
These organizations are also making sure all voices get heard, ensuring that Indigenous and small communities are not left holding the short straw. One way they are trying to improve water access to all is through dam removals and opposing dam construction around the world.

Improving access
Along the Kunene River on the Namibia/Angola border in Africa, local groups are challenging construction of a dam which could cut them off from food and water.
“There’s many actors: (from) indigenous community-level to big organizations,” International Rivers’ Africa Program Director Siziwe Mota tells CNN. “And all these efforts are really critical to successfully building resilience to climate change – and guaranteeing food security for the millions of people around the world whose livelihoods and food sources are sustained by rivers.”
In the US, dams in the Klamath River, which flows through Oregon and California, will begin to be removed in 2023.
“The Klamath River was once one the biggest salmon-producing rivers on the west coast. It’s been blocked by four dams for 100 or so years. The salmon has been devastated, but even more devastating has been the impact on the river’s indigenous people,” says Kober. “It’s going to revitalize and reconnect these people.”
The removal of dams will give more water access to more people and allow the river to go back to its natural state.
A growing trend internationally is the fight for the legal rights of rivers as living beings. In New Zealand, the Whanganui River was granted rights as a legal person and other countries such as Bangladesh and India have made similar moves.
There’s even a Universal Declaration on the Rights of Rivers that you can sign to help rivers around the world.
The biggest impacts, however, result from local action.
Think, act & eat locally
According to Eberle, the most important way to help our waters is something that can be done daily.
“The best thing (people) can do to help the river(s), that they can do every day, is to eat more local food and keep their food choices more locally oriented.”
Searching out more locally grown food can help establish better relationships between farmers, consumers and their communities.
“We’re helping farmers and cities be more efficient with the water they use,” says Kober. “There’s a lot we can do to tighten up the system so that there’s no water waste at all.”
Getting involved politically and requesting leaders make smart water management decisions is an important step. Eberle notes that city councils and local leaders are good places to start.
But when voting on any level, look for candidates who want to take action on water sustainability and infrastructure as well.
Kober says that American Rivers’ work on the national level stresses funding for infrastructure to ensure clean drinking water for all communities, citing two American cities where residents have faced unsafe supply.
“So we never have another Flint, Michigan or Jackson, Mississippi.”

Support
Besides donating money, volunteering with local chapters of organizations and regional waterkeepers is not only a good way to take action, but as Josh Klemm from International Rivers says, “a great way to see the broader picture.” Having firsthand knowledge of the regional issues around you and knowing that they are also taking place on a larger scale can help when it’s time to choose which candidate to vote for – and even what’s for dinner.
Overall, understanding that the issue is bigger than one river and bigger than the Grand Canyon is the key to making sure everyone has access to clean water.
“It appears from reading a lot that the climate, the warming is accelerating; it could get worse,” says Eberle “Yet the population is still growing, and those two things combined, we’re going to have to find ways to keep all of these systems working together somehow.”
Klemm agrees it’s “hard to be super-optimistic,” but adds “we’ve seen nature rebound in really amazing ways that can ultimately help communities to adapt to climate change. Unfortunately, you often need that reckoning first over the impacts before you can get to this point of actually restoring rivers to their natural state. “
Watching the Colorado River in the Grand Canyon slowly evaporate along with images of rivers drying up around the world definitely causes a stir. Time will tell if it causes action.

Explorers trudged the Atlantic Ocean searching for World War II artifacts lost at sea, but they stumbled on something else — a 20-foot-long piece of debris from the Space Shuttle Challenger, which was destroyed shortly after takeoff in 1986.
The History Channel and NASA revealed Thursday that the Challenger segment was discovered off Florida’s east coast during the filming of a new series called “The Bermuda Triangle: Into Cursed Waters.” The series is set to premiere this month on the History Channel.
The Challenger broke apart after its launch on January 28, 1986, killing all seven crew members aboard, including a teacher was set to become the first civilian in space. TV viewers, especially students in schools across the US, watched a live broadcast of the blast in horror that morning.
“NASA currently is considering what additional actions it may take regarding the artifact that will properly honor the legacy of Challenger’s fallen astronauts and the families who loved them,” the space agency said in a news release.
Mike Barnette, an underwater explorer who led the crew that found the shuttle artifact, remembers watching the tragedy on TV in his high school classroom. He called it “sobering” to realize that his team found a scrap from the spacecraft — the first debris to be discovered since pieces from the shuttle washed ashore in 1996.

“I can almost smell the smells of that day,” Barnette told CNN in a phone interview Thursday, referring to the day the Challenger exploded. “It was just so burned into my brain.”
Barnette and his team of investigators set off in March to search suspected shipwreck sites in the Bermuda Triangle, a swath of the northern Atlantic Ocean said to be the site of dozens of shipwrecks and plane crashes. The team also set its sights on one area outside the triangle, just off Florida’s Space Coast, where NASA has launched rockets since its inception.
The team was searching for a WWII-era rescue plane that mysteriously disappeared in December 1945, but a more modern object partially covered by sand on the seafloor sparked interest and further investigation from the dive team, according to the History Channel.
During the first dive, Barnette said a storm caused the water to turn so murky it was like swimming in Guinness beer. “We had terrible visibility,” he said.
The divers carried out a second excursion in May and finally captured clear footage of the wreckage. They brought evidence of their discovery to retired NASA astronaut Bruce Melnick, a longtime friend of Barnette’s, who immediately suggested it could be detritus from the Challenger disaster.
Distinctive square tiles from the Challenger tipped the explorers off, suggesting they had uncovered a large chunk of the orbiter’s underbelly. The underbelly was coated in thousands of silicon tiles protecting the shuttle from heat as it returned into the Earth’s atmosphere from space.
The team turned its findings over to NASA in August, and the space agency recently confirmed the origins of the debris after reviewing footage from the dive, according to a news release.
The final Challenger mission was set to carry seven people into space — NASA astronauts Francis “Dick” Scobee, Michael Smith, Ronald McNair, Ellison Onizuka, Judith Resnik and Gregory Jarvis as well as Christa McAuliffe, a New Hampshire schoolteacher who was set to become the first citizen space shuttle passenger as part of a new NASA program.

But 73 seconds after takeoff from its Florida launch site, the Challenger exploded, killing everyone on board. A NASA investigation later revealed a rubber “O-ring” seal on one of Challenger’s solid rocket boosters had failed because it was exposed to unusually low temperatures while the space shuttle sat on the launchpad. It caused a leak of highly explosive gases, which ultimately led to the catastrophic explosion.
“While it has been nearly 37 years since seven daring and brave explorers lost their lives aboard Challenger, this tragedy will forever be seared in the collective memory of our country. For millions around the globe, myself included, Jan. 28, 1986, still feels like yesterday,” NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said in a statement.
“This discovery gives us an opportunity to pause once again, to uplift the legacies of the seven pioneers we lost, and to reflect on how this tragedy changed us. At NASA, the core value of safety is — and must forever remain — our top priority, especially as our missions explore more of the cosmos than ever before.”
The six-part series “The Bermuda Triangle: Into Cursed Waters” premieres at 10 p.m. ET on November 22 on the History Channel.

Filmmaker Paul Haggis is ordered to pay at least $7.5 million after being found liable in a sexual assault case involving a former publicist
By Amy Simonson, CNN
Updated 2:57 AM EST, Fri November 11, 2022
Screenwriter and film director Paul Haggis arrives at court for a sexual assault civil lawsuit, Wednesday, Nov. 2, 2022, in New York.

CNN
 — 
A jury found filmmaker Paul Haggis liable in a sexual assault case that was brought forward by a former publicist who alleged he raped her after a movie premiere in 2013.
The jury ordered the Oscar-winning screenwriter to pay Haleigh Breest at least $7.5 million in damages Thursday, according to attorneys for both Breest and Haggis.
Breest brought the case under the New York City Victims of Gender-Motivated Violence Protection Act.
Attorney Ilann Maazel, who represents Breest, told CNN by phone, “We’re grateful. We’re thankful. The jury was methodical and did justice today. We are proud, not just for Haleigh but for the entire #MeToo movement.”
In a statement to CNN, Haggis’s attorney, Priya Chaudhry said, “We are disappointed and shocked by this verdict.”
“It was impossible for Mr. Haggis to get a fair trial once the judge allowed the statements of 4 other women who never went to the police, never took any action against him, and 3 of 4 never even came into the courtroom,” the attorney added. “They used this to distort the truth, assassinate Mr. Haggis’ character, paint him as a monster, and use a ‘where there’s smoke, there’s fire’ strategy. No one could have had a fair trial in that courtroom under those circumstances. This is a shameful exploitation of the #MeToo movement where political sentiment trumps facts.”
Breest alleged that Haggis sexually assaulted her on the evening of January 31, 2013, in his Manhattan apartment when she was 26 years old – “less than half Mr. Haggis’s age,” according to the complaint filed in the state Supreme Court’s branch in New York County in 2017.
“The emotional and psychological damage to Ms. Breest from the attack cannot be overstated: it has been profound and lasting,” the complaint said.
The incident occurred after Haggis and Breest were at a movie premiere, according to the complaint. Toward the end of the event, Haggis offered Breest a ride home, the complaint alleges.
Once in his vehicle, Haggis invited Breest over for a drink.
“Ms. Breest told him she was willing to go to a public bar, but stated she did not want to go to his apartment. Mr. Haggis insisted they go to his apartment,” the complaint said.
Breest “relented” after being “faced with his persistence” and after recognizing that he was a “powerful member of the Hollywood elite who could influence her career,” according to the complaint.
The complaint alleges that Haggis made unwanted sexual advances and forcibly kissed her.
“She repeatedly told him ‘No’ but he would not stop,” the complaint said.
Haggis got Breest into the bedroom where he forced himself on her and ultimately raped her despite her efforts to push him off, the complaint alleges.
Maazel told CNN that the punitive damage trial will likely continue Monday where he expects Haggis to take the stand.
Haggis is a director, producer and screenwriter. His film credits include “Crash,” which earned him Oscars for best picture and best original screenplay at the 2006 Academy Awards. He also received a nomination for his screenplay for the multi-Oscar-winning “Million Dollar Baby.”
The filmmaker was detained in Italy over sexual assault allegations earlier this year while he was there to attend a film festival. An attorney for Haggis denied the allegations.

Tina Kotek of Oregon will be one of first out lesbian governors in US, CNN projects
By Maeve Reston, CNN
Updated 6:55 PM EST, Fri November 11, 2022

 — 
Democrat Tina Kotek will win the open gubernatorial race in Oregon, CNN projects, becoming one of the nation’s first out lesbian governors along with Democrat Maura Healey, who clinched the Massachusetts governorship Tuesday.
Kotek’s Republican opponent, Christine Drazan, conceded the race Friday. The contest to succeed term-limited Democratic Gov. Kate Brown in the deep-blue state turned unexpectedly difficult for Kotek after the independent candidacy of former state Sen. Betsy Johnson made for competitive three-way race.
“I want to express my deepest gratitude to all those who supported me and put their trust in our campaign. I also want to assure Oregonians that every vote will be counted and that their voices were heard in this election. Unfortunately, given what we know about the ballots outstanding, the math for a comeback simply does not add up,” Drazan said in a statement.
No one expected Oregon – a state that President Joe Biden won by 16 percentage points in 2020 – to be difficult terrain for Democrats, especially since Republicans have not won the governor’s office since 1982. But Johnson, a former Democrat, proved to be an unusually strong contender who kept pace in fundraising with her two rivals in this three-way all-women matchup with donations from business leaders, including Nike founder Phil Knight.
Meet the history-makers of the 2022 midterm elections
Brown’s unpopularity in the state combined with Johnson’s presence in the race vaulted Drazan, a former state House minority leader, into a fierce contest with Kotek, the former Democratic House speaker. Republicans comprise only about a quarter of the electorate, while Democrats make up about 34% and nonaffiliated Oregonians account for nearly 35%, according to the most recent figures from the Oregon secretary of state.
But Oregonians have been unnerved by the problems with homelessness and the rise in violent crime in Portland. The city’s downtown also still has not recovered from the impact of pandemic-era business closures and the more than 100 days of protests against police brutality – some of them violent – that followed the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer in 2020.
Drazan sought to capitalize on the disquiet about those issues, arguing that the state’s troubles stem from single-party control over about a decade that has led to a lack of accountability.
But Kotek argued that Drazan was too extreme for Oregon – highlighting her opposition to abortion rights, for example. Rather than demonstrating an ability to work with both sides, Kotek also said that Drazan demonstrated obstructionist tendencies when she led a legislative walkout in 2020 to protest a climate bill. Kotek argued that Drazan’s move effectively killed legislation that would have advanced the state’s efforts to improve homelessness, among other issues. (Drazan’s campaign said that allegation was an excuse.)
Biden campaigned for Kotek during a swing through the western states, urging voters to “stay ahead of the curve” as a progressive state by electing the former House speaker.

China scraps Covid flight bans, cuts quarantine for inbound travelers

 — 
China has reduced the amount of time travelers entering the country must spend in quarantine and removed a major restriction on international flights, in a sign of a limited easing of its stringent zero-Covid policy.
The new measures were announced Friday following a meeting by the ruling Communist Party’s top decision-making body, during which leaders vowed to maintain Covid protocols while stressing the need to minimize economic and social disruptions.
The long-awaited announcement, however, does not explicitly mention when the changes will take effect.
China is the last major economy to adhere to a zero-Covid policy, using snap lockdowns, mass testing, extensive contact-tracing and quarantines to stamp out infections as soon as they emerge.
The zero-tolerance approach has faced increasing challenges from highly transmissible new variants, and its heavy economic and social costs have drawn mounting public backlash.
The easing of the measures will see authorities scrap the so-called “circuit breaker” mechanism, under which China-bound flights were suspended if an airline was found to carry a certain number of passengers who tested positive for Covid upon landing.
Inbound international passengers will also see their pre-departure test requirement reduced from two to one, and their mandatory centralized quarantine upon arrival cut from seven days to five days, followed by another three days of home isolation.
International travelers who do not have a permanent address in China will still need to do a total of eight days of quarantine in hotels.
Markets responded positively to the changes as Covid-19 restrictions have kept international investors jittery. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index shot up 7% just after the noon break local time, while mainland China’s benchmark Shanghai Composite Index rose 2.5%.
Under the new guidelines, people who are identified as close contacts of Covid-19 cases will also have shortened quarantine at centralized government-operated facilities, down from seven days plus another three days at home, to five days and three days at home.
In addition, government health officials are no longer required to report secondary close contacts in many circumstances.

Flu season already hitting hard across half of the US and children’s hospitals are still feeling the pressure from respiratory illnesses

 — 
About half of the US – 22 states, along with Washington, DC, New York City and Puerto Rico – is reporting high or very high respiratory illness activity, as flu season sweeps through the country weeks earlier than usual.
Multiple respiratory viruses are circulating nationwide – including flu, RSV and the virus that causes Covid-19 – and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention tweeted Thursday that flu is contributing to a “significant proportion” of that circulation.
RSV responsible for 1 in 50 child deaths under age 5, study estimates
And influenza activity continues to increase: After nearly doubling in the last week of October, the number of flu illnesses, hospitalizations and deaths this season took another significant jump in the first week of November. The CDC now estimates that there have been at least 2.8 million illnesses, 23,000 hospitalizations and 1,300 deaths from influenza as of November 5.
The flu is notoriously hard to predict.
“Among the people who study flu, there’s a little saying: ‘If you’ve seen one flu season, well, you’ve seen one flu season,’ ” said Dr. William Schaffner, a professor in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center and medical director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases. “The implication is that they’re all a little bit different from each other, and that’s certainly the case.”
This season, there have been about 5 flu hospitalizations for every 100,000 people, rates typically seen in December or January, CDC data shows. And in the most recent week, about 13% of lab tests – more than 1 in 8 – were positive for influenza, up from 9% the week before.
What you should know about getting a flu vaccine this year, according to an expert
Although the numbers are especially high for this time of year, experts say the trends are otherwise following an expected pattern, and the early arrival of flu season doesn’t necessarily mean it will last longer or be more severe.
“The picture is pretty consistent across our different pieces of surveillance. There’s nothing there that makes me think that this virus is really different and causing more severe disease than we see typically with flu,” said Lynnette Brammer, an epidemiologist who leads the CDC’s domestic influenza surveillance team. “Flu can cause severe outcomes, but it’s not out of proportion this year compared to previous years. It’s not like we’re seeing a lot of hospitalizations without a lot of illness.”
Flu activity has been highest in the South, CDC data shows. Data from Walgreens that tracks prescriptions for antiviral treatments such as Tamiflu suggests hotspots centered in Mississippi and Alabama, spreading from the Gulf Coast area, including Houston and New Orleans, up to Nashville.
As flu smolders in the South, RSV is showing early signs of slowing in the region, CDC data shows, even as it continues to ramp up in other parts of the country.
Nationwide, nearly 1 in 5 PCR tests for RSV were positive in the first week of November, reaching levels that the South saw a month ago. But in that region, fewer than 1 in 7 tests are now positive for RSV.
RSV is a common respiratory virus that can cause serious illness, especially in younger infants, and it’s kept pediatric hospitals more full than usual in recent weeks.
Opinion: The good and bad news on RSV, the newest viral villain in America
Despite the improvements in the South, overall burden on pediatric hospitals nationwide has not eased. More than three-quarters of pediatric hospital beds and pediatric ICU beds have been in use for the past few weeks – up from an average of about two-thirds full over the past two years, according to federal data.
On Thursday, Dr. Brian Cummings, medical director of the Department of Pediatrics at Mass General for Children, said they’ve seen around 2,000 cases of RSV in October, and more than 1,000 in the first week of November.
“It’s been escalating and been quite severe,” Cummings said during a news conference Thursday.
Most infections have been treated in urgent care facilities and in the emergency department, and people are sent home, Cummings said. “But even if just 10 percent of those need hospitalization, it creates a lot of stress on health care facilities, and so what we are seeing is we’ve had over 250 hospitalizations for RSV alone on top of the other circulating viruses,” he said.
The pediatric ICU is full, Cummings said, and seven patients are waiting to be transferred in.
Across the country, the threat of Covid-19, while significantly less than it was a year ago, remains.
Nearly 25,000 people were admitted to the hospital with Covid-19 in the first week of November, according to CDC data, a pace that’s forecast to hold steady for the next month, at least.

As multiple respiratory viruses continue to spread, experts emphasize the importance of vaccination, which is available for two of the three viruses in heavy circulation. But those numbers are lower than ideal.
One in 5 people still hasn’t gotten their first Covid-19 vaccine shot, CDC data shows, and less than 10% of the US population has gotten the updated Covid-19 booster.
And millions fewer flu vaccines have been distributed this season than at this point in previous years.
“You worry when you have an early season that people just haven’t had time to get vaccinated,” Brammer said. “But vaccine is the best tool that we have to prevent these severe outcomes.”

KFC Germany apologizes for advertising a Kristallnacht promotion
By Danielle Wiener-Bronner, CNN Business

 — 
KFC Germany apologized for an “unacceptable” message sent to customers on Wednesday, which appeared to tie a sales promotion to the annual commemoration of Kristallnacht.
KFC app users in the country received a message encouraging them to mark the day with crispy chicken and cheese from KFC, according to Twitter users who shared screengrabs of the message in German. The initial message was apparently followed by another, saying the first was an error.
Kristallnacht, often translated as “Night of Broken Glass,” refers to a series of violent raids by the Nazi regime on Jewish businesses, homes and synagogues in 1938.
“Earlier today an automated push notification was accidently [SIC] issued to KFC app users in Germany that contained an obviously unplanned, insensitive and unacceptable message,” KFC Germany said in a statement emailed to CNN Business. “We understand and respect the gravity and history of this day, and remain committed to equity, inclusion and belonging for all.”
“We sincerely apologise,” the statement continued.
KFC Germany didn’t confirm the language used in the alert.
The company explained that it relies on a “semi-automated content creation process linked to calendars that include national observances,” adding that “in this instance, our internal review process was not properly followed, resulting in a non-approved notification being shared.”
KFC Germany said yesterday that it suspended app communications while it put its process under review to make sure something like this doesn’t happen again.
In this case, the company was able to blame an automated system for the mistake. But brands often get their messaging wrong around holidays or memorial days, especially ones that commemorate a painful occasion.
Juneteenth, which marks the end of slavery in the United States, became a federal holiday last year.
Brands rushed to create messages and products for the holiday this year, and many missed the mark. Some relied on racist tropes to mark the occasion and others treated it like a glib celebration, leaving people disappointed and offended.
KFC’s message resulted in similar outrage among some German customers and has been widely criticized on social media.

Here’s what’s getting more expensive at the grocery store

 — 
Food is still getting more expensive, but at a slower pace than earlier this year.
In the month of October, food was .6% pricier compared to September, adjusting for seasonal swings, according to data released Thursday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
For the year through October, without seasonal adjustments, food got 10.9% more expensive, with groceries increasing 12.4% and restaurant prices jumping 8.6%.
The increases are less than the record highs clocked just a few months ago, but food prices are still outpacing the overall rate of inflation, which hit 7.7% for the year.
The Federal Reserve has been attempting to curb inflation by raising interest rates, but that doesn’t do much for grocery and restaurant prices.
Egg prices have been especially high this year.

When it comes to food, a number of far-flung factors are disrupting supply.
Extreme heat and drought and a deadly avian flu are hurting some crops, as well as squeezing the supply of turkeys and egg-laying hens. Volatility in the grain market caused by the war in Ukraine as well as high energy prices, which impact fertilizer and transportation costs, are also raising food prices.
“Those things are still problematic,” said Tom Bailey, senior analyst of consumer foods with Rabobank.
Issues like these have led to soaring prices throughout the grocery store.
What’s getting more expensive, and what’s getting cheaper
In the year through October, eggs got a whopping 43% more expensive. Butter went up 26.7%, the price of flour went up 24.6%. Lettuce jumped 17.7%, potatoes popped 15.2% and poultry increased 14.9%. Bread, rice and coffee each went up 14.8%.
A handful of items, however, have seen decreases this year, especially in the meat aisle. Uncooked beef steak fell 6.9%, and beef and veal prices dropped 3.6%.
Some relief for consumers: Prices on a few grocery items are actually coming down
“We’ve seen a little bit of retailer easing of pricing for some of the beef products,” said Bailey. That’s a sign that they are trying to get customers into stores, he noted.
Even as prices cool down, shoppers are still feeling the pain.
“For the consumer, the share of spend of their wallet on food is still well above where we’ve been in the last two decades,” said Bailey.
In October, some prices jumped compared to the previous month.
Eggs saw the highest increase with a 10.1% jump from September. Lunch meats got 3.4% more expensive, lettuce went up 3.3%, tomatoes jumped 2.3% and flour rose 2%.
But several items got less expensive. Fresh fruit fell 2.4%. Uncooked beef roasts and hot dogs both dropped 2.3%, breakfast sausage went down 2% and fresh doughnuts, sweet rolls and coffee cakes fell 1.9%.

Chris Rock to make history with Netflix’s first-ever live performance

CNN
 — 
Chris Rock is coming live to a screen near you.
Netflix announced Thursday that the legendary comedian will make history as the headliner of the streaming giant’s first-ever live, global streaming event.
“Chris Rock is one of the most iconic and important comedic voices of our generation,” Robbie Praw, Netflix’s vice president of stand-up and comedy formats, said in a statement. “We’re thrilled the entire world will be able to experience a live Chris Rock comedy event and be a part of Netflix history. This will be an unforgettable moment and we’re so honored that Chris is carrying this torch.”
It will be Rock’s second Netflix stand-up special. His first, “Chris Rock: Tamborine,’ debuted in February 2018.
Though this will be Netflix’s first time streaming one, it is no stranger to live comedy events.
“Netflix is a Joke: The Festival” took place in spring and featured more than 330 comedians who performed 295 shows across more than 35 venues in Los Angeles, including the first-ever stand-up show at Dodger Stadium. The event sold more than 260,000 tickets.
Rock has been on the road with his Ego Death World Tour and has a series of comedy tour dates scheduled for venues in California in December with friend and fellow comic Dave Chappelle.
Rock’s live Netflix comedy special is set to stream in early 2023.

Dave Chappelle’s representative says there is no ‘SNL’ writers boycott ahead of his hosting gig
By Lisa Respers France, CNN
Published 7:34 PM EST, Thu November 10, 2022

CNN
 — 
Dave Chappelle’s representative is pushing back on a report that claimed “Saturday Night Live” writers were staging a boycott ahead of his hosting the show this weekend.
On Wednesday, The New York Post, citing an anonymous source, reported writers on the show were going to sit out on the episode.
“We’ve seen nothing to support media reports of a writer’s boycott,” Chappelle’s rep told CNN in a statement. “In fact, the writers delivered over 40 sketches for Dave’s consideration and collaboration. Just as during Dave’s past ‘SNL’ appearances, you won’t want to miss it!”
It will be Chappelle’s third time hosting.
‘SNL’ made the announcement about his return to Studio 8H last week.
News of Chappelle’s hosting was met with some furor on social media given his controversial comments over the years about the transgender community, especially given that the show announced in September that it was adding its first non-binary cast member, comedian and actor Molly Kearney, and has a trans non-binary writer, Celeste Yim.
CNN has reached out to representatives for “SNL,” its creator Lorne Michaels, Kearney and Yim for comment.
Chappelle has made jokes about the trans community in sets over the years and found himself on the receiving end of backlash from some members of the LGBTQ+ community and allies.
Most recently, 2021 Netflix special “The Closer” increased the ire after Chappelle said he was “team TERF,” the abbreviated term for “trans-exclusionary radical feminist.”
“Gender is a fact,” Chappelle said during the special. “Every human being in this room, every human being on earth, had to pass through the legs of a woman to be on earth. That is a fact.”
Approximately 65 Netflix employees staged a walkout amid the controversy and, earlier this year, one venue canceled Chappelle’s planned appearance after receiving criticism over the decision to have him perform.
Netflix stood by its decision to stream the special.

Kevin Conroy, longtime voice of animated Batman, dies at 66
By Scottie Andrew, CNN
Published 4:13 PM EST, Fri November 11, 2022

 — 
Kevin Conroy, the man behind the gravelly bass voice of Batman and who popularized that unmistakable growl that separated Bruce Wayne from the Caped Crusader, has died, according to his representative Gary Miereanu. He was 66.
DC Comics also confirmed the news.
Conroy died Thursday, shortly after he was diagnosed with cancer, Miereanu said.
Conroy’s work in the role is the basis for every iteration of Batman popular culture has seen since. He played Wayne and his superheroic alter ego for years on TV, including on the beloved “Batman: The Animated Series,” and his influence can be heard in the performances of Christian Bale, Robert Pattinson and many more who’ve played the character.
But few actors can say they’ve played Batman quite as often as Conroy: He appeared in more than 400 episodes of TV as the voice – and once, embodiment – of the Dark Knight.
From Broadway to Batman
Before he was Batman, Conroy regularly performed the work of the Bard: A graduate of Julliard’s esteemed acting program, Conroy appeared in adaptations of Shakespearean works from “Hamlet” to “King Lear,” usually at the Old Globe in San Diego. He appeared on Broadway, too, in “Lolita” and “Eastern Standard.”
But it’s undoubtedly the Bat for which Conroy is best known. He played Batman in over 60 productions, according to DC (which shares parent company Warner Bros. Discovery with CNN). His first and most enduring addition to the Batman canon is “Batman: The Animated Series,” which ran from 1992-1996, according to DC. In all, he would play the Bat and Bruce in over 15 different animated series (totaling nearly 400 episodes) and 15 films, including “Batman: Mask of the Phantasm.”
He often played against Mark Hamill, who regularly voiced the Joker in animated projects, including the dark and disturbing “Batman: The Killing Joke.” The two had an obvious chemistry in their vocal performances that echoed the tug-of-war Joker and Batman often played.
Kevin Conroy voiced Batman in more than 400 episodes of TV and several films.
Warner Bros. Animation
“Kevin was perfection,” Hamill said in a statement to DC. “For several generations, he has been the definitive Batman. It was one of those perfect scenarios where they got the exact right guy for the exact right part, and the world was better for it.”
But Conroy wasn’t a Batman fan when he began his tenure – all he knew, he said, was Adam West’s campy portrayal from the 1960s. In a 2014 interview, he said he went in blind, one of hundreds of actors auditioning to voice the beloved superhero. To find the character, he turned to his Shakespearean training, saying he saw a bit of Hamlet in Bruce Wayne.
“I gave life to the character. I think I gave passion to the character,” he said in the 2014 interview. “I approached it from a purely acting perspective. A lot of the fans approach it from the whole ‘bible’ of Batman…It’s humbling to me.”
In 2019, Conroy finally appeared as a live-action Batman in a crossover episode of several DC TV properties, including “Arrow,” “Batwoman” and “Supergirl.” As a Bruce Wayne from a different universe, Conroy’s hero was battle-worn, depending on a robotic suit to help him walk after a “lifetime of injuries.”
In Batman, Conroy found courage to come out
Conroy related to his best-known character for another reason, too: Like Bruce Wayne, he also hid his insecurities behind a mask – he wasn’t comfortable coming out as gay due to homophobia within his industry. But being Batman helped him find his inner strength, he wrote in a short comic for DC.
“I often marveled at how appropriate it was that I should land this role. As a gay boy growing up in the ’50s and ‘60s, in a devoutly Catholic family, I’d grown adept at concealing parts of myself,” Conroy wrote in the comic, according to gaming outlet Kotaku.
Conroy later married Vaughn C. Williams, who survives him, according to DC.
Batman brought joy to others in times of need, too: A native New Yorker, Conroy felt called after the events of September 11 to work at a food relief station for first responders. One of the men he served recognized him, but a colleague didn’t believe that Conroy really was the voice of Batman. So Conroy performed one of his most famous lines, in that signature bass: “I am vengeance. I am the night. I am Batman!”
And with that, he proved he was, indeed, Batman and delighted first responders.
He’s a beloved Batman, fans say
Fans and fellow voice actors mourned Conroy’s loss online.
Clancy Brown, the voice of Mr. Crabs on “Spongebob Squarepants” and Lex Luthor in several animated series, called Conroy his “hero.” Liam O’Brien, famous for voicing anime series like “Naruto” and several video games, said he’s not sure he’d be a voice actor if he hadn’t been “so inspired by Kevin Conroy.”
Tara Strong, known for her voice work in “Rugrats” and “Loki” and worked with Conroy on “The New Batman Adventures,” shared a photo of Conroy lying on her lap with a smile. “He IS #Batman,” she wrote.
Hamill concurred. Many famous men have taken up Batman’s mantle – Bale, Pattinson, Ben Affleck, George Clooney among them – but few have gotten to explore all of the superhero’s emotions and traumas over several decades. For many fans of Batman, Conroy was the first iteration of the Dark Knight they ever knew and loved.
“He will always be my Batman,” Hamill said.
During the early days of the pandemic, Conroy shared a clip of himself reciting Shakespeare’s Sonnet 30 from his garden. A bittersweet reflection on lost loved ones and time passed, it ends on a hopeful note, all of which Conroy conveyed in his 45-second, off-the-cuff clip.
“But if the while I think on thee, dear friend/All losses are restor’d, and sorrows end.”

Donald Trump believes we should terminate “all rules, regulations and articles, even those found in the Constitution” to overturn the 2020 election. That was his view on 1/6 and remains his view today. No honest person can now deny that Trump is an enemy of the Constitution.

A Texas woman found guilty of killing a pregnant woman to take her unborn child has been sentenced to death
By Rebekah Riess, CNN
Updated 9:59 AM EST, Fri November 11, 2022
Taylor Rene Parker was found guilty of capital murder for killing a woman and taking her baby, who also died.

 — 
A Texas woman convicted of killing a pregnant woman and then taking her unborn baby, who also died, has been sentenced to death, court records show.
A Bowie County jury last month after about an hour of deliberations found Taylor Rene Parker guilty of capital murder in the deaths of Reagan Michelle Simmons and her baby, the district attorney’s office previously said. The same jury was then tasked with choosing her sentence – death or prison without parole.
The jury handed down the death sentence Wednesday, online court records show.
“Based on the strong defense case we put on at sentencing, we are disappointed in the verdict, but we respect the jury’s findings after a long, factually and emotionally difficult trial,” Parker’s attorney, Jeff Harrelson, said.
With her death sentence, Parker becomes one of just seven women on Texas’ death row, according to statistics from the Texas Department of Criminal Justice.
According to a probable cause affidavit, Parker had told her boyfriend and others she was pregnant, held a gender reveal party and on October 9, 2020, said she was going to a hospital in Idabel, Oklahoma, to preregister for labor to be induced.
Jury finds Texas woman guilty of killing pregnant woman to take her unborn child
That same morning, police in New Boston, Texas, west of Texarkana, received a 911 call from a woman who reported someone had killed her daughter, the affidavit said. Responding officers found Simmons, who they learned had been 34 weeks pregnant, with a large cut along her abdomen and the baby no longer in her womb.
Texas state troopers conducted a traffic stop of a car that morning and found Parker holding a baby in her lap and “the umbilical cord was connected to the infant, which appeared to be coming out of the female’s pants, as if she gave birth to the child,” the affidavit said.
Parker and the baby were taken to the hospital in Idabel, where hospital staff determined Parker had not given birth to the child. Parker then admitted to being in a “physical altercation” with the victim and abducting the unborn baby from the victim’s body.
Authorities determined Parker caused the deaths of both Simmons and her baby “due to the inability to provide necessary care to the child,” the affidavit said.
“We are just so thankful justice has been served today, for not only our family, our friends, the prosecution team, our community,” Jessica Brooks, the mother of the victim, told CNN affiliate KSLA, which reported the sentencing trial lasted 25 days and included 142 witnesses.
According to the station, prosecutors argued for death, saying Parker would not change, while the defense, in seeking the provide jurors with context from Parker’s life, said she had traumatic issues that had not been addressed.
“I’m overwhelmed with happiness it’s over,” the victim’s sister Emily Simmons said, per KSLA, “because (Parker) has been such a burden in our life for so long now that I haven’t been able to think about my sister without thinking about her.”

Harvard museum will return Native American hair samples, apologizes for ‘complicity’ in objectification of Native peoples
By Rob Frehse, CNN

 — 
A Harvard University museum apologized Thursday for its “complicity” in the objectification of Native peoples and will return hair clippings of about 700 Native American children who were forced to attend United States boarding schools in the 1930’s.
“The Peabody Museum apologizes to Indigenous families and tribal nations for our complicity in the objectification of Native peoples and for our more than 80-year possession of hair taken from their relatives,” the museum said in a statement.
Native American children were renamed, told not to use indigenous languages and had their hair cut at more than 400 boarding schools in the United States that forced assimilation in the 19th and 20th centuries, according to the Department of Interior.
In May, the department released a long-awaited review of past efforts by the federal government to assimilate Native American children into White American society by separating them from their families and stripping them of their languages and cultures.
Interior Department says Native American children were forced into assimilation at 408 federal boarding schools
On Thursday, the museum said it recognizes the cultural and spiritual significance that hair holds for many Native American communities and is “fully committed” to return the hair to tribal communities and families.
“Between 1930-1933, anthropologist George Edward Woodbury, Curator of the State Historical Society of Colorado, was researching potential connections between Indigenous communities to study human variation and support early anthropological theories around the peopling of North America,” according to the museum.
The nearly 1,500 hair clippings were mostly taken from living people in Asia, Central America, North America, Oceania and South America, the museum said.
Woodbury and his wife published a paper on the topic in 1932, according to the museum. In 1935, Woodbury came to Harvard and served as a lecturer and research fellow in Anthropology and in 1938, he left the university and the discipline of anthropology. The collection of hair samples remained at the Peabody, the museum said.
Harvard noted that anthropologists and others have researched human hair variations for several centuries and that many of those hair sample collections are at museums and other institutions.
What Indigenous Peoples' Day means to Native Americans
“Much of this work was carried out to support, directly or indirectly, scientific racism,” the museum said. “Descriptions and measurements of hair types were used to justify racial categories and hierarchies.”
The museum set up a website listing tribal affiliations and the sites where the hair was collected in the United States to help “support the reconnection of families and tribal nations with their relatives to facilitate the process of healing.”
The National Native American Boarding School Healing Coalition reacted to the museum’s decision in a post on social media.
“While we recognize that the Peabody Museum’s apology and commitment to returning these materials back to their relatives and Tribal Nations is an essential first step, we need to see meaningful, urgent, and ongoing responses to the extractive and dehumanizing collections practices so commonly seen in anthropological, archaeological, and museum sciences.”

New car prices are finally coming down. But not by much

 — 
New car prices are finally coming down. A little, anyway.
Cars are still selling, on average, for more than the manufacturers’ sticker prices, but at least they’re closer, according to analysts. And a number of car brands are now selling for below sticker price, something that was once normal but that had become rare over the past year or more.
For the first six months of this year, new car prices averaged $700 over the manufacturer’s suggested retail price, or MSRP, according to Ivan Drury, an analyst with Edmunds.com. Over the past few months, though, prices have fallen to only about $230 over MSRP, on average, according to Edmunds.
Some car brands are still going for much more, though. Land Rover models, on average, still sell for $4,500 over sticker price while Kia models sell for about $1,600 over sticker price. Hondas are selling for about $1,360 over their suggested retail price, on average, according to data from Edmunds.com.

In general, buyers shopping for mainstream, non-luxury vehicles tend to pay more over sticker than luxury car buyers, according to analysts at Cox Automotive. While luxury car buyers, who make up about 17% of the market, still pay higher prices, overall – $66,000 compared to an average of $44,000 for non-luxury brands – they were, at least, paying closer to sticker. The slight difference in price mark-ups may reflect the fact that non-luxury cars, in many cases, have appointments and features similar to those in luxury cars, said Cox spokesman Mark Schirmer. Dealers are now simply demanding that customers pay for what the product actually provides rather than a lower price the manufacturer has dictated. He added that luxury car dealers may place more value on the customer’s experience and, so, be less aggressive on pricing than mainstream dealers.
Overall, Cox’s auto pricing analysts show buyers paying $527 over sticker on average. That’s higher than what Edmunds claims but, again, lower than earlier in the year. (The difference has to do with methods of analysis and specific data sources, according to spokespeople for both companies.)
Dealerships asking customers to pay over sticker price for a car is normally considered unusual, something only done for particularly desirable or hard-to-find models like high-performance sports cars. For the past 17 months, though, according to Cox Automotive, vehicle inventory shortages have enabled car dealers to push prices above MSRP. Unlike most things, car prices are usually individually negotiated by dealers leading to broad price flexibility. Manufacturing slowdowns caused by supply chain problems – car companies have had trouble getting some parts, like computer chips – have meant few cars are available to sell and that’s given car dealers enormous negotiating power.
Some manufacturers, like Ford and Honda, have noticed customers’ willingness to deal with low inventories, higher prices, and longer wait times to get their vehicles. Executives from those companies have said they don’t plan to ever go back the days when dealer lots were filled with cars and SUVs waiting to be sold.
While still tight, especially for some manufacturers like Honda, vehicle inventories are at their highest since June of 2021, according to Cox.
“If consumers are flexible on make and model, it will be possible to find a good deal at year-end sales events,” said Rebecca Rydzewski, for Cox Automotive.
Some big SUVs like the Lincoln Navigator and Volvo XC90 are selling for relatively large discounts of $1,400 and $1,900 below sticker, on average, according to Edmunds. Volvo and Lincoln, in general, are the two car brands offering the biggest discounts from MSRP, according to data from Edmunds. Buick is another brand offering fairly big discounts, according to Cox.
Kia, once the 'value' brand, now has the biggest price markups
In terms of new car loans, customers can now get fairly good interest rates on shorter-term loans of 36 to 48 months, said Drury. Those shorter loan terms result in higher monthly payments, of course, but with the benefit that buyers can save thousands of dollars in interest, especially with rising interest rates. The Federal Reserve is expected to continue raising its benchmark rate which can, in turn, push up interest rates on things like auto loans. An individual’s own credit rating has the biggest impact on how much auto lenders charge, but there are still good financing deals for the well qualified. according to Bankrate.com. Offers of 0% interest rates have increased sharply at the beginning of this month, according to a report from Cox Automotive.
Used car prices are also starting to come down a bit, something that could prod new car shoppers back into the market, said Drury.
“Consumers who have been waiting on the sidelines watching their trade-in appreciate will now start to feel the need to act if they want to extract maximum trade-in value from their vehicle,” he said.
With inflation and high gas prices, owners of cheaper, fuel-efficient models will get the best values for their trade-ins, Cox Automotive analyst Brian Finkelmeyer wrote in a recent report. Those trading in bigger, more expensive vehicles could be disappointed, though.
“Used-car inventories across the country are currently bloated with expensive used merchandise priced over $35,000,” he wrote.
It will be a long wait before shopping returns to the way it used to be, with buyers able to negotiate steep discounts on most vehicles, said Edmunds’ Drury. That won’t start happening until the end of 2023 or even into 2024, he said.

US Customs and Border Protection commissioner is asked to resign, sources say

 — 
Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas asked US Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Chris Magnus to resign this week, two sources familiar with the discussions tell CNN.
Magnus has been criticized internally for being out of touch with the agency and publicly for the handling of the US-Mexico border. During his tenure, officials have told CNN they believed Magnus seemed disengaged and wasn’t joining some internal meetings at a critical time for the agency.
In a statement to the Los Angeles Times, Magnus said he planned to stay in the agency.
“I am excited about the progress I made and look forward continuing that work,” he said.
Though Magnus remains at the agency, Homeland Security Deputy Secretary John Tien and CBP Deputy Commissioner Troy Miller are carrying out his day-to-day duties, according to one person familiar with the matter. Direct reports to Magnus are also now reporting to Tien.
CNN has reached out to the Department of Homeland Security and the White House for comment.
President Joe Biden tapped Magnus, who served as police chief in Tucson, Arizona, to helm CBP – the largest federal law enforcement agency and the second-largest revenue-collecting source in the federal government.
Migrants from three countries are driving the spike in encounters at the southern border, swamping a backlogged immigration system
Late last year, the Senate confirmed Magnus after months of confirmation setbacks that left the agency with a void at the top amid a record number of border arrests.

Magnus came in at a time when Customs and Border Protection, which is under the Department of Homeland Security, faced an influx of migrants crossing the US-Mexico border and grappled with travel restrictions stemming from the coronavirus pandemic.
US Border Patrol, a division of Customs and Border Protection, made over 2.2 million arrests in fiscal year 2022 for unlawful crossings on the US-Mexico border, the highest annual number of apprehensions on record.

4 Supreme Court justices who voted to reverse Roe get warm reception at Federalist Society dinner

 — 
Four Supreme Court justices who voted to strike down Roe v. Wade joined the Federalist Society Thursday night as the conservative legal group celebrated its 40th anniversary and resoundingly applauded the high court’s June decision.
Justice Samuel Alito, who penned the court’s majority decision that overturned Roe, did not directly address the ruling during his remarks at the black-tie dinner in Washington, DC. But he received a standing ovation from the audience when former Michigan Supreme Court Chief Justice Stephen Markman invoked the decision.
“You know, I’ve heard it said by some in recent months that the Dobbs decision will be forever an indelible part of Justice Alito’s legacy,” Markman said.
Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh were also in attendance, as was Justice Amy Coney Barrett, who also delivered remarks during the dinner, which the group hosted in celebration of its longevity and in honor of the late conservative Justice Antonin Scalia. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell was also in attendance.

The Federalist Society was founded in 1982 by conservative students and professors, some of whom believed in originalism, a philosophy tied to the framers’ view of the Constitution in the 18th century. The group’s imprint on the Supreme Court is significant and arguably unrivaled: Every one of the current Republican appointees, including Chief Justice John Roberts, was vetted in some way by the Federalist Society working with the respective GOP administrations. The three Trump appointees were more directly hand-picked by Federalist Society stalwarts.
For his part, McConnell, when he was the Senate majority leader, was a crucial partner to the Federalist Society in choosing judicial candidates and getting them confirmed, particularly during the Trump administration.
Alito spoke fondly of the legal group during Thursday’s dinner, remembering time spent having meals with the Federalist Society’s DC chapter at a Chinese restaurant in the city. He brought with him a fortune cookie he said he kept from that very restaurant.
“I’m going to open it and read the fortune. I hope it will tell us something about, I hope it will foretell the future of the Federalist Society,” Alito said, before reading from the fortune: “‘You will flourish, grow and travel to all parts of the country. You will spread wisdom and civility and will live as long as your work is needed.’”
Barrett, like Alito, received a standing ovation as she took the stage, using the moment to highlight the opposition she has faced in recent months.
“It’s really nice to have a lot of noise made not by protesters outside of my house,” she said.
She went on to discuss her own connection to the group, which she joined while she was a law professor at Notre Dame Law School.
“I have benefited immensely by the efforts of those who put in so much work at the beginning, including my dear Judge Silberman,” Barrett said, referring to the federal judge for whom she clerked following law school.
CNN’s Joan Biskupic contributed to this report.

Ukrainian troops sweep into key city of Kherson after Russian forces retreat, dealing blow to Putin

CNN
 — 
Ukrainian forces swept into the key city of Kherson on Friday as Russian troops retreated to the east, delivering a major victory to Kyiv and marking one of the biggest setbacks for President Vladimir Putin since his invasion began.
Elated civilians who had survived months of Russian occupation descended on Kherson’s central square, hugging newly arrived Ukrainian soldiers, snapping selfies with them, and waving Ukrainian flags.
Footage of the jubilant scenes emerged hours after Russia announced it had withdrawn from the west bank of the Dnipro River in the strategic southern region of Kherson, leaving the regional capital of Kherson and surrounding areas to the Ukrainians.
The retreat represents a major blow for Putin’s war effort in Ukraine. Kherson was the only Ukrainian regional capital that Russian forces had captured since February’s invasion. Their withdrawal east across the Dnipro cedes large swathes of land that Russia has occupied since the early days of the war, and that Putin had formally declared as Russian territory just five weeks ago.
“The Ukrainian flag is raised in Kherson city. From now on, the Ukrainian flag will appear on all buildings in Kherson. This is what we have dreamed of from the first days of occupation,” said Serhiy Khlan, a member of Ukraine’s Kherson regional council.
On Friday evening, Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky posted a night-time video of celebrations in Kherson city, where a crowd was waving flags and chanting “ZSU,” the Ukrainian acronym for the armed forces.
He called it “a historic day” for Ukraine. “We are returning the south of our country, we are returning Kherson.”
“As of now, our defenders are on the outskirts of the city. Just a little more to go and we will enter. But special units are already in the city,” Zelensky said.
Zelensky appealed to any Russian soldiers still on the west bank to surrender.
“We guarantee that you will be treated in accordance with the law and international standards. And to those Russian military who disguised themselves in civilian clothes and are hiding somewhere, I want to say that you cannot hide. We will find you anyway,” he said.
Ukrainian forces advanced through much of the Kherson region Friday, apparently encountering little or no resistance. Social media video from towns and villages throughout the region’s west bank shows troops being greeted by civilians.

Residents raised Ukrainian flags in Kherson city, which was occupied by Russia until Friday morning.
Twitter
Russia’s Defense Ministry announced earlier on Friday that its forces have completed their partial withdrawal from the Kherson region, after Moscow ordered the retreat Wednesday,
“In the Kherson direction, the move of Russian military units to the left bank of the Dnieper River was completed at 0500 [Moscow time] this morning,” the ministry said on its official Telegram channel, using the Russian spelling for the river.
“Not a single piece of military equipment or weaponry was left behind on the right [west] bank,” the statement added. “All Russian servicemen have moved to the left bank of the Dnieper.”
Social media video suggests otherwise, with Russian tanks, armored vehicles and crates of ammunition displayed by Ukrainian troops.
Ukraine has asserted that it carried out attacks against Russian troop concentrations that were withdrawing, but the Russian Defense Ministry said in a statement later on Friday that “despite the attempts of the enemy to disrupt the transfer of Russian troops, no losses among personnel, weapons, military equipment and materiel were allowed.”
It also claimed that the Ukrainian advance had been held back for several days, and that “manpower and military equipment of the Armed Forces of Ukraine on the right bank of the Dnieper are being hit by fire.”
Ukraine has not reported any incoming fire from the east bank Friday but said a missile attack on the city of Mykolaiv, close to the border with Kherson, killed seven people early Friday.
Earlier Friday, the Ukrainian military’s southern operational command said Russian forces had been “urgently loading into boats that seem suitable for crossing and trying to escape” across the river.
It was unclear whether all Russian troops had left Kherson and the wider region; Khlan said the city was “almost under the control of the Armed Forces of Ukraine” but warned that some Russian troops may have remained behind in civilian clothing.
He cautioned that many Russian troops “threw away their military uniforms, and are now hiding with civilian clothes on.”
“They will be plotting provocations, false-flag operations in the city,” he said. “There is a lot of work ahead on demining and clearing the city.” Residents of Kherson city with whom CNN has spoken in recent weeks confirmed that many Russian soldiers were using civilian clothing.
Ukraine’s military said it would proceed cautiously through Kherson region, and warned Russian troops were mining roads and destroying critical infrastructure as they retreated from the region.
“The Russian invaders continue their looting of settlements from which they are retreating,” spokesman for the General Staff of Ukraine’s Armed Forces Oleksandr Shtupun said. “The enemy is also trying to damage power lines, other transport and critical infrastructure facilities of Kherson region.”
Images and video on social media Friday also showed that the Antonivskyi Bridge, the main conduit over the Dnipro in the Kherson region, had been destroyed.
At least seven bridges in total, four of them crossing the River Dnipro, have been destroyed in the last 24 hours, Maxar Technologies satellite images and other photos show.
Two bridges, a vehicle and a railroad, that sit atop a dam at Nova Kakhovka were among those destroyed.
Water is flowing out of three sluice gates at the critical dam, which spans the Dnipro river, according to satellite images from Maxar Technologies obtained by CNN.
It’s unclear how the latest damage, which is close to the west bank, was caused. Local Telegram channels reported Thursday night the sound of explosions around the dam. Ukrainian forces do not appear they have taken control of the dam, which could cause considerable damage in the region if breached.
Alexander Kots, a reporter for the Russian pro-government tabloid Komsomolskaya Pravda embedded with Russian forces, posted a video on his Telegram channel standing on the crossing, showing the entire center section of the bridge destroyed. “Behind me are the two collapsed spans of (the) bridge,” Kots said. “They were likely blown up during the withdrawal of the Russian group of forces from the right bank to the left,” or western bank to eastern bank.
The entire center section of the bridge appears to have been destroyed.
Twitter
Sweeping losses
Russian forces have ceded about 40% of the Kherson region, which straddles the Dnipro, within a few days.
Now that Ukrainian forces have recaptured Kherson as far as the Dnipro river, the two sides face each other across the river over a distance of some 250 kilometers – from the area around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant to the edge of the Black Sea.
As Russian forces have fled, Ukrainian troops have pushed forward in their wake, capturing dozens of villages and settlements in Kherson region above the Dnipro.
The Ukrainian military on Friday recaptured another part of Kherson region, the village of Tyahinka near the strategic town of Nova Kakhovka, despite Russian forces destroying bridges to the village.
A video circulating on social media on Friday, geolocated and authenticated by CNN, showed Ukrainian forces being greeted by residents on the main highway in Tyahinka. The village is just 14 miles (20 km) west of the hydroelectric dam and bridges that stretch across the Dnipro river at Nova Kakhovka.
A number of photos, also geolocated and authenticated by CNN, show that the Ukrainian forces were able to make their way into the village despite the main highway’s bridge and a pedestrian bridge being destroyed by the Russians as they withdrew. Dozens of bridges across the Kherson region have been destroyed or disabled during the conflict.
Residents of the town of Bilozerka, on the western outskirts of Kherson city, raised a Ukrainian flag and ripped down Russian propaganda billboards on Friday, according to videos on social media geolocated by CNN.
One video showed a Ukrainian flag flying over a World War II memorial, while another showed residents tearing down a propaganda billboards with a young girl holding a Russian flag, which read: “Russia is here forever.”
The scenes of people greeting Ukrainian troops across the region were in sharp contrast to claims by Russian-appointed officials in Kherson six weeks ago that 87% of voters there supported integration into the Russian Federation, in a referendum widely condemned by the international community as a sham. Kherson was one of four Ukrainian regions illegally annexed by Russia in September.
Ukraine claims big gains in south, but fears retreating Russians will turn Kherson into 'city of death'
Kyiv officials had warned that retreating Russian troops could turn the regional capital of Kherson into a “city of death” on the way out, and an official in southern Ukraine warned residents Friday to be wary of quickly returning to recently liberated territory due to the threat of mines.
“There are a lot of mines in the liberated territories and settlements,” Vitaliy Kim, head of Mykolaiv region military administration, said on Telegram. “Don’t go there for no reason. There are casualties.”
Putin’s spokesperson on Friday insisted that the region remains part of Russia, despite the Russian withdrawal.
“This is a subject of the Russian Federation,” Dmitry Peskov said during a regular briefing with journalists. “It has been legally fixed and defined. There can be no changes here.”
Russia still controls a large portion of the Kherson region – the area east of the Dnipro River.
When asked directly whether Russia’s retreat was “humiliating” for President Vladimir Putin, Peskov replied: “No.”
CNN’s Darya Tarasova, Paul P. Murphy and Julia Kesaiva contributed to this report.

As major powers meet in Asia, the rest of the world is pressed to pick a side

 — 
World leaders are converging in Phnom Penh this weekend for the first in a series of international summits in Southeast Asia over the coming week, where divisions between major powers and conflict threaten to overshadow talks.
The first stop is the Cambodian capital where leaders from across the Indo-Pacific will meet alongside a summit of Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) leaders, followed next week by a meeting of the Group of 20 (G20) leaders in Bali and of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Bangkok.
The stacked diplomatic line-up will be a test of international appetite for coordination on issues like climate change, global inflation and rising food prices on the back of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and economic recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic – and the first time that all three events are being held in person since the outbreak began in 2020.
Sharp geopolitical divisions of the type not seen in decades loom over this political calendar, as the war in Ukraine has radically transformed Russia’s relationship with the West, the top two global economies US and China remain locked in intensifying competition, and the rest of the world is pressed to pick a side.
Whether Russian leader Vladimir Putin will make any appearance during the stretch of diplomatic dates remains uncertain. Both US President Joe Biden and Chinese leader Xi Jinping are expected to attend two of the summits in Southeast Asia – a region that has long been ground-zero for influence-jockeying between Beijing and Washington.
Biden lands in Cambodia to meet Asian allies ahead of Xi meeting
Xi is re-emerging on the world stage after years without travel during the pandemic, having secured a norm-breaking third term in power, while Biden heads east fresh from a better-than-expected performance by his party in the US midterm elections. Both would be expected to pitch their country as a stronger partner and more responsible global actor than the other.
The two will meet face-to-face on Monday on the sidelines of the G20, their first in-person encounter since Biden’s election, the White House said on Thursday. Beijing on Friday confirmed Xi’s travel plans to the G20 and APEC summits, and said he would hold bilateral meetings with Biden and several other leaders.
Talks between the two could help to avert an escalation of tensions between the powers. But for the leaders meeting during the string of summits in coming days, cinching robust agreements on tackling global issues – already a tough bargain at the best of times – will be a challenge.

Divided world
Even the most regional of the meetings, the ASEAN summit of Southeast Asian leaders – which kicked off in Phnom Penh on Friday and is slated to address strengthening regional stability as well as global challenges – will reflect fractured world politics, experts say.
But unlike the other major meetings, which may be more squarely focused on the fallout from the war in Ukraine, ASEAN leaders are entering the summit and related meetings this weekend under pressure to address a spiraling conflict within their own bloc: as Myanmar remains in turmoil and under military rule nearly two years after a brutal coup ousted the democratically elected government.
Differences between Southeast Asian countries on how to handle that conflict, compounded by their criss-crossing allegiances with great powers – and a reticence from the bloc to appear to take sides between the US and China – will all impact how much the group can agree on and what it can accomplish across the gamut of summits, experts say.
Biden to meet Xi on Monday for first high-stakes sit-down with Chinese leader
“Normally this season would be very exciting – you have three major world summits in Southeast Asia – Phnom Penh, Bali and Bangkok,” said Thitinan Pongsudhirak, director of the Institute of Security and International Studies at Chulalongkorn University’s Faculty of Political Science in Bangkok.
“But (ASEAN) is very much divided on Russian aggression, on the Myanmar coup crisis, on China’s belligerence in the South China Sea and so on, and this means that ASEAN is in bad shape,” he said.
At a United Nations vote last month, seven of the 10 ASEAN countries, including the Myanmar representative who is not backed by the ruling military, voted to condemn Russia’s annexation of four regions of Ukraine, while Thailand, Laos, and Vietnam abstained.
But ASEAN as a bloc has also taken a step to tighten ties with Kyiv at this week’s events, signing an amity and cooperation treaty with Ukraine in a ceremony with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba in Phnom Penh on Thursday.
The bloc aims to use consensus among its states as its strength when it brings larger world players to the table, for example in its adjacent East Asia Summit that brings together 18 Indo-Pacific countries, including Russia, China and the United States, and also meets this weekend.
“If ASEAN cannot get its house in order, if ASEAN cannot rein in a rogue member like the Myanmar military regime, then ASEAN loses its relevance,” Pongsudhirak said. “On the other hand, if ASEAN is united, if it can muster commitment and resolve … it can have a lot of pulling power.”
Conflict and competition in Southeast Asia
Nearly two years since the military coup crushed Myanmar’s fledgling democracy, rights groups and observers say freedoms and rights in the country have deteriorated sharply; state executions have returned and the number of documented violent attacks by the ruling military junta on civilian infrastructure, including schools, has surged.
Numerous armed rebel groups have emerged against the ruling military junta, while millions of people have resisted its rule through forms of civil disobedience.
The weekend’s summits in Phnom Penh will pull the conflict back into international focus, as Southeast Asian leaders try to find a path forward, after Myanmar’s ruling junta failed to implement a peace plan negotiated in April of last year. The country remains part of ASEAN, despite calls from rights groups for its ejection, but has been barred from sending political-level representatives to key events.

ASEAN foreign ministers held a last-ditch attempt to hash out a strategy late last month, with Cambodian Foreign Minister Prak Sokhonn, who chaired the meeting, stressing in a statement afterwards that the challenges were down to “the complexity and difficulty of Myanmar’s decades-long protracted conflicts, which has been further exacerbated by the current political crisis.”
But observers have low expectations for a tougher line, at least while Cambodia chairs the bloc, and are already looking to next year when Indonesia assumes leadership in 2023.
Addressing the “ongoing crisis” will be a focus for Biden in talks with Southeast Asian leaders as he attends ASEAN summits over the weekend, the White House said on Tuesday. Since the coup, the Biden administration has launched targeted sanctions against the military regime and held meetings with the opposition National Unity Government.
China, on the other hand, has shown support to the ruling military junta and would be unlikely to back tough action, observers say. A months-long inquiry into the situation in Myanmar released by an international team of lawmakers last month accused Russia and China of “supplying both weapons and legitimacy to an otherwise isolated regime.”
That, too, could have an impact on outcomes this weekend, according to political scientist Chong Ja Ian, an associate professor at the National University of Singapore.
“Because of Russian and (Chinese) support for the junta, any efforts toward a solution by ASEAN would require some form of engagement with them, whether this is to get buy-in or even just non-opposition,” Chong said.
The crisis in Myanmar is not the only area where US and China division may loom over the ASEAN summits, even as issues like China’s aggression in the South China Sea – where Beijing asserts territorial claims that conflict with those of several Southeast Asian countries – may be of lesser importance this year.
ASEAN will hold its usual side summits with both the US and China respectively, as well as other countries, and China’s number two leader, the economy-focused Premier Li Keqiang arrived earlier this week as Xi’s representative.
As Southeast Asian leaders seek to shore up their economic stability, they are likely to raise concerns about the impact of US-China competition on the region, its trade and supply chains, for example in the wake of a US export ban on semi-conductors to China, according to Chong.
“ASEAN states are going to try and find some way to navigate all this, and will be looking to both Beijing and Washington to see what sort of leeway they can provide,” he said.

Divers uncover a surprising discovery near the wreck of the Titanic

 — 
The wreck of the Titanic sits in two parts at the bottom of the North Atlantic Ocean, slowly decaying nearly 4,000 meters (13,000 feet) below the surface, but it’s not alone. A sonar blip detected around 26 years ago has now revealed there’s much more to this underwater area than previously thought.
P.H. Nargeolet, a veteran Nautile submersible pilot and Titanic diver, originally picked up the blip on echo sounding equipment in 1996, but its origins have remained unknown.

In an expedition to the Titanic shipwreck earlier this year, Nargeolet and four other researchers went to the blip’s previously recorded location to search for the mysterious object it represented. Due to the blip’s magnitude, Nargeolet had believed he was looking for another shipwreck — he instead found a rocky reef, made up of various volcanic formations, and thriving with lobsters, deep-sea fish, sponges and several species of coral that could be thousands of years old.
“It is biologically fascinating. The animals that live there are very different to the animals that are found otherwise living in the abyssal ocean,” said Murray Roberts, a professor of applied marine biology and ecology at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland and one of the researchers on the expedition. “(Nargeolet) did a really important piece of scientific work. He thought it was a shipwreck, and it turned out, in my mind, even more amazing than a shipwreck.”
Spooky spots to explore from the US to Asia
The abyssal plain is a term used to describe the ocean floor at a water depth of 3,000 to 4,000 meters (around 12,000 feet), which makes up 60% of Earth’s surface, according to Roberts. It is thought to be a featureless, muddy seabed without much structure. On a few occasions, divers have observed rocky formations on the plain. Since the recent discovery near the Titanic, Roberts now believes such features might be more common than previously thought.
Rocky areas may also help explain the distances that sponges and corals travel across the ocean floor, which has always been a mystery to scientists. Within the muddy environment where they are typically observed, there are few hard surfaces for these species to latch onto in order to grow and reproduce.

“Sometimes they turn up in places where we think, ‘Well, how did they get there? They don’t live long enough to get there,” Roberts said. “But if there are more of these rocky places, these stepping stones, than we ever thought, I think it could help us understand the distribution of these species across the ocean.”

The researchers are currently working on analyzing images and videos taken of the reef during their dive, and they intend to share their findings to improve the scientific community’s collective knowledge of deep-sea life. Roberts also hopes to link this discovery to a wider Atlantic Ocean ecosystem project he leads, called iAtlantic, that will allow for further study and protection of the fragile ecosystem within the reef.

China is building an 'Unsinkable Titanic'
There is another sonar blip near the Titanic that Nargeolet is hoping to identify on a future expedition. It was recorded in the same survey he performed years ago, in between the wreck of the Titanic and the newly uncovered reef — now named the Nargeolet-Fanning Ridge after him and the 2022 expedition’s mission specialist Oisín Fanning. Nargeolet expects whatever it is to be even bigger than this reef.
OceanGate Expeditions and their foundation — which, along with Fanning, provided the financial support for Nargeolet’s dive this year — will continue its longitudinal research work of the Titanic and surrounding areas in 2023.
“The marine life … was so beautiful. It was really unbelievable, because I was never expecting to see that in my life,” Nargeolet said. “I’ll be very happy to continue to look at the Titanic.”

My son has been asking for a dress. I finally decided to just get him dresses despite being afraid he’d get teased by other kids. Today, the boy next door asked why he was wearing a dress, I said “he wanted one” and he said “okay” then they continued to play. The kids are alright

Veterans and scientists fulfill ‘no man left behind,’ returning long-lost American remains from lonely Pacific WWII battlefield

 — 
On a remote Pacific sandbar, replete with the ravages of war, a small group of veterans, volunteers and archeologists are doing their best to keep the enduring promise of “no man left behind.”
According to the Department of Defense, nearly half of the known American casualties from the Battle of Tarawa were never recovered. Approximately 1,000 Marines and sailors lost their lives on the small sandbar November 20-23, 1943, in the US military’s first offensive of the war in the central Pacific.
The graves of more than 30 Marines and sailors killed in bloody World War II battle have been found
Graves remained lost for decades, Pentagon historians write, because of bad record keeping, poor memories, and in some instances, war infrastructure inadvertently built over service members’ unmarked final resting places. DOD records show by 1950, a military board declared hundreds of Americans who fought and died on the island “non-recoverable,” leaving families without words, images or ideas of where the young men rested.
After excavation efforts paused during the pandemic, teams will return to the lonely atoll, with the goal of returning as many remains of US service members as they can.
A WWII history buff, vets, and archeologists find lost 1943 graves
“This is not a normal thing for somebody to be doing,” said Paul Schwimmer, a retired US Army Green Beret who searches for American remains with the non-profit group, History Flight, who added a new chapter of history is unfolding along the isolated and idyllic shore.
“Don’t tell us these men are not recoverable, give us a chance to go after them.”
Government figures show 72,627 Americans are currently classified as missing in action from World War II. There are more US troops missing from 1941-1945, than from all other wars with US involvement combined.
In 2003, commercial pilot and World War II history aficionado Mark Noah founded History Flight. The group’s initial aim was to preserve American aviation history, an outgrowth of Noah’s love of antiquity, aircraft and his family tradition of scholarship.
An American family finds closure as a WWII hero finally comes home
“My father was a diplomat for the State Department, a Harvard and MIT-trained sinologist,” Noah said in an interview with CNN. “I was born in China, where my dad was posted, and I was able to see the lingering effects of World War II up close. That was the beginning of a fascination with the Second World War.”
Noah relates the multitude of missing service members to those missing in his own life.
“Four of my close friends in Beijing disappeared during Tiananmen Square,” Noah said. “And I’ve always wondered where they fell into, this deep void, the unknown. And at a subconscious level, it’s one of the reasons why I’m driven to find our missing Americans, especially when we know where they are, on an island.”
Noah said 2008 was a turning point, when History Flight’s mission changed from aviation to recovery missions.

“I was doing research about a missing airplane that crashed in the lagoon of Tarawa, and I was shocked at just how many people were missing on this small island,” Noah said.
“So, I self-funded what became our first Tarawa excavation, and with all of those people missing in such a small place, we chose Tarawa because we thought we could deliver a project with a high probability of success.” The cost was $25,000, with a team of 10 people.
A cadre of veterans, scientists and students interviewed residents who found bones underneath their homes. The non-profit also used ground-penetrating radar on the atoll, ultimately finding scores of American graves buried within a working commercial seaport.
In the decade since its first dig, History Flight has led to the identification of 96 American service members killed on Tarawa, according to the branch of the Pentagon charged with finding US military remains, the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency.
“That number undoubtedly will go up,” agency spokesperson Johnie Webb said.

In a cozy East Wenatchee, Washington, living room, twins Don and David McCannel held the crumbling and corroded helmet buried with their uncle, Gunnery Sgt. Arthur B. Summers, a Tarawa Marine once considered missing in action.
Summers’ near-complete skeleton is among the latest remains discovered by History Flight. His return home for burial in America followed a now familiar ritual of repatriation: Delicately-handled bones are discovered on Tarawa, then flown to the US for positive identification, and finally, re-buried with full military honors.
The McCannel twins are now 76 years old, born three years after a telegram told their mother Summers was killed in action, his body missing on a faraway Pacific island.
“My most vivid memory is, when I was about 10 years old, my mother said to me, ‘my brother was killed in Tarawa and his body was never recovered,’” David McCannel described in an interview. “She didn’t cry. She just said he’s gone forever.”
10 ways to honor veterans beyond Veterans Day
Schwimmer, the retired Green Beret with History Flight, said he was within the Tarawa excavation site when Summers’ remains were discovered in 2019, and attended Summers’ Washington funeral in August 2022.
“To see this, to look over my shoulder, to put my hand on the casket and say, ‘Hey bud, I saw you in 2019. I took you from Tarawa to here.’ For me, that’s great,” Schwimmer said. “Now, put me back on an airplane, get me in the field, I got work to do.”
Summers was killed on November 23, 1943, the final day of fighting on the island, and according to military records, the day Summers’ second enlistment extension was to expire.
“I thank them eternally, and forever,” Don McCannel said of History Flight and those responsible for Summers’ identification. “My uncle Arthur did his duty, and these men and women today did theirs, truly.”

No margin for error
The Pentagon agency tasked with finding the remains of an astounding 81,500 Americans missing since World War I, contracts Tarawa excavation work with History Flight. But the agency itself is solely responsible for the process of DNA identification.
There is no margin for error. Scientists and military personnel from Hawaii, Nebraska and Delaware finish the process of uniting stories, names, and family histories with the skeletal remains of US troops.

Dr. John Byrd, the agency’s laboratory director, explained the challenges of dealing with DNA from that era. “They’re highly degraded, there’s only a tiny amount of DNA left in there at all. And our DNA lab is the best in the world at extracting what little bit is left in there.”
Byrd said the average time to identify an individual is 2.5 years, but can be as quickly as two weeks.
“When none of the stars are aligned, it can take several years. We have ID’s we’ve made after more than 10 years, when we finally got enough evidence together to be able to prove the identity.”
For Summers’ remains, delivered to the agency’s Pearl Harbor laboratory in July 2019, the DOD agency was able to make a positive DNA identification in a matter of months, on October 17, 2019.
The identification process explained
First, remains arrive at an agency laboratory in Honolulu, or Omaha, Nebraska. “They come from a variety of sources, from our own excavations, and from excavations from our partners … We also do a lot of disinterments of unknown remains, right from our national cemeteries,” Byrd explained.
Next, as the remains are assigned to evidence managers, scientists determine which tests are needed to identify the remains. The majority will involve DNA testing, but other methods, such as dental records, can be used.

DNA testing and other identification work then begins. Samples are sent to the Armed Forces DNA Identification Lab in Dover, Delaware, and a type of identification known as stable isotope analysis can also be performed at the agency’s Pearl Harbor lab. The isotope testing is used to trace remains’ geographic origin.
Finally, test results are evaluated, and perhaps even more testing is needed.
“You love it when the test results come back in, and they clearly direct you to one individual that these remains should be,” Byrd said. “But we also sometimes get results that aren’t strong enough to point to one person only. And then we have to find another way to try to resolve the case other than the testing we did in the first round … that is one of the most difficult steps for many of our cases.”
Work is still to be done
History Flight estimates their Tarawa excavation efforts are halfway finished.
“We believe about 250 sets of remains can still be found, and we want to keep going,” History Flight founder Mark Noah said.
Get it straight: The difference between Memorial Day and Veterans Day
The non-profit’s vice president, retired U.S. Marine Corps Sgt. Maj. Justin LeHew, is currently walking across America, from Boston to Newport, Oregon, to donations for the group’s ongoing work in the Pacific.
LeHew served in the 2nd Marine Division, the same (albeit modern day) combat element which engaged in the Battle of Tarawa in November 1943. His previous chapter of military service includes receiving the Navy Cross, awarded for his 2003 role in rescuing ambushed soldiers in Iraq, including Pfc. Jessica Lynch.
“Team members are putting in the work for the missing,” LeHew wrote on Facebook, as his walk on U.S. Highway 20, America’s longest road, approached Yellowstone National Park.
“This specific road was selected to highlight the long journey home that over 81,000 missing U.S. Servicemembers have been trying to make since World War II,” LeHew said.
“We know that we can fulfill this promise of ‘no one left behind’ on Tarawa,” Noah added. “We simply need people to know we’re there, to know about us, put the financial resources in place, and help us carry on this sacred mission.”

Police inspector being investigated over Seoul’s Halloween crush found dead

 — 
A senior South Korean police inspector who was being investigated in connection with the deadly Halloween crowd crush in Seoul has been found dead in his home.
The inspector was found lifeless by his family at around 12:45pm on Friday, according to South Korean police.
The police said they are investigating the circumstances.
The news comes after investigators raided the offices of the Yongsan district police station, which oversees the nightlife neighborhood of Itaewon, where the crush took place.
In what was one of the country’s worst disasters, 158 people died after tens of thousands of costumed partygoers celebrating Halloween poured into the popular nightlife district, many of them becoming trapped as the narrow streets clogged up.
Public anger over the disaster has mounted since it emerged that hours before the tragedy members of the public had phoned the police to warn of overcrowding problems.
Korean authorities have also come under fire after witnesses said there were little to no crowd control measures in place in Itaewon on the night of the crush – despite police receiving warnings far in advance.
Last week, the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency said investigators raided eight of its offices and seized documents relating to reports made by members of the public to the 112 emergency hotline.
The raids were carried out by a special investigative unit created by the National Police Agency (NPA) to look into the disaster. The NPA said last week it had suspended the chief of the Yongsan police station, one of the police stations closest to the crush site.
Records given to CNN by the NPA show police received at least 11 calls from people in Itaewon concerned about the possibility of a crowd crush as early as four hours before the incident occurred.
The first call came at 6:34 p.m., when a caller warned, “It looks really dangerous … I fear people might get crushed.”
Another caller less than two hours later said there were so many people packed into Itaewon’s narrow alleys that they kept falling over and getting hurt.
Speaking to the media last week, NPA chief Yoon Hee-keun admitted for the first time that police had made mistakes in their response.
He added that the police response to the emergency calls had been “inadequate,” and that he felt a “heavy responsibility” as the agency head.
This story has been updated with the latest death toll in the disaster.

Ground stop at Dallas-Fort Worth airport lifted, FAA says
Pete Muntean, CNN • Updated 11th November 2022
Facebook
Twitter
Email
(CNN) — A ground stop at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport caused by a fuel fire Friday morning has been lifted. Hundreds of flights to and from the airport have been delayed.
The Federal Aviation Administration told CNN the ground stop was lifted as of 12:22 p.m. local time (1:22 p.m. ET).
The nationwide ground stop was implemented while safety inspections of fuel lines took place, preventing arriving aircraft from getting fuel, an FAA spokesman said Friday.
By early afternoon Friday, flight tracking site FlightAware showed more than 600 delays for flights originating from or bound for DFW.
The airport is one of the busiest in the United States and one of largest hubs for American Airlines.
American spokesman Curtis Blessing told CNN midday Friday that fuel was flowing and the airline was ""in recovery mode now."" Blessing said flight delays were the main issue, along with ""a handful"" of flight diversions.
DFW Airport tweeted Friday morning that the fire was extinguished and the affected pump was shut off. The ground stop was in effect while safety inspections were performed.
The airport tweeted an update after the ground stop was lifted: ""The airlines' fuel contractor has restored operations at their facility, and they are in the process of sending fuel to aircraft.""
The airport said getting fueling operations back to normal would take some time and encouraged travelers to check with airlines for flight status updates.

Ukrainians celebrate liberation as Russia pulls out of Kherson 02:34
November 11, 2022 Russia-Ukraine news
By Amy Woodyatt, Kathleen Magramo, Andrew Raine, Adrienne Vogt and Matt Meyer, CNN
Updated 8:00 p.m. ET, November 11, 2022
What we covered here
Russian forces have withdrawn from Ukraine’s Kherson region west of the Dnipro River, the Russian Defense Ministry said on Friday, in one of the biggest setbacks for Moscow since the start of the war.
Ukrainian troops have entered Kherson city, the regional capital, and residents have flooded the central square, waving Ukrainian flags, according to social media images geolocated by CNN. The main bridge across the Dnipro River has also been destroyed.
Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov has insisted that the Kherson region — one of four Ukrainian regions that Moscow claims to have annexed — remains part of Russia, denying that the retreat is ""humiliating"" for President Vladimir Putin.
Ukraine has made significant gains but President Volodymyr Zelensky cautioned that forces will advance carefully, amid warnings that Russian troops have mined the city and will continue to strike against it from the river's east bank.

Ukrainian forces moving forward in some parts of Luhansk region, local official says
From CNN's Julia Kesaieva
Two Ukrainian soldiers wait for evacuation at a medical point in the area of Svatove and Kreminna, Luhansk region, on November 4.
Fierce fighting continues in the Luhansk region of eastern Ukraine, where there are high numbers of newly mobilized Russian troops, according to a Ukrainian official.
Roman Vlasenko, head of Severodonetsk district military administration, told Ukrainian television that there were three major frontlines running north-south in Luhansk.
Vlasenko said that Ukrainian forces were making some progress around the town of Svatove, and further north.
He said that ""active hostilities"" are ongoing along the entire frontline in the Luhansk region.
Ukrainian forces were advancing west and south of Svatove and Russian ammunition depots were being destroyed, he said.
There was a high concentration of new Russian troops in the towns of Kreminna, Rubizhne, Severodonetsk and Lysychansk, Vlasenko said.
All four towns and cities are south of Svatove and were captured by the Russians in the spring and summer after intense conflict and widespread destruction.
Ukrainian forces are now within a few miles of all four places, he said.

Biden administration divided over path ahead for Ukraine as top US general pushes for diplomacy
From CNN's Kylie Atwood and Oren Liebermann
During internal conversations about the war in Ukraine, America's top general, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley, has in recent weeks led a strong push to seek a diplomatic solution as fighting heads toward a winter lull. 
But Milley's position is not widely backed by President Biden's national security team, including Secretary of State Tony Blinken and National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, neither of whom believe it's time to make a serious push for talks over Ukraine, according to two administration officials familiar with the discussion.
The result is a growing debate inside the administration over whether Ukraine's recent gains on the battlefield should spark a renewed effort to seek some sort of negotiated end to the fighting, according to officials. 
Milley's push for peace has spilled into the public in recent days, just as Ukraine takes back the city of Kherson. In comments at the Economic Club of New York on Wednesday, Milley praised the Ukrainian army for fighting Russia to a stalemate, but said that an outright military victory is out of reach. 
""When there's an opportunity to negotiate, when peace can be achieved, seize it. Seize the moment,"" Milley said.
The comments left administration officials unsurprised — given Milley's advocacy for the position internally — but also raised concern among some about the administration appearing divided in the eyes of the Kremlin. 
While some Biden officials are more open to exploring what diplomacy may look like, sources tell CNN most of the top diplomatic and national security officials are wary of giving Russian President Vladimir Putin any sort of leverage at the negotiating table and believe Ukrainians must determine when to hold talks, not the US. 
""That's up to the Ukrainians. Nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine,"" President Biden said at a Wednesday press conference when asked about the potential for talks. 
In internal deliberations, officials say Milley has sought to make it clear that he is not urging a Ukrainian capitulation, but rather that he believes now is an optimal time to drive toward an end to the war before it drags into spring or beyond, leading to more death and destruction without changing the front lines, officials say. 
Milley's position comes as the US military has dug deep into US weapons stockpiles to support the Ukrainians and is currently scouring the globe for materials to support Ukraine heading into winter — such as heaters and generators — which has raised concerns about how long this war can be sustained, officials said.

Ukrainian authorities are beginning the hard work of rebuilding in territories recently liberated in their southern counteroffensive.
The head of the regional military administration of Mykolaiv, which neighbors Kherson, visited the small city of Snihurivka Friday to discuss ""the restoration of life in the liberated territories of the region.""
""We are already working on providing the liberated communities with electricity and communication and restoring the TV signal. Tomorrow we expect to replenish warehouses with humanitarian aid for the population,"" the leader, Vitalii Kim, said.
He commended hospital staff in the city for working through the Russian occupation.
He also urged locals to beware of any explosives left behind by the Russians.
""Despite the fact that the relevant services have already started (removing mines in) the liberated territories, I warn local residents to be careful,"" Kim added.

At least 7 Kherson bridges destroyed in last 24 hours, satellite images and photos show
From CNN's Paul P. Murphy, Tim Lister and Gianluca Mezzofiore

At least seven bridges — four of them crossing the Dnipro River — have been destroyed in the last 24 hours, according to satellite images from Maxar Technologies and other photos.
Two bridges, a vehicle and a railroad bridge that sit atop a dam at Nova Kakhovka were among those destroyed. 
In recent months, Ukrainian strikes on and near the bridge had badly damaged the Antonivskyi vehicle bridge, located just southeast of the city of Kherson, but the latest damage completely destroyed a number of roadway sections. Additionally, the Antonivskyi railroad bridge, located just east of the vehicle bridge, was also ruined. 
Another bridge, which crosses the Inhulets River at Darivka, was also destroyed. 
Finally, two bridges — a highway and a pedestrian bridge — were wrecked in the village of Tyahinka. That village is located just 14 miles east of the dam at Nova Kakhovka. 
It's unclear who is responsible for the destruction of the bridges, but they come as Russian military forces retreated from the west bank of the Dnipro in the Kherson region.

Zelensky: Ukrainian special units are in Kherson city, with more military and government services on the way
From CNN's Tim Lister and Julia Kesaieva
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Friday has been ""a historic day"" for Ukraine after Russia announced its withdrawal from the west bank of the Kherson region.
""We are returning the south of our country, we are returning Kherson,"" Zelensky said.
""As of now, our defenders are on the outskirts of the city. Just a little more to go and we will enter. But special units are already in the city,"" he added.
The president talked about the appearance of Ukrainian flags in the city even before the military arrived, saying, ""I am happy to see how people, despite all the threats, despite the repressions, abuse of the occupiers, kept Ukrainian flags, believed in Ukraine.""
Zelensky expressed his gratitude to the military units involved in the operation — ""absolutely everyone, from privates to generals, the Armed Forces, intelligence, the Security Service of Ukraine, the National Guard — all those who brought this day closer for Kherson region.""
He said stabilization measures would follow due to the threat of mines. ""The occupiers left a lot of mines and explosives, in particular at vital facilities. We will be clearing them,"" he said.
""Our defenders are followed by police, sappers, rescuers, power engineers ... Medicine, communications, social services are returning. ... Life is returning,"" he said.
Zelensky repeated what Ukraine's Intelligence Directorate said earlier Friday, appealing to any Russian soldiers still on the west bank to surrender.
""We guarantee that you will be treated in accordance with the law and international standards. And to those Russian military who disguised themselves in civilian clothes and are hiding somewhere, I want to say that you cannot hide. We will find you anyway. Do not delay.""
1:29 p.m. ET, November 11, 2022
Ukrainian officials urge people not to return to homes in liberated areas of Kherson
From CNN's Tim Lister and Julia Kesaieva
As Ukrainian forces consolidate their hold on the western part of the Kherson region, officials have warned residents not to try to return home too soon.
""More and more settlements are returning under the Ukrainian flag,"" the head of Kherson's regional military administration, Yaroslav Yanushevych, said in a video.
""I understand that everyone is homesick and are eager to return home as soon as possible,"" he continued, saying, ""I am asking you to wait a little. It’s too dangerous here now. There is a high probability that the enemy will shell the newly de-occupied settlements. Beyond that, the area should be examined by explosive experts. Unfortunately, there are already many civilian casualties caused by explosive devices.""
Ukrainian officials have also been posting video of Russian armor left behind, despite the insistence of the Russian Defense Ministry that all equipment had been taken to the east bank.
Ukrainian Infrastructure minister Oleksandr Kubrakov said plans were underway to restore transportation connections with the liberated territories of Kherson.
The General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine said that ""in the course of successful offensive actions, advanced units of our troops in some places have already reached the right bank of the Dnipro river. Measures to detect and eliminate the enemy in a number of settlements continue.""
In its operational note late Friday, the General Staff said that Russian forces were ""improving the fortification equipment of defensive borders on the left [east] bank of the Dnipro"" and in Crimea.
Elsewhere on the front lines The military said that , Russian forces continued offensive actions in parts of Donetsk, including in Bakhmut, Avdiivka and Novopavlivka.
It claimed that Ukrainian fire had inflicted heavy casualties on a Russian control point near the city of Enerhodar, which is next to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant. ""More than 50 occupiers were killed and more than 40 were wounded,"" it said.

New damage caused to critical dam in Kherson, satellite images show
From CNN's Paul P. Murphy, Gianluca Mezzofiore, Julia Kesaieva and Tim Lister

New damage has been inflicted on a critical dam that spans the Dnipro River at Nova Kakhovka in the Kherson region in the last 24 hours, according to satellite images from Maxar Technologies obtained by CNN.
Water is flowing out of three sluice gates at the dam, where a major hydro-electric project is situated. 
It's unclear how the latest damage, which is close to the west bank, was caused. Local Telegram channels reported Thursday night the sound of explosions around the dam.
The sluice gates under the destroyed sections of the bridge are the only ones releasing water, but it's unclear from the satellite images whether they were damaged in the explosion and whether the release of water is controlled or impeded by the collapsed sections of bridge.
A photo, which appeared on social media on Friday afternoon, showed water flowing from the corners of the sluice gates and the missing bridge sections. CNN geolocated and confirmed the authenticity of the photo, which was taken from the southern bank of the Dnipro River.
Although Ukrainian armed forces have liberated large swathes of territory in Kherson, they do not appear they have taken control of the dam at Nova Kakhovka.
Ukrhydroenergo, which operates the hydro-electric plant, said it had not heard of fresh damage to the dam and was unable to offer further comment.
The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant upstream uses the water in the dam's reservoir to cool its nuclear reactors. The reservoir holds about 18 million cubic meters of water.
On Oct. 21, Ukrainian Defense Intelligence claimed that Russian forces had begun mining the sluice gates and supports at the dam. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky also made similar claims in a national speech on Oct. 20. 
At the time, Russian-appointed officials in Kherson dismissed the claims as ""nonsense.""

Ukraine acknowledges for first time that it carried out attack on Russian ships in Sevastopol
From Victoria Butenko
Ukraine has acknowledged that its forces carried out attacks on the Russian fleet and harbor at Sevastopol in Crimea at the end of last month.
A government crowdfunding platform said that ""on October 29, 2022, naval drones hit Russian ships, [in an operation] carried out exclusively by unmanned devices.""
The platform said that ""small and fast"" drones had damaged three Russian vessels, including the Admiral Makarov, a frigate warship that is also the flagship of the Russian Black Sea Fleet.
Russian authorities acknowledged damage to a minesweeper but not to any other naval vessel. There has been no independent confirmation that the Makarov was seriously damaged.
The crowdfunding site said its goal was ""to assemble a fleet of 100 such vessels. They will defend the waters of our seas, stop Russian ships carrying missiles from leaving the bay, protect merchant ships, and perform secret missions.""
It estimated the cost of each naval drone at $250,000.

So how can this country remain on the UN Security Council? I get that it could worsen things in some ways with Russia, but having them there with a veto after doing all this mocks the legitimacy of the UN, too.

Donald Trump believes we should terminate “all rules, regulations and articles, even those found in the Constitution” to overturn the 2020 election. That was his view on 1/6 and remains his view today. No honest person can now deny that Trump is an enemy of the Constitution.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez says she feels in danger in current political environment
By Paul LeBlanc, CNN
Published 6:00 AM EST, Fri November 11, 2022

CNN
 — 
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said that she “absolutely” has felt her life is in danger since joining Congress, with her head always “on a swivel” when she’s in public amid the nation’s charged political environment.
“It is a very real dynamic and very unfortunately and tragically we’ve seen political violence play out,” the New York Democrat told CNN’s Chris Wallace on “Who’s Talking to Chris Wallace?”
The New York Democrat said the deluge of threats against her means “when I wake up in the morning, I hesitate to walk my dog. It means when I come home, I have to ask my fiancé to come out to where my car is to walk me just from my car to my front door.”
“It means that there’s just – a general disposition where you kind of feel like there’s almost a static electricity around you,” she said.

The recent attack on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s husband has touched off fresh concern about violence against lawmakers and their families. Federal law enforcement agencies have consistently warned about the increasing threat of politically motivated violence after January 6, 2021, raising specific concerns about the likelihood that online calls for violence result in real-world attacks.
Ocasio-Cortez’s progressive credentials have made her the ire of many congressional Republicans and their supporters. She told The New York Times this fall that her office struggles to keep up with “astronomical” amount of threats she receives each day.
Such an environment, Ocasio-Cortez told CNN, has influenced her approach to her work, pushing her to be “as robust and urgent as possible.”
“I don’t want to take the time I have for granted. I don’t know if I’m going to be there to see us achieve guaranteed health care in the United States. So I need to advocate it in a very fully throated way right now,” she said.
“Similar to a full path to citizenship for millions of people in this country. I just have to be out and say it and at least leave a roadmap should I not be there.”
Asked about the future of Democratic leadership in Congress, Ocasio-Cortez, speaking broadly, said, “I do believe we need to have not just generational shifts, but potentially substantive shifts as well.”
“I think that and I hope that what we’ve seen, whether people think it’s too left or too right, or up or down or whatever, it may be that we shift in a direction where the leadership of the Democratic Party is less reliant on large and corporate donors and sponsorship, because that does have a shaping effect of our legislative priorities,” she said.

What student loan borrowers need to know as Biden’s forgiveness program is stuck in legal limbo

 — 
Student loan borrowers are now waiting indefinitely to see if they’ll receive debt relief under President Joe Biden’s student loan forgiveness program while several legal challenges play out across the country.
In the latest legal action, the Department of Justice asked the Supreme Court Friday to allow the program to go into effect in the meantime, noting the impact on “economically vulnerable borrowers.”
It could take weeks, if not months, for the legal issues to be resolved.
A federal judge in Texas struck down the program nationwide on November 10, declaring it illegal, in the most significant legal setback thus far for Biden’s student loan forgiveness program – prompting the Department of Education to stop accepting applications for debt relief.
Biden’s program was already on hold at the time due to a separate legal challenge before the 8th US Circuit Court of Appeals, but the administration had continued accepting applications, having received 26 million to date.
Under the rules of the student loan forgiveness program, eligible low- and middle-income borrowers can receive up to $10,000 of federal student loan forgiveness and up to $20,000 in cancellation if they also received a Pell grant while enrolled in college.
What happens now for borrowers?
Borrowers will have to wait for the lawsuits to play out. While it can be tough to follow all the various legal challenges, borrowers can subscribe for updates from the Department of Education and check the Federal Student Aid website for further information.
Initially, the Biden administration said that it would start granting student loan forgiveness before payments are set to resume in January after a yearslong pandemic pause.
But that timeline is now in jeopardy.
“For the 26 million borrowers who have already given the Department of Education the necessary information to be considered for debt relief – 16 million of whom have already been approved for relief – the Department will hold onto their information so it can quickly process their relief once we prevail in court,” said White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre in a statement following the Texas ruling that struck down the program.
“We strongly disagree with the District Court’s ruling on our student debt relief program,” she said.
The Department of Justice immediately appealed the Texas judge’s ruling to the 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals.
Four days after the Texas decision, the 8th US Circuit Court of Appeals dealt another legal blow to Biden’s program, granting a request for a preliminary injunction sought by six GOP-led states in a separate lawsuit. The ruling did not change the status quo since the program was already struck down.
The government has asked the Supreme Court to block the 8th Circuit Court’s injunction.
What are the legal arguments?
The Biden administration has argued that Congress granted the secretary of education the power to broadly discharge student loan debt in a 2003 law known as the HEROES Act, which was passed in the wake of the September 11 terrorist attacks.
The government’s lawyers argue that the law allows the secretary to discharge debt in an event of a national emergency, including the Covid-19 pandemic.
But the Texas federal judge found that the law does not provide the executive branch clear congressional authorization to create the student loan forgiveness program.
“The program is thus an unconstitutional exercise of Congress’s legislative power and must be vacated,” wrote Judge Mark Pittman, who was nominated by then-President Donald Trump.
“In this country, we are not ruled by an all-powerful executive with a pen and a phone,” he continued.
The Texas lawsuit was filed by a conservative group, the Job Creators Network Foundation, in October on behalf of two borrowers who did not qualify for debt relief.
One plaintiff did not qualify for the student loan forgiveness program because her loans are not held by the federal government and the other plaintiff is only eligible for $10,000 in debt relief because he did not receive a Pell grant.
They argued that they could not voice their disagreement with the program’s rules because the administration did not put it through a formal notice-and-comment rule making process under the Administrative Procedure Act.
“This ruling protects the rule of law which requires all Americans to have their voices heard by their federal government,” said Elaine Parker, president of Job Creators Network Foundation, in a statement following the ruling on November 10.
The advocacy group was founded by Bernie Marcus, a major Trump donor and former Home Depot CEO.
Where do the other lawsuits stand?
Beyond the Texas case, the Biden administration is facing several other lawsuits over the student loan forgiveness program.
A lawsuit brought by six Republican-led states is pending at the 8th US Circuit Court of Appeals. On October 21, that appeals court put an administrative hold on the program, banning the administration from canceling any debt. The appeals court then granted a preliminary injunction request from the states on November 14. The injunction will “remain in effect until further order of this court or the Supreme Court of the United States,” according to the order. The Department of Justice has asked the Supreme Court to vacate the injunction.
The states have argued that the Biden administration does not have the legal authority to grant broad student loan forgiveness, as well as that the program would hurt them financially for a variety of reasons. A lower court had dismissed the case, ruling that the states did not have legal standing to sue. The states immediately appealed to the 8th Circuit.
The Biden administration has had several wins in court thus far, as plaintiffs have struggled to show they have standing to sue.
One lawsuit, filed by a Wisconsin taxpayers group, was also dismissed by a trial-level federal judge, ruling that the group lacked standing to bring the challenge. The plaintiffs had argued that the loan forgiveness program, which is estimated to cost about $400 billion, would hurt taxpayers and the US Treasury. Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett also rejected the taxpayers group’s request for the Supreme Court to intervene.
A separate case, which was also rejected by Barrett and dismissed by a lower court, was filed by a borrower who argued that the forthcoming loan forgiveness would leave him with a bigger state tax bill. Some states may tax the debt forgiveness, but it is not taxable on the federal level.
The Biden administration is also facing pending lawsuits from Arizona’s GOP Attorney General Mark Brnovich and the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank. Both lawsuits argue that the president does not have the legal authority to broadly cancel student loan debt.
Brnovich argues that the state has standing to sue because the student loan forgiveness program could reduce Arizona’s tax revenue. The state code doesn’t consider the loan forgiveness as taxable income.
The Arizona complaint also argues that the forgiveness policy will hurt the attorney general office’s ability to recruit employees. Currently, its employees may be eligible for the federal Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, but some potential job candidates may not view that as a benefit if their student loan debt is already canceled, the lawsuit argues.
The Cato Institute makes a similar argument about the forgiveness program making it harder for it to recruit employees.
Who may be eligible for student loan forgiveness?
If Biden’s program is allowed to move forward, individual borrowers who earned less than $125,000 in either 2020 or 2021 and married couples or heads of households who made less than $250,000 annually in those years could see up to $10,000 of their federal student loan debt forgiven.
If a qualifying borrower also received a federal Pell grant while enrolled in college, the individual is eligible for up to $20,000 of debt forgiveness.
There are a variety of federal student loans and not all are eligible for relief. Federal Direct Loans, including subsidized loans, unsubsidized loans, parent PLUS loans and graduate PLUS loans, are eligible.
But federal student loans that are guaranteed by the government but held by private lenders are not eligible unless the borrower applied to consolidate those loans into a Direct Loan before September 29.
This headline and story have been updated with additional information.

Gallagher, watermelon-smashing comedian, dead at 76
By Lisa Respers France, CNN
Updated 1:16 PM EST, Fri November 11, 2022
Comedian Gallagher, seen here performing at The Ice House Comedy Club on May 23, 2014 in Pasadena, California, has died, according to his manager.

 — 
Comedian Gallagher, best known for his watermelon-smashing comedy routine and many popular specials in the 1980s, died Friday morning, according his manager Craig Marquardo. He was 76.
According to a statement provided to CNN by Marquardo, the comedian died “after a short health battle” and “passed away surrounded by his family in Palm Springs, California.”
Gallagher, born Leo Gallagher, became a household name in the early ’80s with a comedy special titled “An Uncensored Evening,” the first comedy stand up special ever to air on cable television, according to an obituary shared by Marquardo.
Gallagher’s most famous bit involved a hand-made sledgehammer he called the “Sledge-O-Matic,” which he would use to smash food on stage, spraying the audience.
Comedian Gallagher circa 1970s.
Bill Johnson/Denver Post/Getty Images
“That was something else he liked to claim credit for, which was physically engaging the audience in that manner,” the obituary said.
Gallagher, a Fort Bragg, North Carolina native, earned a chemical engineering degree from the University of South Florida before moving to Los Angeles and developing his comedy act at legendary venue The Comedy Store, located on the Sunset Strip, according to his biography on the website for Selak Entertainment, a booking agency.
People began to take notice in 1975 when he performed his brand of prop comedy on Johnny Carson’s famed “The Tonight Show.”
TV was good to him and in 1978, he made an appearance on “The Mike Douglas Show” and the next year appeared on “The Merv Griffin Show.”
But it was his Showtime 1980s comedy specials that firmly cemented him in pop culture, and he would go on to do more than a dozen for the network over 27 years.
He was also an early staple of MTV and Comedy Central.
“While his counterparts went on to do sitcoms, host talk shows and star in movies, Gallagher stayed on the road touring America for decades,” the obituary said. “He was pretty sure he held a record for the most stand up dates, by attrition alone.”
Gallagher toured steadily until the Covid-19 pandemic hit and used the break to spend time with his son, Barnaby, and daughter Aimee, the latter of whom had appeared with him on his specials when she was a child.

Credit card rates hit a record high as Fed fights inflation

It’s never a great time to carry credit card debt. But right now is arguably the worst time.
The Federal Reserve’s war on inflation has driven up the average credit card APR (annual percentage rate) to 19.04% as of November 9, according to Bankrate.com.
That’s the highest rate since Bankrate.com’s database began in 1985, beating the prior record of 19% set in July 1991.
The milestone is the latest demonstration of how the Fed’s historic inflation-fighting campaign is pushing up borrowing costs on Main Street. Mortgage rates more than doubled over the past year to 20-year highs, forcing countless potential buyers to drop out of the housing market.
The national average APR for credit cards has climbed by 2.74 percentage points so far this year, the biggest increase in a single year on record, according to Bankrate.com.
The spike comes after credit card balances rose sharply earlier this year amid high inflation, according to Federal Reserve research. Industry experts predict shoppers will lean heavily on credit cards to pay for increasingly expensive gifts this holiday shopping season.
How long will it take to pay off my credit cards?
“It’s hard to build wealth when you are paying the credit card company this much every month,” said Ted Rossman, Bankrate’s senior industry analyst.
Credit card debt can be punishing, even at lower rates.
At the 16.3% national average rate at the start of the year, it would have taken 185 months of minimum payments to pay off $5,000 in credit card debt, according to Bankrate.com. And that would have cost $5,517 in interest. At the current rate, it will take 191 months and cost $6,546 in interest to pay off the same $5,000 credit card balance.
The good news is that despite high inflation, Americans are largely paying their credit card bills. Delinquencies and defaults are very low, in part due to savings many people accumulated during the Covid-19 pandemic.
The bad news is that could change quickly if projections for a spike in layoffs come true.
In the past few days alone, Facebook owner Meta has revealed it will slash more than 11,000 jobs, Lyft said it will cut 700 jobs and Redfin announced nearly 900 layoffs. Others including Amazon have said they will freeze some hiring.
“There is only one way for the unemployment rate to go: Up,” said Rossman.
Rossman recommends Americans struggling with credit card debt consider either taking out a low-rate personal loan or transferring their balance to a 0% balance transfer card.
Competition has heated up in this space and some 0% balance transfer cards allow consumers to avoid interest for up to 21 months, buying them time to pay down their balance, Rossman said.

Mortgage rates rise back above 7%

Mortgage rates have jumped back above 7%, after dropping last week.
The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 7.08% in the week ending November 10, up from 6.95% the week before, according to Freddie Mac. A year ago, the 30-year fixed rate stood at 2.98%.
Mortgage rates have risen throughout most of 2022, spurred by the Federal Reserve’s unprecedented campaign of hiking interest rates in order to tame soaring inflation.
What will my monthly mortgage payment be?
Last week, the Fed announced it would raise interest rates by another 75 basis points, the sixth rate increase this year and the fourth-consecutive hike of that size. While the Labor Department announced Thursday that consumer prices rose in October by 7.7% from a year ago, less than expected, the Fed still has far to go in its effort to tame inflation.
“The housing market is the most interest-rate sensitive segment of the economy, and the impact rates have on homebuyers continues to evolve,” said Sam Khater, Freddie Mac’s chief economist. “Home sales have declined significantly and, as we approach year-end, they are not expected to improve.”
While the Fed does not set the interest rates borrowers pay on mortgages directly, its actions influence them. Mortgage rates tend to track the yield on 10-year US Treasury bonds. As investors see or anticipate rate hikes, they make moves which send yields higher and mortgage rates rise.
Affordability is not improving
With mortgage rates up four percentage points from a year ago, buyers’ purchasing power has plummeted. That has pushed many buyers out of the market and those who remain may need to look at a lower price point or make compromises on the location, size, or condition of a house in order to find one that is affordable.
“The key to making a good decision in this challenging housing market is to be laser focused on what you need now and in the years ahead, so that you can stay in your home long enough that buying is a sound financial decision,” said Danielle Hale, Realtor.com’s chief economist.
Based on September 2021’s median home price and 30-year fixed mortgage rate, a typical homebuyer with a 20% down payment would have been looking at a $1,187 monthly payment last year, according to calculations from Freddie Mac.
This year, due to both higher prices and mortgage rates that are hovering around 7%, a typical buyer is facing a $2,065 monthly payment. That is $878 more a month.
Because of this drastic change in the cost to finance a home, sales have dropped for eight months running, according to the National Association of Realtors. A survey from Fannie Mae showed that only 16% of people think this is a good time to buy a home, a record low.
But last week’s mortgage applications ticked up slightly for the first time in six weeks, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association, indicating that some people are still buying homes.
“The desire for homeownership is strong,” said Bob Broeksmit, president and CEO of the MBA. “Many prospective buyers are waiting for the volatility in mortgage rates to subside, as well as for a clearer picture of the economic outlook.”
The average mortgage rate is based on a survey of conventional home purchase loans for borrowers who put 20% down and have excellent credit, according to Freddie Mac. But many buyers who put down less money up front or have less than perfect credit will pay more.

Eating disorders have risen in recent years. A new finding may help catch them earlier
By Madeline Holcombe, CNN
Updated 1:10 PM EST, Thu November 10, 2022
The study results suggested that electrolyte levels can help health care professionals identify who might benefit from eating disorder screening, experts said.

CNN
 — 
Health care professionals may now have a way to identify possible eating disorder cases a year before they would have been diagnosed, allowing patients to receive support much sooner, according to a new study.
Researchers analyzed provincial health data from Ontario, Canada, for people age 13 and older starting in 2008. The study team tracked participants’ electrolyte levels until 2020 and noted how many were diagnosed with eating disorders, according to the study published Tuesday in JAMA Network Open.
Hospitalizations for eating disorders grew in the pandemic. The problem isn't over, experts say
The results showed that people who experienced electrolyte abnormalities were twice as likely as those who didn’t to be diagnosed with an eating disorder — sometimes more than a year later. And people with severe abnormalities were more than five times as likely to be diagnosed, the study showed.
Abnormal electrolyte levels are common when a person is diagnosed with an eating disorder, said lead study author Dr. Gregory Hundemer, assistant professor of medicine at the University of Ottawa and a nephrologist at the Ottawa Hospital.
EATING DISORDER RESOURCES
US: National Eating Disorder Association
The NEDA has a confidential, toll free helpline at 800-931-2237 as well as an online click-to-chat service. For 24/7 crisis support, text “NEDA” to 741-741.
The NEDA also has a list of recommended websites and free or low-cost resources.
US: National Association of Anorexia Nervosa and Associated Disorders
ANAD runs a helpline at 888-375-7767 from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. CT and provides links to support groups and treatment providers.
Australia: National Eating Disorders Collaboration
A call center at 800-334-673 and online chat run by the Butterfly Foundation is open 8 a.m. to midnight AET every day except public holidays.
UK: Beat Eating Disorders
Helplines for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are open 9 a.m. to midnight weekdays and 4 p.m. to midnight weekends, every day of the year.
Electrolytes — important minerals such as potassium, phosphate and magnesium — can be thrown off by dehydration, restrictive diets, vomiting and use of laxatives, all of which may be symptomatic of an eating disorder, said Dr. Jason Nagata, assistant professor of pediatrics at the University of California, San Francisco. Nagata was not involved in this study.
Disordered eating patterns are often present well before a person is diagnosed, which is why the researchers hypothesized that electrolyte levels might be a good indicator of who might develop an eating disorder, Hundemer said.
“This study raised the concern that electrolyte abnormalities may be a red flag for more screening much earlier into the course of an eating disorder than we might think,” said Dr. Sydney Hartman-Munick, assistant professor of pediatrics at the University of Massachusetts Chan Medical School. Hartman-Munick was not involved in the study.
“We know that timely screening, diagnosis and treatment predict better prognosis for patients with eating disorders, and the study introduces the idea that electrolyte abnormalities may be a red flag that could lead to further evaluation, especially in the primary care setting,” Hartman-Munick added.
Early signs of eating disorders
Abnormal electrolyte levels can be life threatening, and eating disorders have risen since the pandemic started, Nagata said. From the spring of 2020 — when most Covid-19 restrictions/lockdowns were first put in place — through spring 2021, the number of eating disorder inpatient admissions in young adults and adolescents about doubled, according to a recent study.
This latest study on electrolyte abnormalities shows there is a potential for faster intervention, Hundemer said.

Many of the abnormalities were noted more than a year before diagnosis, and in that time, patients might be directed to more targeted screenings for eating disorders, he added.
“There is still so much we don’t know about the best methods for prevention and early detection for eating disorders, and this study offers new insight into future study in this area,” Hartman-Munick said.
Eating disorders are underrecognized and undertreated, especially among men, the LGBTQ community, people of color, older adults and those with larger bodies, Nagata said.
Health care providers should be aware of the risk that may come with abnormal electrolyte levels and the warning signs of an eating disorder — which include fasting, severe caloric restriction, vomiting, or using laxatives or diuretics to lose weight, he said.
'I couldn't stop.' The pandemic is triggering eating disorders in our children
If you are concerned about your weight loss behaviors — including vomiting, laxatives or diuretic use — you should talk with your health care provider about checking electrolyte levels, Nagata added.
Families of teens and adolescents who are showing signs of eating disorders should raise concerns with a health care provider, Nagata said. The professional can assess for an eating disorder and refer families to helpful resources, he added.
If you think someone you know might be struggling with an eating disorder, you can also call the National Eating Disorders Association helpline (800-931-2237) for guidance on how to provide support.

Is the worst over for bitcoin and the rest of crypto?

CNN reporter shows what consumer price growth means for inflation

New York
CNN
 — 
Stocks soared in their best day since 2020 on Thursday after new economic data showed that price increases eased in October. Investors cheered the development because it indicates the Federal Reserve’s interest rate hikes may finally be cooling inflation.
The Dow rose 1,203 points, or 3.7%. The S&P 500 was up 5.5% while the Nasdaq Composite was 7.3% higher. That marked the biggest point gain for the Dow and also the biggest percentage jumps for the S&P and Nasdaq since spring 2020.
Meanwhile, the 10-year Treasury yield tumbled below the threshold of 4%, to about 3.82%. The direction of the 10-year bond yield impacts mortgage rates as well as rates for several other types of consumer and business loans. And the 10-year itself is influenced by short-term interest rates set by the Fed.
Inflation cools much more than expected in October
The Consumer Price Index, a key inflation gauge, rose 7.7% for the year ending in October. Although that is still uncomfortably high, it is down from 8.2% in September and well below analyst estimates of 8%. It is also the smallest year-over-year increase for CPI since a 7.5% jump in January.
Wall Street is hoping that the data will help convince the Fed to pull back on the size and pace of its interest rate increases, which investors worry could send the economy into a recession. Fed funds futures are now pricing in about an 85% chance of a half-point increase, as opposed to three-quarters of a percentage point, at the central bank’s December 14 meeting.

My son has been asking for a dress. I finally decided to just get him dresses despite being afraid he’d get teased by other kids. Today, the boy next door asked why he was wearing a dress, I said “he wanted one” and he said “okay” then they continued to play. The kids are alright

 — 
Consumers were feeling slightly worse about the US economy in November, amid punishing rate hikes and decades-high inflation, according to a closely followed University of Michigan survey released Friday.
The preliminary index reading from the monthly Surveys of Consumers showed sentiment fell to 54.7, from 59.9 in October. Economists were expecting sentiment levels to tick down to 59.5, according to estimates on Refinitiv.
It’s the lowest reading since this summer when sentiment bottomed out after gas prices hit a record high in June.
The survey showed that sentiment slumped both for current economic conditions as well as for those in the near future.
Sustained high levels of inflation as well as rising interest rates are weighing on consumers, who are also expecting the currently robust labor market to weaken in the year ahead, Surveys of Consumers Director Joanne Hsu told Bloomberg in an interview following the report’s release.
“Consumers don’t think we’re out of the woods yet,” she said.
The survey also showed that consumers’ inflation expectations for this year and five years out remained relatively unchanged. This key data point for the Federal Reserve showed that the median expected year-ahead inflation rate was 5.1%, up from 5% last month. Long-run expectations were at 3%, holding in the same 2.9% to 3.1% range for 15 of the past 16 months, according to the data.
The Fed is closely watching for shifts in consumer expectations to determine if inflation is becoming entrenched in the United States: If consumers believe prices will remain high, that could factor in to increased wage demands which, in turn, could cause businesses to raise prices.
Very few consumers are front-loading purchases to avoid higher interest rates in the future, indicating that inflation expectations aren’t worsening, Hsu said.
“Consumers are not really showing strong signs of inflationary psychology or entrenched expectations,” she said during the interview.
The data for the surveys was collected prior to the midterm elections as well as Thursday’s better-than-expected Consumer Price Index, which showed inflation slowed to 7.7% in October, falling further than expected and sending stocks surging on the news.
“It’s possible that we could be at an inflection point, but we really have to see if these trends are going to be sustained,” Hsu said.
Final sentiment data for this month will be released Nov. 23.

Nick Cannon is set to welcome his 12th child

 — 
If Hollywood is looking for someone to cast in another version of “Cheaper by the Dozen,” Nick Cannon would now seem the natural lead.
The host of the show “The Masked Singer” continues to embrace fatherhood, this time with Abby De La Rosa, who has confirmed that she will welcome her third child with Cannon.
The pair are already parents to twins Zillion and Zion.
This baby news comes on the heels of model Alyssa Scott sharing – via maternity photos with Cannon – that she is also expecting. Scott and Cannon lost their five-month-old son Zen to brain cancer last year.
For those wanting to keep track, try to follow this bouncing (baby) ball: Cannon also shares 11-year-old twins, Monroe and Moroccan, with his ex-wife Mariah Carey and in July, he welcomed baby Legendary Love with Bre Tiesi.
Brittany Bell is mother to three of his children, Golden, 5, Powerful Queen, 1, and newborn Rise Messiah, who was born in September right around the time Cannon welcomed another baby, Onyx Ice Cole, with Lanisha Cole,
That same month, De La Rosa appeared on the “Lovers and Friends with Shan Boodram” podcast where she talked about her “open relationship” with Cannon, who she considers her “primary partner.”
She said that while Cannon is “very spread thin” when it comes to his paternal duties, he “does his best to be a present co-parent, a present parent, a present father.”
“I’m excited for my kids to grow up and be like, ‘Mom and dad, y’all did it your way and I love that,’” De La Rosa said. “And I hope my kids can eventually do it their way, whatever that may be in whatever capacity that is.”

Tunnel discovered beneath Egyptian temple may lead to Cleopatra's tomb, archaeologist says
Updated 10th November 2022

Written by
Christian Edwards, CNN
Kathleen Martinez, an archaeologist at the University of Santo Domingo, has been searching for the lost tomb of Cleopatra for nearly 20 years. Now she believes she's made a pivotal breakthrough.
Martinez and her team uncovered a 1,305-meter (4,281-foot) tunnel, located 13 meters (43 feet) underground, the Egyptian Ministry for Tourism and Antiquities recently announced -- an architectural design experts called an ""engineering miracle.""
""The excavation revealed a huge religious center with three sanctuaries, a sacred lake, more than 1,500 objects, busts, statues, golden pieces, a huge collection of coins portraying Alexander the Great, Queen Cleopatra and the Ptolemies,"" Martinez told CNN.

""The most interesting discovery is the complex of tunnels leading to the Mediterranean Sea and sunken structures,"" she added. Exploring these underwater structures will be the next stage of her search for the Egyptian queen's lost tomb -- a journey that began in 2005.
""My perseverance cannot be confused with obsession. I admire Cleopatra as a historical character. She was a victim of propaganda by the Romans, aiming to distort her image,"" Martinez said.
""She was an educated woman, probably the first one who studied formally at the Museum in Alexandria, the center of culture in her time,"" according to Martinez, who said she admires Cleopatra as a student, a linguist, a mother and a philosopher.
When her husband, the Roman general Mark Antony, died in her arms in 30 BCE, Cleopatra took her own life soon after by allowing an asp to bite her, according to popular belief. The moment has been immortalized in art and literature -- but, more than two millennia later, little is known about where their remains lie.

A series of clues led Martinez to believe Cleopatra's tomb might be located in the Temple of Osiris in the ruined city of Taposiris Magna, on Egypt's northern coast, where the Nile River meets the Mediterranean.
Chief among them was the name itself. According to Martinez, Cleopatra was considered in her time to be ""the human incarnation of the goddess Isis,"" as Antony was considered to be that of the god Orisis, Isis' husband.
Martinez believes Cleopatra may have chosen to bury her husband in the temple to reflect this myth. Of all the 20 temples around Alexandria she has studied, Martinez said, ""no other place, structure or temple combines so many conditions as the temple of Taposiris Magna.""
Excavations so far have unearthed more than 1,500 ancient objects. Credit: Egyptian Ministry of Tourism
In 2004, Martinez took her theory to Zahi Hawass, an Egyptian archaeologist who was then Egypt's minister for antiquities affairs. Her project was approved a year later.
And after years of searching, Martinez feels she is getting close.
The excavations so far have revealed that ""the temple was dedicated to Isis"" -- which Martinez believes is another sign that the lost tomb lies nearby -- as well as the tunnels below the sea.

Now, Martinez said, she is at ""the beginning of a new journey"" -- underwater excavations.
According to a statement issued by the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities, the Egyptian coastline has been battered by earthquakes over the centuries, causing parts of the Taposiris Magna to collapse and sink under the waves.
This is where Martinez and her team are looking next. Although it is ""too early to know where these tunnels lead,"" she is hopeful.
If the tunnels lead to Cleopatra, ""it will be the most important discovery of the century,"" she said.

My son has been asking for a dress. I finally decided to just get him dresses despite being afraid he’d get teased by other kids. Today, the boy next door asked why he was wearing a dress, I said “he wanted one” and he said “okay” then they continued to play. The kids are alright

Get free entry to all US National Park sites on Friday
Forrest Brown, CNN • Published 10th November 2022
Facebook
Twitter
Email
(CNN) — The US National Park Service offers free entry a handful of times each year to all of its more than 400 sites. We're at the last one for 2022.
No fees will be charged to enter any site -- including the marquee names -- on Friday, November 11.
The NPS chose Veterans Day for the last free-entry day to honor the people who have served in the military.
If you wish to commemorate veterans or learn more about US history in general while saving some money, you have have plenty of sites from which to choose, including:
• Antietam National Battlefield in Maryland
• Chickamauga & Chattanooga National Military Park in Georgia and Tennessee
• Fort Davis National Historic Site in Texas
• Fort McHenry National Monument and Historic Shrine in Maryland
• Fort Vancouver National Historic Site in Oregon and Washington
• Golden Spike National Historic Park in Utah
• Perry's Victory and International Peace Memorial in Ohio
• Vicksburg National Military Park in Mississippi
Click here for a full listing of every NPS site, which it calls ""units.""
Most NPS sites are free all year anyway. Only 108 charge a fee. And as you'd suspect, it's mostly the big names that ask you to pay to enter: Places such as Arches in Utah, Rocky Mountain in Colorado and Shenandoah in Virginia.
But they're all free this Friday.
One catch: ""The entrance fee waiver for fee-free days does not cover amenity or user fees for activities such as camping, boat launches, transportation or special tours,"" the NPS says.
Planning pays off
A light autumn snow comes to Yosemite National Park in California. Things can get much deeper there.

If you're not much of a planner, it might be a good idea to develop the habit -- particularly if you want to see a popular NPS site on a free day.
Of those 420+ sites in the National Park System, the top 25 got more than half of the system's total number of visits last year. Some parks set all-time records for visitors in 2021.

If you have a particular site you wish to visit, make sure to check its website first. For instance, popular Yosemite National Park in California's Sierra Nevada mountains can be open in November, but unpredictable autumn snows can cause short-term closures.

'THIS IS LIFE WITH LISA LING'
117 kids and counting! Lisa Ling discovers how, and why, one man has chosen to father so many kids. Watch CNN
Boebert expresses optimism but casts blame on her party with her reelection bid still too close to call
By Chandelis Duster, CNN

CNN
 — 
Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert remained in a tight race Friday morning against Democrat Adam Frisch after redistricting made her bid for reelection to her Colorado seat more competitive.
Boebert, who has expressed confidence about her chances, was ahead of Frisch by 1,122 votes as of 1 p.m. ET Friday. CNN has not yet projected the outcome of the race.
The boundaries of the 3rd Congressional District shifted after Colorado added a new district because the 2020 Census showed population growth, with the state’s independent redistricting commission creating a map that added an eighth seat in the northern suburbs of Denver.
Encompassing the western and southern portions of the state that includes Grand Junction, the majority of residents living in Boebert’s district are White and many residents have traditionally registered as Republican.
As of September 1, nearly 31% of registered voters were Republican, nearly 24% were Democrat and 44% were unaffiliated with a political party, according to the state’s independent redistricting commissions.
Boebert won the county in the 2020 election with 51.4% of the vote, defeating Democrat Diane Mitsch Bush who had 45.2%. Under the new redrawn district, former President Donald Trump would’ve won the district by nearly 8 percentage points but would’ve won by about 5.5 percentage points under the older map.
Boebert suggested to CNN on Thursday that a lack of voter enthusiasm for her party’s candidates for governor and Senate caused her race to be much closer than anticipated.
She noted that Gov. Jared Polis and Sen. Michael Bennet, who are both Democrats, skated to reelection.
“I think Polis and Bennet definitely carried the ticket for the Democrat Party,” she told CNN.
She added, “I don’t know if there wasn’t enough enthusiasm for our top ticket candidates for governor and Senate or what happened there. But there was a lot of shifting of the votes there.”
Boebert still expressed confidence she would eke out a victory. “Of course, I expect to win.”
But Republicans say she didn’t do enough to insulate herself from backlash from voters in her district. Indeed, a GOP source says she was advised to spend more of her campaign cash late in the cycle.
Asked if she believes Republican leaders gave her enough support, Boebert said, “I am my support.”
A mandatory recount is triggered in Colorado if the margin of the vote is .5% or less, though candidates can also choose to pay for a recount if they want. Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold told CNN’s Kate Bolduan Friday afternoon that with thousands of ballots still to be counted, “it’s too early to tell” if there will be one.
“We need to be able to process the rest of the ballots, and then after that, we will do a bipartisan risk-limiting audit which confirms the results followed by a bipartisan canvas and then, only then, do I certify the election and it’s determined whether we go into recount,” Griswold said, adding that “we are a couple weeks out from that determination.”
Boebert has already begun fundraising over the possibility of a recount.
CNN’s Ethan Cohen, Melanie Zanona, Manu Raju and Shawna Mizelle contributed to this report.

Crypto giant files for bankruptcy as CEO resigns in a stunning downfall

How crypto's golden boy lost billions, the end of quiet quitting, and the biggest mistake the Powerball winner can make

New York
CNN Business
 — 
FTX Group said Friday it has filed for bankruptcy in the United States and that its CEO has resigned, marking a stunning downfall for one of the biggest and most powerful players in the crypto industry.
FTX said Sam Bankman-Fried, the 30-year-old founder of the exchange, will remain to assist in an orderly transition. Taking the helm in his place is John J. Ray III, the lawyer who oversaw the liquidation of Enron.
Several employees are expected to stay on to run the company in Chapter 11.
“I’m really sorry, again, that we ended up here,” Bankman-Fried wrote in a Twitter thread Friday. “Hopefully things can find a way to recover.”
The bankruptcy proceedings include FTX US, FTX’s crypto hedge fund Alameda and about 130 other sister companies.
Crypto is in chaos as FTX files for bankruptcy
Ray said bankruptcy protection will give FTX the chance to “assess its situation and develop a process to maximize recoveries for stakeholders.”
In its bankruptcy filing, FTX says it has between $10 billion and $50 billion of estimated liabilities and assets.
The bankruptcy serves two immediate functions, says Eric Snyder, a bankruptcy attorney with Wilk Auslander. It stops any further withdrawals from the exchange and creates a central place to examine all the claims.
“One of the unknowns is where they’re going to get the funds to operate bankruptcy,” he said. “We don’t have an answer to that right now.”
The implosion of FTX, unthinkable just days ago, is shaking the crypto industry to its core. It was triggered by a run-on-the-bank-like crisis after serious questions were raised last week about the health of the FTX balance sheet.
Regulators are now swirling to investigate what went wrong, and some lawmakers are demanding a crackdown.
Securities regulators in the Bahamas, where FTX.com is based, froze some of the embattled exchange’s assets on Thursday. FTX’s Japanese business was put into “close-only mode,” meaning users can only close out their positions, after regulators in that country ordered it to suspend operations.
Both the Justice Department and Securities and Exchange Commission are investigating FTX, The Wall Street Journal reported. The DOJ declined to comment, and the SEC said it does not comment on the existence or nonexistence of investigations.
Bankman-Fried has been one of the faces of the crypto industry, amassing a fortune once totaling $25 billion that has since vanished. He was viewed as the crypto world’s white knight, stepping in to rescue struggling companies. FTX, backed by elite investors like BlackRock and Sequoia Capital, rapidly became one of the biggest crypto exchanges in the world.
FTX spent lavishly to reach endorsement deals with the likes of Gisele, Tom Brady and Steph Curry. The company’s logo and name are splashed on the home of the NBA’s Miami Heat and even on the logos of MLB umpires.
The implosion of FTX was preceded by the decision to lend billions of dollars’ worth of customer assets to fund risky bets by Alameda, the Journal reported on Thursday. Alameda now owes FTX a staggering $10 billion that the exchange had serious trouble raising, the paper said.
It’s not clear what comes next for Bankman-Fried, who has hired Paul Weiss attorney Martin Flumenbaum, a white-collar defense lawyer known for representing junk-bond trader Michael Milken.
“FTX’s bankruptcy underscores crypto’s structural challenges around transparency and poor risk management that, time and again, have led to losses for investors,” said Monsur Hussain, senior director at Fitch Ratings.

World's tallest woman takes her first flight after the airline modifies several seats
AJ Willingham, CNN • Updated 10th November 2022
Facebook
Twitter
Email
(CNN) — Rumeysa Gelgi, the world's tallest living woman, recently boarded an airplane from her home country of Turkey to San Francisco.
However, it wasn't just any flight. It was Gelgi's first, and one that highlighted a growing attention to accessibility.
Gelgi, 25, stands at 7 feet, 0.7 inches tall. Her proportions are a result of Weaver syndrome, a rare genetic condition that causes bone overgrowth. She has been a Guinness World Record celebrity since her teens, and holds records in several size-related categories, including the longest fingers on a living person and the longest back on a living female person.
Gelgi regularly travels to share her story, and uses her warm wit to spread body positivity on social media. However, despite her international profile, she had never flown on an airplane before. Like many people with Weaver syndrome, Gelgi uses mobility aids to get around, and a long flight would require special accommodation for her extraordinary frame.
But in September, Gelgi finally took to the skies. In an Instagram post a few weeks later, she shared photos from her trip aboard Turkish Airlines, which was made possible after the airlines removed several seats on the plane so Gelgi could rest comfortably on a stretcher during the 13-hour journey from Istanbul to California.
""A flawless journey from start to finish,"" Gelgi said on Instagram, praising Turkish Airlines staff and medical personnel for their work. Gelgi said that although it was her first plane ride, ""it certainly won't be my last.""
In her photos, Gelgi appears to get the VIP treatment, conversing with smiling staff aboard the plane and enjoying a first-class meal.
Gelgi, who is a computer programmer as well as a public advocate, says she is spending her time in San Francisco working with Guinness World Records.
CNN has reached out to Turkish Airlines and Guinness World Records for comment.
Making air travel more accessible for everyone
Gelgi's recent trip highlights a growing awareness of airline accessibility for people with physical differences and disabilities. Historically, air travel has been inconvenient at best for such travelers, and, at worst, abusive and painful.
CNN talked to Linda Ristagno, Assistant Director of External Affairs at the International Air Transport Association, which sets global standards for air travel. Ristagno, who recently received the Open Doors Organization's Disability Access Professional Award for her work, described what kinds of global and structural efforts are underway to improve accessibility for all travelers.
""We are devoted to ensuring all passengers can enjoy the freedom of air travel, and we expect standards [among participating airlines and airports] to be consistent so the same level of assistance can be offered to everyone,"" she said.
Related content
Travelers have a lot to say about shrinking airplane seats
Ristagno says a recent meeting of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), a United Nations agency, produced a historic resolution that will better allow different parts of the industry to work together to improve accessibility.
""This resolution encourages governments to collaborate with airlines and disability organizations, and all actors, including travelers with disabilities, to reach solutions,"" she said.
One of the biggest priorities this resolution can help with is the principle of ""universal design,"" in which accessibility is built into the very structure of buildings and mechanisms, rather than treated as an addition or modification.
Additionally, Ristagno says industry groups and state organizations are also trying to improve infrastructure and procedures around the transport of mobility aids such as motorized wheelchairs -- a particular pain point when it comes to accessible travel.
""The root of the challenges airlines face in the loading and safe storage of mobility aids is few have been designed with air transport in mind,"" she explains. ""That becomes even more challenging as mobility aids grow in size, complexity and weight. There is risk of injury in transporting them, and risk of damaging the device.""

By looking at the issue from all angles, air travel groups like IATA, ICAO and participating parties can explore long-term solutions, including design improvements that allow for easier navigation in airports and on planes, and even better-designed mobility aids.
""There's an inherent motivation to raise standards, as these passengers represent a growing section of the demand for air travel,"" Ristagno said. ""Also, disability is a medical term. But accessibility is a social term. We want to make sure we are accessible for all.""

Tunnel discovered beneath Egyptian temple may lead to Cleopatra's tomb, archaeologist says
Updated 10th November 2022

Written by
Christian Edwards, CNN
Kathleen Martinez, an archaeologist at the University of Santo Domingo, has been searching for the lost tomb of Cleopatra for nearly 20 years. Now she believes she's made a pivotal breakthrough.
Martinez and her team uncovered a 1,305-meter (4,281-foot) tunnel, located 13 meters (43 feet) underground, the Egyptian Ministry for Tourism and Antiquities recently announced -- an architectural design experts called an ""engineering miracle.""
""The excavation revealed a huge religious center with three sanctuaries, a sacred lake, more than 1,500 objects, busts, statues, golden pieces, a huge collection of coins portraying Alexander the Great, Queen Cleopatra and the Ptolemies,"" Martinez told CNN.

""The most interesting discovery is the complex of tunnels leading to the Mediterranean Sea and sunken structures,"" she added. Exploring these underwater structures will be the next stage of her search for the Egyptian queen's lost tomb -- a journey that began in 2005.
""My perseverance cannot be confused with obsession. I admire Cleopatra as a historical character. She was a victim of propaganda by the Romans, aiming to distort her image,"" Martinez said.
""She was an educated woman, probably the first one who studied formally at the Museum in Alexandria, the center of culture in her time,"" according to Martinez, who said she admires Cleopatra as a student, a linguist, a mother and a philosopher.
When her husband, the Roman general Mark Antony, died in her arms in 30 BCE, Cleopatra took her own life soon after by allowing an asp to bite her, according to popular belief. The moment has been immortalized in art and literature -- but, more than two millennia later, little is known about where their remains lie.

A series of clues led Martinez to believe Cleopatra's tomb might be located in the Temple of Osiris in the ruined city of Taposiris Magna, on Egypt's northern coast, where the Nile River meets the Mediterranean.
Chief among them was the name itself. According to Martinez, Cleopatra was considered in her time to be ""the human incarnation of the goddess Isis,"" as Antony was considered to be that of the god Orisis, Isis' husband.
Martinez believes Cleopatra may have chosen to bury her husband in the temple to reflect this myth. Of all the 20 temples around Alexandria she has studied, Martinez said, ""no other place, structure or temple combines so many conditions as the temple of Taposiris Magna.""
Excavations so far have unearthed more than 1,500 ancient objects. Credit: Egyptian Ministry of Tourism
In 2004, Martinez took her theory to Zahi Hawass, an Egyptian archaeologist who was then Egypt's minister for antiquities affairs. Her project was approved a year later.
And after years of searching, Martinez feels she is getting close.
The excavations so far have revealed that ""the temple was dedicated to Isis"" -- which Martinez believes is another sign that the lost tomb lies nearby -- as well as the tunnels below the sea.

Now, Martinez said, she is at ""the beginning of a new journey"" -- underwater excavations.
According to a statement issued by the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities, the Egyptian coastline has been battered by earthquakes over the centuries, causing parts of the Taposiris Magna to collapse and sink under the waves.
This is where Martinez and her team are looking next. Although it is ""too early to know where these tunnels lead,"" she is hopeful.
If the tunnels lead to Cleopatra, ""it will be the most important discovery of the century,"" she said.

The Circus Singer
In 2017, CNN reporter Thomas Lake receives a phone call from a circus singer who tells a wild, hard-to-believe story: James Brown didn’t die of natural causes in 2006; instead the Godfather of Soul was murdered. After months of calls from the circus singer, Lake decides to fly to Chicago to meet Jacque Hollander in person. There Jacque proves her connection to James Brown and shows Lake a videotape of a polygraph test she took in 1995 that was administered by a former FBI agent.

Tsunami warning downgraded after large earthquake near Tonga

 — 
A large earthquake hit Tonga on Friday, triggering a tsunami warning and an immediate evacuation order from the government of the island nation.
The government initially asked locals to flee to high ground following what it said was a 7.9 magnitude earthquake originating near the town of Neiafu, on the island of Vava’u, before downgrading the alert and urging the public to take “special caution.”
“Based on tide gauge observation in Tonga, a tsunami wave of 10 centimeters was recorded in Neiafu, Vava’u, 6 centimeters in Niuatoputapu and 5 centimeters recorded in Nuku’alofa tide gauge at 1 a.m. this morning,” the government declared in its latest statement.
Due to the tsunami wave being less than 1 foot, “it is expected that these tsunami waves will only affect our coastlines at this point of time,” it said.
However, ocean currents around marine coastal areas “may be strong and erratic and special caution should be exercised,” the statement warned.
The government also advised the public to stay away from low lying coastal areas, beaches and harbor areas, adding that people should avoid swimming and any related activities until the warning is canceled.
The earthquake occurred at a depth of 10 kilometers (6.2 miles) about 200 kilometers (124 miles) east of Neiafu, according to the government.
The United States Geological Survey (USGA) said Friday a 7.3 magnitude earthquake had been detected 211 kilometers east of Neiafu, Tonga.
Earlier this year, Tonga was hit by a record-breaking eruption from an underwater volcano, which released a huge plume of ash, gas and steam up to 20 kilometers into the atmosphere and sent tsunami waves rolling across the Pacific.
The main island, Tongatapu, suffered significant damage from the tsunami and was smothered in a thick layer of ash.
At least two deaths were reported at the time.

Biden celebrated a major victory on climate this year. But this issue could prove insurmountable
By Ella Nilsen and Aditi Sangal, CNN
Published 6:00 AM EST, Fri November 11, 2022

CNN
 — 
President Joe Biden arrives Friday at the UN’s COP27 summit in Egypt with a climate change victory in-hand: a massive US law passed this year that experts have told CNN will go far to help transition the country to renewable energy.
Democrats’ Inflation Reduction Act contained $370 billion for climate and clean energy tax credits and new programs – the largest climate-related investment in the country’s history and a significant statement that the US is back in the clean-energy race.
But that law left out an important thing: international climate finance – funds to help poorer countries adapt to the climate crisis and grow their economies without becoming dependent on fossil fuel.
The US-China climate deal was a rare bright spot in an otherwise thorny relationship. Should it be mended?
Last year, Biden pledged to contribute $11.4 billion per year to that fund, something he hoped would go a long way in helping developed nations meet the $100 billion a year they pledged to raise by 2020 and have thus far fallen short on.
Whether Biden can marshal that much funding is unclear; while senators attending COP27 told CNN they expect Congress to pass a government spending bill by the end of this year, it remains to be seen whether Biden’s full international goal will be approved.
“We would like, as Democrats, to get a lot of support for the international Green Fund or other means of providing support to transitioning economies into this bill,” said Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island. “The obstacle is Republican opposition, and the Republican opposition is driven by the fossil fuel industry.”
Democratic majorities in the US Senate are already razor thin, meaning Republicans will have significant input on appropriations. And all are watching to see whether the balance of power in Congress could change after a competitive midterm election.
“The politics in Washington is always challenging on any appropriations bill,” Sen. Ben Cardin of Maryland told CNN. “I hope the House is controlled by Democrats, but it’s still going to be challenging to make funds available – we recognize that.”
A senior administration official said that while a new budget bill could pass before a new Congress takes control in January, the potentially shifting politics around the midterms puts big question mark how control of Congress could impact US climate finance in the coming years.
This has quickly become the key issue at COP27 -- and the most difficult to resolve
The US has also shied away from calls for the richest nations to create a so-called “loss and damage” fund, which would help developing countries that are most impacted by the climate crisis – yet have had little hand in creating the problem – to recover after climate disasters. The US has thus far pledged no money to the effort, though Biden’s climate envoy, John Kerry, has said he is committed to talking about a potential fund at COP27.
Kerry told reporters before the summit that “it is imperative for the developed world to help the developing world to deal with the impacts of climate.”
Even if the US is able to walk the talk this year on its domestic climate goals, it will still face questions about whether it can actually meet its global finance commitments, experts said.
“It’s not just about the U.S. and other developed nations reducing emissions. It’s also about what the U.S. does for developing countries to help them along,” said Barry Rabe, Professor of Environmental Policy at University of Michigan. “It becomes a huge challenge for Biden to explain how [the IRA legislation] will benefit other countries.”
Past deadline

One way the US might be able to meet its goals is by leveraging the buying power of the private sector. On Wednesday, Kerry announced a controversial plan to raise cash for climate action by selling carbon credits to companies wishing to offset their polluting emissions.
That plan was met with criticism because of the way it will be financed: carbon credits, which allow companies to pay for someone else to cut their planet-warming emissions, instead of cutting their own.
But Kerry stressed to CNN on Thursday that “that it is one of the few ways that we have” to generate the huge amount of money needed to fund the global clean energy transition.
“We desperately need money,” Kerry told CNN. “It takes trillions and no government that I know of is ready to put trillions into this on an annual basis.”
'We desperately need money,' climate envoy Kerry tells CNN amid criticism of his emission credits plan
The US is not alone in developed countries that have struggled to meet their climate commitments. The United Kingdom has so far failed to deliver more than $300 million it promised last year in international climate finance, a year after that government hosted COP26.
A recent report from the governments of Canada, Germany, and the UK released ahead of COP27 found that overall, the world’s 39 richest countries are failing to meet the annual $100-billion pledge they announced in 2009. But the report noted that there has been some progress, and they are expected to meet it by next year.
In 2020, nations raised $83.3 billion toward the goal, according to a separate report from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development released earlier this year.
The new date nations have outlined to meet their $100 billion goal is 2023, which climate officials from Germany, Canada and the UK insisted would be met.
“Developed countries remain committed to the trajectory on the $100 billion and beyond that was set out in last year’s delivery plan – we do remain on track for delivery in 2023,” COP26 president Alok Sharma told reporters recently.
The world needs India to avert climate catastrophe. Can Modi deliver?
But Sharma and other climate officials acknowledged a lack of trust from developing nations about whether developed nations would indeed meet their commitments given the years of delay.
“It does very much remain the case that developed countries and indeed the whole of the global financial system, need to be doing even more and faster, to support developing nations,” Sharma said. “Ultimately this is all about rebuilding and retaining trust in the system.”
Even though developed nations have been shirking their climate finance commitments for years, the scale of need is growing as global temperatures rise. The UK, Canada and Germany report developed countries and the private sector should increase their financial commitments even more after 2025, with the private sector taking on a larger role as well.
“What this year’s progress report shows is that we’re making progress in some areas, but there are still some challenges that remain,” Canadian Minister of Environment and Climate Change Steven Guilbeault said. “How can developing countries trust we can mobilize more money post-2025?”

It’s always been a rebranding of the idea of just doing what you’re required to do at work, and nothing extra. My guess is in 5 years a new term will come out to describe this same exact thing.

My son has been asking for a dress. I finally decided to just get him dresses despite being afraid he’d get teased by other kids. Today, the boy next door asked why he was wearing a dress, I said “he wanted one” and he said “okay” then they continued to play. The kids are alright

Donald Trump believes we should terminate “all rules, regulations and articles, even those found in the Constitution” to overturn the 2020 election. That was his view on 1/6 and remains his view today. No honest person can now deny that Trump is an enemy of the Constitution.

Florida picks up after Nicole kills at least 5 and leaves ‘unprecedented’ damage to Daytona-area coastline

'We are in trouble here in Daytona': Coastal homes collapse into the ocean
01:00 - Source: CNN
CNN
 — 
As Nicole threatens the Carolinas and Virginia on Friday with tornadoes and flooding, Floridians – many still recovering from Hurricane Ian – are picking up the pieces after this week’s storm killed at least five people and ripped apart buildings with its dangerous storm surge and powerful winds.
Homes are collapsing into the ocean in Florida. Here's what's behind the dangerous situation
In Volusia County, Florida, at least 49 beachfront properties, including hotels and condos, have been deemed “unsafe” in the aftermath of Nicole, which hit Florida’s eastern coast south of Vero Beach as a Category 1 hurricane early Thursday before weakening into a tropical storm and eventually becoming a post-tropical cyclone Friday afternoon.
“The structural damage along our coastline is unprecedented,” Volusia County Manager George Recktenwald said in a news conference, adding more buildings will likely be identified as compromised.
Track Nicole here >>
As the storm – the first hurricane to hit the US in November in nearly 40 years – walloped Florida, Ian-battered coastal buildings were compromised even more by coastal erosion. Deputies went door to door Wednesday evacuating residents from structurally unsound buildings in Volusia County ahead of Nicole’s arrival.
In Wilbur-By-The-Sea – a barrier island community off Daytona Beach – 22 homes were evacuated in advance after officials deemed them unsafe.
Then amid Nicole, some oceanfront homes collapsed into the ocean.
Homes are partially toppled Thursday onto Daytona Beach, Florida, after Hurricane Nicole made landfall.

Trip Valigorsky unlocked the front door to his home to see a gaping hole leading to crashing ocean waves where his living room had once stood. Pointing to where the television and sofa used to be, he told CNN affiliate WKMG he was in shock.
“I was here Tuesday night and I kind of watched the wall deteriorate, and then I woke up Wednesday morning and the wall was completely gone, so I started evacuating,” Valigorsky said. “And now here we are.”
Nicole also pushed a huge volume of water onshore, tearing through infrastructure already strained by Ian.
Storm surge peaked Thursday morning at around 6 feet, sending rising ocean water to streets. A lower surge also pushed ashore on top of exceptionally high tides associated with this week’s full moon, keeping water levels high longer.
Homes nearly hung off cliffs and Daytona Beach hotels crumbled into the ocean in the storm’s aftermath, drone video showed.
“The devastation is almost impossible to comprehend. Imagine watching your home collapse into the ocean,” Volusia County Sheriff Mike Chitwood tweeted.
Some areas will see strong wind gusts
At least 2 reported dead as Nicole weakens after striking Florida's east coast as the first US hurricane in November in nearly 40 years
While many people in the Carolinas and Georgia were under wind advisories earlier in the day, areas of Massachusetts, New Jersey and New York will be under one from Friday night through Saturday morning, according to the National Weather Service. Gusts of up to 50 mph were possible.
Tornado watches that were in effect for several states Friday were canceled as of 6 p.m. ET.
This system is expected to produce an additional 1 to 3 inches of rain across the central Appalachians, mid-Atlantic, and New England through Saturday morning, before pushing away from the US East Coast, according to the US Weather Prediction Center.
As remnants of Nicole move northward through Saturday, its tropical moisture will be absorbed by a separate cold front, which delivered blizzard conditions across the northern Plains, CNN Meteorologist Derek Van Dam said.
Heavy rain and gusty winds in excess of 30 mph will make traveling along the Interstate 95 corridor tricky. Meanwhile, airline travel will likely be disrupted at many East Coast airports as the storm moves through. Newark International on Friday evening was seeing average delays of 63 minutes due to high winds, according to the Federal Aviation Administration.
5 deaths reported as many still lack power
As the colossal storm approached Florida, schools and universities closed, hundreds of flights were canceled, airports halted operations and some coastal residents were evacuated.
After Nicole passed through, streets were left flooded, roads and homes were damaged, and thousands were without power. More than 300,000 customers in Florida were affected by outages earlier; the number had fallen by Friday evening to about 8,000, according to PowerOutage.us.
Two people died after being “electrocuted by a downed power line” in Orange County, the sheriff’s office said in a news release. Two additional deaths are being investigated as possibly storm-related following a fatal car accident, according to Orange County Mayor Jerry Demings.
Also killed was a 68-year-old Port Canaveral man who had been on a yacht early Thursday morning as it was “being battered by the waves and the dock,” the Cocoa Police Department said. After his wife called 911 to report her husband was in distress, rescuers took the couple to a hospital. He was later pronounced deceased, police said, adding the cause of death isn’t yet determined.
Downed power lines in flooded streets are among a multitude of hazards residents must maneuver in the hurricane’s wake as they return to their homes, and crews work to clear debris from roadways and conduct emergency repairs to washed out roads.
CNN’s Haley Brink, Rachel Ramirez and Jamiel Lynch contributed to this report.

GET '5 THINGS' IN YOUR INBOX
If your day doesn’t start until you’ve gotten up to speed on the latest headlines, then let us introduce you to your new favorite morning fix. Sign up here for the ‘5 Things’ newsletter.
Today is Veterans Day, federal holiday in the US honoring men and women who have served in the armed forces. Regional observances and events are set to take place across the country to pay tribute to millions of American heroes. Entry to all US National Parks is also free today – including the most popular ones which often draw record crowds.
Here’s what else you need to know to Get Up to Speed and On with Your Day.
(You can get “5 Things You Need to Know Today” delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.)
1. Midterms
Votes are still being counted in critical House and Senate races that will decide who controls Congress next year. In the race for the Senate, election officials say it may take hours – or days – to count the more than 500,000 votes remaining in Arizona and about 95,000 others in Nevada. Republicans need to pick off two Democratic seats to win the Senate majority. Meanwhile, there are many key races that have yet to be called that will determine the future of the House in January. Republicans appear to be slowly inching toward the 218 seats that would deliver them a narrow victory, but incoming results from California and Colorado could ultimately determine which party controls the chamber.
2. Student loans
A federal judge has struck down President Joe Biden’s student loan forgiveness program, declaring it illegal. Biden’s program was already on hold due to a separate legal challenge, but a new lawsuit filed by a conservative group will delay student loan relief even further. On Thursday, a Texas federal judge – who was nominated by then-President Donald Trump – found that the executive branch does not have clear congressional authorization to create the student loan forgiveness program. The Biden administration is appealing the decision. As for the 26 million borrowers who already provided their necessary details to be considered for debt forgiveness, the Department of Education “will hold onto their information so it can quickly process their relief once we prevail in court,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement.
3. Storm damage
At least four people have been killed after Nicole hit Florida’s eastern coast as a Category 1 hurricane this week. Photos of the damage show buildings and homes that have been ripped apart in the wake of dangerous storm surge and powerful winds. Streets remain flooded and thousands of customers are still without power this morning. Nicole weakened into a tropical depression Thursday, according to the National Hurricane Center. However, the subsiding storm has headed north, moving into southwestern Georgia today. It’s expected to cross the western Carolinas later this evening. View CNN’s storm tracker here to see Nicole’s path.

4. Grocery prices
Americans grappling with high inflation are finally getting some relief at the grocery store. Prices overall have surged 12.4% through October versus a year ago, but analysts at the market research firm NielsenIQ say there are some deals to be had. In fresh produce, the average price for prepared mixed vegetables dropped 68% versus the same period last year. A lot of fresh seafood options are cheaper as well: striped bass fell 41.8% over the prior year while the cost of lobster is also down 7.2%. Some packaged baked goods such as assorted bagels fell 48%. Bakery sweet goods and cranberry sauce are also seeing declining prices just in time for the holidays. And in beverages, kombucha drinks have dropped 22.7%. Most consumers are also not buying in bulk, analysts say, as more shoppers are opting for smaller sizes to control their spending.

5. Climate
President Biden is heading to a UN summit today where he is expected to tout his climate record. In a speech to the COP27 summit in Egypt, Biden will proclaim the US is back as a global leader on climate change following passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, which included around $370 billion in clean energy incentives meant to slash the use of harmful greenhouse gases. However, many nations attending this week’s conference are focused on another matter: demanding climate reparations be paid by wealthy and high-emitting countries like the US to smaller, poorer nations that have felt the outsized effects of climate change. Biden has struggled to gain backing in Congress for global climate resilience funding, which would help low-income nations. And if Republicans gain control of one or both chambers, the prospects of any new climate legislation over the next two years appears dim.

TODAY’S NUMBER
1,203 points
That’s how much the Dow rose on Thursday, making it the best day for US stocks since 2020. The boost came after new government data showed that price increases eased in October. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq also posted their biggest percentage jumps since spring 2020 , up 5.5% and 7.3% respectively. Wall Street is now hoping that the data will help convince the Federal Reserve to pull back on the size and pace of its next interest rate increases.
TODAY’S QUOTE
“He’s someone I’ve known for a decade, and I’ve never heard an antisemitic word from him or, frankly, hate directed at any group.”
– NBA commissioner Adam Silver, saying on Thursday that he doesn’t believe Kyrie Irving is antisemitic. Silver, who is Jewish, told the New York Times that the two had “a direct and candid conversation” at the league’s headquarters this week. Silver’s remarks come after the Brooklyn Nets suspended Irving last week for a minimum of five games after he doubled down on his decision to share a link to an antisemitic documentary with his millions of followers on social media. Silver told the Times he has watched the film and concluded that it “was indeed hate speech.” The NBA and the Nets will consult to decide when Irving can return from his suspension, Silver added.

Veterans and scientists fulfill ‘no man left behind,’ returning long-lost American remains from lonely Pacific WWII battlefield

 — 
On a remote Pacific sandbar, replete with the ravages of war, a small group of veterans, volunteers and archeologists are doing their best to keep the enduring promise of “no man left behind.”
According to the Department of Defense, nearly half of the known American casualties from the Battle of Tarawa were never recovered. Approximately 1,000 Marines and sailors lost their lives on the small sandbar November 20-23, 1943, in the US military’s first offensive of the war in the central Pacific.
The graves of more than 30 Marines and sailors killed in bloody World War II battle have been found
Graves remained lost for decades, Pentagon historians write, because of bad record keeping, poor memories, and in some instances, war infrastructure inadvertently built over service members’ unmarked final resting places. DOD records show by 1950, a military board declared hundreds of Americans who fought and died on the island “non-recoverable,” leaving families without words, images or ideas of where the young men rested.
After excavation efforts paused during the pandemic, teams will return to the lonely atoll, with the goal of returning as many remains of US service members as they can.
A WWII history buff, vets, and archeologists find lost 1943 graves
“This is not a normal thing for somebody to be doing,” said Paul Schwimmer, a retired US Army Green Beret who searches for American remains with the non-profit group, History Flight, who added a new chapter of history is unfolding along the isolated and idyllic shore.
“Don’t tell us these men are not recoverable, give us a chance to go after them.”
Government figures show 72,627 Americans are currently classified as missing in action from World War II. There are more US troops missing from 1941-1945, than from all other wars with US involvement combined.
In 2003, commercial pilot and World War II history aficionado Mark Noah founded History Flight. The group’s initial aim was to preserve American aviation history, an outgrowth of Noah’s love of antiquity, aircraft and his family tradition of scholarship.
An American family finds closure as a WWII hero finally comes home
“My father was a diplomat for the State Department, a Harvard and MIT-trained sinologist,” Noah said in an interview with CNN. “I was born in China, where my dad was posted, and I was able to see the lingering effects of World War II up close. That was the beginning of a fascination with the Second World War.”
Noah relates the multitude of missing service members to those missing in his own life.
“Four of my close friends in Beijing disappeared during Tiananmen Square,” Noah said. “And I’ve always wondered where they fell into, this deep void, the unknown. And at a subconscious level, it’s one of the reasons why I’m driven to find our missing Americans, especially when we know where they are, on an island.”
Noah said 2008 was a turning point, when History Flight’s mission changed from aviation to recovery missions.

“I was doing research about a missing airplane that crashed in the lagoon of Tarawa, and I was shocked at just how many people were missing on this small island,” Noah said.
“So, I self-funded what became our first Tarawa excavation, and with all of those people missing in such a small place, we chose Tarawa because we thought we could deliver a project with a high probability of success.” The cost was $25,000, with a team of 10 people.
A cadre of veterans, scientists and students interviewed residents who found bones underneath their homes. The non-profit also used ground-penetrating radar on the atoll, ultimately finding scores of American graves buried within a working commercial seaport.
In the decade since its first dig, History Flight has led to the identification of 96 American service members killed on Tarawa, according to the branch of the Pentagon charged with finding US military remains, the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency.
“That number undoubtedly will go up,” agency spokesperson Johnie Webb said.

In a cozy East Wenatchee, Washington, living room, twins Don and David McCannel held the crumbling and corroded helmet buried with their uncle, Gunnery Sgt. Arthur B. Summers, a Tarawa Marine once considered missing in action.
Summers’ near-complete skeleton is among the latest remains discovered by History Flight. His return home for burial in America followed a now familiar ritual of repatriation: Delicately-handled bones are discovered on Tarawa, then flown to the US for positive identification, and finally, re-buried with full military honors.
The McCannel twins are now 76 years old, born three years after a telegram told their mother Summers was killed in action, his body missing on a faraway Pacific island.
“My most vivid memory is, when I was about 10 years old, my mother said to me, ‘my brother was killed in Tarawa and his body was never recovered,’” David McCannel described in an interview. “She didn’t cry. She just said he’s gone forever.”
10 ways to honor veterans beyond Veterans Day
Schwimmer, the retired Green Beret with History Flight, said he was within the Tarawa excavation site when Summers’ remains were discovered in 2019, and attended Summers’ Washington funeral in August 2022.
“To see this, to look over my shoulder, to put my hand on the casket and say, ‘Hey bud, I saw you in 2019. I took you from Tarawa to here.’ For me, that’s great,” Schwimmer said. “Now, put me back on an airplane, get me in the field, I got work to do.”
Summers was killed on November 23, 1943, the final day of fighting on the island, and according to military records, the day Summers’ second enlistment extension was to expire.
“I thank them eternally, and forever,” Don McCannel said of History Flight and those responsible for Summers’ identification. “My uncle Arthur did his duty, and these men and women today did theirs, truly.”

No margin for error
The Pentagon agency tasked with finding the remains of an astounding 81,500 Americans missing since World War I, contracts Tarawa excavation work with History Flight. But the agency itself is solely responsible for the process of DNA identification.
There is no margin for error. Scientists and military personnel from Hawaii, Nebraska and Delaware finish the process of uniting stories, names, and family histories with the skeletal remains of US troops.

Dr. John Byrd, the agency’s laboratory director, explained the challenges of dealing with DNA from that era. “They’re highly degraded, there’s only a tiny amount of DNA left in there at all. And our DNA lab is the best in the world at extracting what little bit is left in there.”
Byrd said the average time to identify an individual is 2.5 years, but can be as quickly as two weeks.
“When none of the stars are aligned, it can take several years. We have ID’s we’ve made after more than 10 years, when we finally got enough evidence together to be able to prove the identity.”
For Summers’ remains, delivered to the agency’s Pearl Harbor laboratory in July 2019, the DOD agency was able to make a positive DNA identification in a matter of months, on October 17, 2019.
The identification process explained
First, remains arrive at an agency laboratory in Honolulu, or Omaha, Nebraska. “They come from a variety of sources, from our own excavations, and from excavations from our partners … We also do a lot of disinterments of unknown remains, right from our national cemeteries,” Byrd explained.
Next, as the remains are assigned to evidence managers, scientists determine which tests are needed to identify the remains. The majority will involve DNA testing, but other methods, such as dental records, can be used.

DNA testing and other identification work then begins. Samples are sent to the Armed Forces DNA Identification Lab in Dover, Delaware, and a type of identification known as stable isotope analysis can also be performed at the agency’s Pearl Harbor lab. The isotope testing is used to trace remains’ geographic origin.
Finally, test results are evaluated, and perhaps even more testing is needed.
“You love it when the test results come back in, and they clearly direct you to one individual that these remains should be,” Byrd said. “But we also sometimes get results that aren’t strong enough to point to one person only. And then we have to find another way to try to resolve the case other than the testing we did in the first round … that is one of the most difficult steps for many of our cases.”
Work is still to be done
History Flight estimates their Tarawa excavation efforts are halfway finished.
“We believe about 250 sets of remains can still be found, and we want to keep going,” History Flight founder Mark Noah said.
Get it straight: The difference between Memorial Day and Veterans Day
The non-profit’s vice president, retired U.S. Marine Corps Sgt. Maj. Justin LeHew, is currently walking across America, from Boston to Newport, Oregon, to donations for the group’s ongoing work in the Pacific.
LeHew served in the 2nd Marine Division, the same (albeit modern day) combat element which engaged in the Battle of Tarawa in November 1943. His previous chapter of military service includes receiving the Navy Cross, awarded for his 2003 role in rescuing ambushed soldiers in Iraq, including Pfc. Jessica Lynch.
“Team members are putting in the work for the missing,” LeHew wrote on Facebook, as his walk on U.S. Highway 20, America’s longest road, approached Yellowstone National Park.
“This specific road was selected to highlight the long journey home that over 81,000 missing U.S. Servicemembers have been trying to make since World War II,” LeHew said.
“We know that we can fulfill this promise of ‘no one left behind’ on Tarawa,” Noah added. “We simply need people to know we’re there, to know about us, put the financial resources in place, and help us carry on this sacred mission.”

States are counting votes with key races still in play. Here’s what to know

 — 
New batches of votes were reported Friday in Arizona and Nevada – states with key races that will determine control of the Senate – but it’s still not clear when enough of the outstanding hundreds of thousands of ballots will be counted to call the Senate and gubernatorial contests in those states.
Control of the House is also still in the balance as ballots are counted in states such as California. Republicans appear to be inching toward a majority, though they have not yet secured enough wins to take control as more than two dozen congressional races remain uncalled.
The closer-than-expected contest for the House has added serious complications to GOP leader Kevin McCarthy’s potential bid to be the next speaker. And in the Senate, several Republicans, including Marco Rubio of Florida and Josh Hawley, are calling for a delay in next week’s Senate GOP leadership elections. While Mitch McConnell is widely expected to easily win the top Republican spot again, making him the longest Senate party leader in history, he faces some dissension in the ranks.
More votes are expected to be reported Friday evening as counting continues. Arizona’s most populous county, Maricopa, is planning to release on Friday evening around 10 p.m. ET – the first batch of results from the 290,000 mail-in ballots that voters dropped off on Election Day, a top county official told CNN. The partisan composition of those votes could determine who wins the state’s Senate and governor’s races.
Here’s what to know about where things stand:
What is taking so long to count ballots in key states?
The biggest reason the vote counting is taking so long is the way that each state handles the ballots outside of those cast at polling places on Election Day, including both early votes and mail-in ballots.
INTERACTIVE:
How many votes are left? Control of Congress hangs in this final count
When races are within a percentage point or two, those outstanding ballots are enough to keep the election from being projected. Of course, the lag was anticipated – it took news organizations until the Saturday after Election Day in 2020 to declare Joe Biden the winner in the presidential race, following a massive increase in mail-in voting amid the pandemic.
In Arizona, CNN and other news networks have yet to call the Senate race between Democratic incumbent Mark Kelly and Republican challenger Blake Masters, or the governor’s race between Democrat Katie Hobbs and Republican Kari Lake.
Arizona Assistant Secretary of State Allie Bones told CNN Friday that the majority of votes left to be tabulated in Arizona are in Maricopa and Pima counties, which are both historically Democratic strongholds.
Maricopa County is expected to report on approximately 80,000 ballots at 10p.m. ET Friday. After that, the county will have about 300,000 ballots left to count.
Included in both the Maricopa and Pima county releases Friday will be absentee ballots dropped off on Election Day, Bones added, acknowledging that the partisan lean of the absentee ballots dropped off on Election Day is the “big question before us right now.”
The latest on the 2022 midterm elections
The mail-in ballots reported so far in Arizona lean heavily Democratic while Election Day ballots strongly favor Republicans – but it’s still too early to know which way the mail-in ballots turned in on Election Day will fall.
More than half of the votes released Friday evening in Maricopa County will be absentee ballots that voters dropped off at polling places on Election Day – the first report to include ballots from this large batch.
The total will also include some of the 17,000 Election Day ballots that were not able to be read by tabulator machines due to technical issues that day, and the remainder of early votes the county received before Election Day.
Pima County, Arizona’s second-most populous and home to Tucson, is expected to have roughly 85,000 ballots left to count at the end of Friday, Constance Hargrove, elections director for the county, told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer and John King Friday.
Hargrove said the county had scanned 15,000 votes Friday and was planning to tabulate another 9,800.
She said she hopes by Monday that Pima County will have the majority of the remaining votes counted. She had previously told CNN that all the votes would be counted by Monday morning. However, on Friday night she clarified that would no longer be the case due to a large batch of around 80,000 votes they received from the recorder’s office earlier that day.
Pushing back on criticisms and conspiracies
The delay in calling the races in Arizona have prompted criticisms and conspiracies – some of which are reminiscent of the wild and baseless allegations that were made in the state after the 2020 election, such as false claims about felt-tipped Sharpies.
Elections officials in Maricopa County debunked false claims circulating on right-wing social media suggesting that a woman wearing glasses in the county’s counting facility livestream was Hobbs, the Democratic gubernatorial nominee and current secretary of state.
How election officials staved off chaos at polling places Tuesday
“Not every woman with glasses is Katie Hobbs,” the official Twitter account of Maricopa County tweeted in response Thursday evening. “We can confirm this was a party Observer. Please refrain from making assumptions about workers who happen to wear glasses.”
Lake, the GOP gubernatorial nominee who has embraced former President Donald Trump’s lies that the 2020 election was stolen, said on Charlie Kirk’s right-wing talk show Thursday, “I hate that they’re slow-rolling and dragging their feet and delaying the inevitable. They don’t want to put out the truth, which is that we won.” There is no evidence that the election officials were deliberately delaying the reporting of results.
At a news conference Thursday, Gates said, “Quite frankly, it is offensive for Kari Lake to say that these people behind me are slow-rolling this when they are working 14-18 hours.”
Why it takes so long to count West Coast votes
Gates explained why it takes longer for Arizona to count ballots than states such as Florida, which reported most of its results on election night. He pointed out that Florida does not allow for mail-in ballots to be dropped off on Election Day, while Arizona does. This slows down the process because the hundreds of thousands of ballots need to be processed and go through signature verification before they can be counted.
Florida also closes early voting the Sunday before Election Day, while ballots can be dropped off through Election Day in Arizona.
“We have so many close races that everyone is still paying attention to Maricopa County. Those other states like Florida, those races were blowouts. Nobody is paying attention anymore,” Gates said.
Asked by King to address claims of potential “hanky panky,” Hargrove reiterated that they are not “finding” votes, they are counting votes. Representatives from both parties are monitoring the process, she said.
Nevada mail-in ballots still arriving
In Nevada, the CNN Decision Desk estimated there were about 95,000 votes outstanding as of Thursday evening.
In Clark County, the state’s largest, which includes Las Vegas, there are more than 50,000 ballots still to be counted, Clark County registrar Joe Gloria said Friday.
Gloria said Friday that the county expected to be largely finished with the remaining 34,130 mail-in votes by Saturday. Those ballots are being inspected at the county’s counting board, Gloria said, and some could also be reported Friday night.
More than 15,000 additional ballots could also eventually be counted if they meet eligibility requirements. Monday is the deadline for voters who need to contact the Clark County elections department to cure their ballots by providing additional details to verify their ballot. Gloria said 9,659 are eligible to be cured. Another 5,555 in-person provisional ballots could be added as well once they are validated.
Nevada state law allows mail-in ballots to be received through Saturday, as long as they were postmarked by Election Day, meaning counties are still receiving ballots to be counted. But many ballots now arriving are being disqualified because they were postmarked after Election Day.
Jamie Rodriguez, interim registrar of votes for Washoe County, said the county disqualified 400 mail-in ballots on Thursday – about two-thirds of the mail-in ballots the county received – because they were postmarked late.
Washoe County, which includes Reno, still has about 22,000 ballots left to count, Rodriguez said, and the county expects to get through most of them on Friday.
Clark County added around 12,000 votes on Thursday night. The county says it will provide an update Friday on its remaining ballots to count.
Key races in the Silver State, including the Senate contest between Democratic incumbent Catherine Cortez Masto and Republican challenger Adam Laxalt and the governor’s race between Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak and Republican Joe Lombardo, have not been called as of Friday morning.
McCarthy’s rocky path
Control of the Senate – which will come down to Nevada, Arizona and possibly the December runoff in Georgia – was expected to be a toss-up going into Election Day. Republicans, however, anticipated winning the House, though the closer-than-expected contest for control of the chamber has made McCarthy’s quest for the speakership more difficult, even if Republicans do end up winning the majority.
Trump grapples with 2024 questions amid GOP midterm letdown
Members of the pro-Trump House Freedom Caucus are withholding their support for McCarthy’s speakership bid and have begun to lay out their list of demands, CNN’s Melanie Zanona and Manu Raju report, putting the California Republican’s path to securing 218 votes in peril if the party ultimately takes the House with a slim majority.
McCarthy and his team are confident he will get the votes to be speaker. But conservative hard-liners are emboldened by the likelihood of a narrow House GOP majority and are threatening to force him to make deals to weaken the speakership, which he has long resisted.
The ultimate makeup of the House is important for McCarthy because of the way the chamber elects a speaker: It requires a majority of the full House, or 218 votes, not just a majority of the party in control. If Republicans take power with a double-digit majority, McCarthy could afford to lose a few defectors. But a slim majority gives single members – and the Freedom Caucus – more power to make demands and threaten to withhold support.
House Freedom Caucus Chair Scott Perry met with McCarthy in his office on Friday. He said later that the meeting “went well” but wouldn’t say if McCarthy has his – or the caucus’ – support for speaker.
“We’re having discussions,” Perry said as he left McCarthy’s office after a half-hour meeting.
Meanwhile, several Republican senators are calling for a delay in the Senate GOP leadership elections currently scheduled for Wednesday, November 16. Rubio and Hawley shared their views on Twitter. Sens. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, Rick Scott of Florida and Mike Lee of Utah are also urging members of the GOP conference to postpone leadership elections, according to sources familiar with the matter, and are circulating a letter that underscores Senate Republicans’ frustration with the outcome of the 2022 elections.
Former President Donald Trump is calling up his allies in the Senate, GOP sources told CNN Friday, ginning up opposition for McConnell, while blaming the Senate minority leader – and not himself – for Republicans’ lackluster midterm performance.
Many key House races have yet to be called, and some remain razor-thin and could head into recounts. One such race is in Colorado, where GOP Rep. Lauren Boebert was ahead by just 1,122 votes as of 9 a.m. ET Friday. Votes are still being counted in the district.
Jena Griswold, Colorado’s Democratic secretary of state, told CNN’s Kate Bolduan on Friday that it was still “too early to tell” whether the race would go to a recount, as the state has to certify the results first. Under Colorado law, a recount is triggered if the race is within 0.5%. It may also be conducted if a candidate chooses to pay for one.
“We are a couple weeks out from that determination,” Griswold said.
CNN’s Josh Campbell, Chandelis Duster, Alli Gordon, Annie Grayer, Christina Maxouris, Ella Nilsen, Donie O’Sullivan, Manu Raju, Paul Vercammen and Melanie Zanona contributed to this report.

Election officials urge patience as counting goes on in critical House and Senate races

 — 
Election officials are urging patience and trying to tamp down on conspiracy theories about why the vote count in western states isn’t yet done as control of the House and Senate hangs in the balance.
About 540,000 votes in Arizona and 95,000 in Nevada remained to be counted as of Thursday evening, CNN estimated. The counting in California – where there are more than a dozen key House races – could continue for weeks. But the fact that these uncalled races are impacting control of Congress underscores just how far short Republicans have fallen of their goal of building a red wave.
Why it takes so long to count West Coast votes
The GOP was expecting to benefit from President Joe Biden’s low approval ratings, the rough economic climate and the fact the president’s party usually faces steep losses in the first midterm of a new administration. But with the nation still in suspense over the final outcome three days after Election Day, the Republican blame game was in full swing by Thursday.
Retiring Pennsylvania Sen. Pat Toomey – a Republican who will be replaced by Democrat John Fetterman – bluntly pointed to the role that former President Donald Trump played in the midterms. His backing of weak, election-denying candidates who prioritized loyalty to him over the general electorate created a drag on other Republican candidates, Toomey said.
“At the top of the ticket in the gubernatorial race, we had an ultra-MAGA candidate who never appeared to even attempt to expand beyond a hardcore base that was very, very committed to him,” Toomey told CNN’s Erin Burnett, alluding to Pennsylvania GOP gubernatorial nominee Doug Mastriano, who lost by double digits.
Toomey argued that the GOP had lost three House seats in the commonwealth that he believed they should have had a good chance of picking up, because of “a real problem at the top of the ticket” in Mastriano, but “also President Trump inserting himself into the race” by coming to Pennsylvania in the final days of the election.
States are counting votes with key races hanging in the balance. Here's what to know
“We were at a time when it’s good for Republicans for the race to be about President Biden, who is not popular and whose policies have failed,” the retiring senator said, “and instead President Trump had to insert himself and that changed the nature of the race and that created just too much of an obstacle. … It’s not just Pennsylvania. All over the country – there’s a very high correlation between MAGA candidates and big losses, or at least dramatically underperforming.”
After Democrats flipped Pennsylvania’s Senate seat, Republicans need to pick up two Democratic-held seats to win the majority. The balance of power has come down to races in three states: Arizona and Nevada – where Democrats are defending seats in races too early to call – and Georgia, where Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock and Republican Herschel Walker are headed to a December 6 runoff, CNN projects.
In Nevada, Republican Adam Laxalt, the state’s former attorney general, was narrowly leading Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto late Thursday night. In Arizona, Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly had a slightly larger lead over Republican Blake Masters.

How many votes are left? Control of Congress hangs in this final count
The top Republican in the House, Kevin McCarthy, didn’t wait for the the majority to be called before launching his campaign for speaker. But the smaller-than-expected size of the prospective GOP majority is already turning up the heat the California Republican is facing from conservative pro-Trump factions of his conference. Those members will likely now have more leverage than might have been the case with a broader GOP majority.
The right-wing House Freedom Caucus has yet to commit to supporting McCarthy and on Thursday laid out demands including, rule changes designed to lessen the power of the speaker over the Republican conference. Some members want more details on the leader’s plans to pursue investigations into the Biden administration. Arizona Rep. Andy Biggs, for example, is upset that McCarthy appeared to backpedal on the question of whether to impeach President Joe Biden, CNN’s Melanie Zanona reported.
McCarthy has been calling members over the last few days and enjoys substantial goodwill among many of them for his prodigious fundraising and campaigning.
One of those incoming members who benefited from McCarthy’s midterm campaign push is Rep.-elect Michael Lawler, who defeated the head of the House Democrats’ campaign arm. Besides netting another seat for the GOP, his victory over Democratic Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney is also a symbolic win for Republicans who’d been looking to send a message about their strength, especially in a blue state.
Lawler told Burnett on Thursday he would back McCarthy for speaker.
While Biden is still expected to face a punishing slate of House investigations targeting his policies, his administration and his son Hunter’s business dealings, he has reacted buoyantly to staving off the midterm shellacking experienced by most recent predecessors.
He left for a trip to Egypt and Asia Thursday evening prepared to tell allied world leaders worried about the prospects of a return of Trump-style disruption that US democracy had passed its first test since the US Capitol insurrection in 2021.
‘We can be patient’
As some conservatives made baseless suggestions, Nevada and Arizona election officials on Thursday tried to dispel misinformation about how long their respective counties were taking to count.
During an appearance on right-wing activist Charlie Kirk’s talk show, Arizona GOP gubernatorial nominee Kari Lake said she felt “100% confident that we are going to win this” but accused election officials of “slow-rolling and dragging their feet and delaying the inevitable.”
Lake, who has repeatedly embraced Trump’s 2020 election falsehoods, is running against Democrat Katie Hobbs, the Arizona secretary of state who rebuffed GOP efforts to overturn Biden’s win in the state.
'That certainly didn't help': GOP blame game spreads after midterm shortfalls
Maricopa County Board of Supervisors Chairman Bill Gates, a Republican, called Lake’s comments “offensive.”
“Quite frankly, it is offensive for Kari Lake to say that these people behind me are slow rolling this when they are working 14-18 hours,” said Gates, gesturing to election workers tabulating ballots. “So I really hope this is the end of that now. We can be patient and respect the results when they come out.”
Maricopa County – the state’s most populous county – plans to release around 62,000 ballots each evening, including over the weekend, Gates said.
Nevada’s system was seized on by Trump, who claimed without evidence on his social media platform on Thursday that Clark County “has a corrupt voting system.” He told Laxalt to “be careful” – stoking misinformation about the county as he did in his presidential race two years ago.
Clark County Registrar of Voters Joe Gloria responded by telling reporters the former president is “misinformed, two years later, about the law and our election processes which ensure the integrity of elections in Clark County and the state.”
Under Nevada law, counties can receive mail-in ballots postmarked by Election Day through Saturday. Voters also have until Monday to fix any problems with their signatures on the ballots.
“We’re working as hard as we possibly can in order to get the ballots counted,” Gloria said. “But whether we like it or not, there’s no way that we can move any faster than we’re currently moving.”

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez says she feels in danger in current political environment

 — 
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said that she “absolutely” has felt her life is in danger since joining Congress, with her head always “on a swivel” when she’s in public amid the nation’s charged political environment.
“It is a very real dynamic and very unfortunately and tragically we’ve seen political violence play out,” the New York Democrat told CNN’s Chris Wallace on “Who’s Talking to Chris Wallace?”
The New York Democrat said the deluge of threats against her means “when I wake up in the morning, I hesitate to walk my dog. It means when I come home, I have to ask my fiancé to come out to where my car is to walk me just from my car to my front door.”
“It means that there’s just – a general disposition where you kind of feel like there’s almost a static electricity around you,” she said.

The recent attack on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s husband has touched off fresh concern about violence against lawmakers and their families. Federal law enforcement agencies have consistently warned about the increasing threat of politically motivated violence after January 6, 2021, raising specific concerns about the likelihood that online calls for violence result in real-world attacks.
Ocasio-Cortez’s progressive credentials have made her the ire of many congressional Republicans and their supporters. She told The New York Times this fall that her office struggles to keep up with “astronomical” amount of threats she receives each day.
Such an environment, Ocasio-Cortez told CNN, has influenced her approach to her work, pushing her to be “as robust and urgent as possible.”
“I don’t want to take the time I have for granted. I don’t know if I’m going to be there to see us achieve guaranteed health care in the United States. So I need to advocate it in a very fully throated way right now,” she said.
“Similar to a full path to citizenship for millions of people in this country. I just have to be out and say it and at least leave a roadmap should I not be there.”
Asked about the future of Democratic leadership in Congress, Ocasio-Cortez, speaking broadly, said, “I do believe we need to have not just generational shifts, but potentially substantive shifts as well.”
“I think that and I hope that what we’ve seen, whether people think it’s too left or too right, or up or down or whatever, it may be that we shift in a direction where the leadership of the Democratic Party is less reliant on large and corporate donors and sponsorship, because that does have a shaping effect of our legislative priorities,” she said.

Flu season already hitting hard across half of the US and children’s hospitals are still feeling the pressure from respiratory illnesses

 — 
About half of the US – 22 states, along with Washington, DC, New York City and Puerto Rico – is reporting high or very high respiratory illness activity, as flu season sweeps through the country weeks earlier than usual.
Multiple respiratory viruses are circulating nationwide – including flu, RSV and the virus that causes Covid-19 – and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention tweeted Thursday that flu is contributing to a “significant proportion” of that circulation.
RSV responsible for 1 in 50 child deaths under age 5, study estimates
And influenza activity continues to increase: After nearly doubling in the last week of October, the number of flu illnesses, hospitalizations and deaths this season took another significant jump in the first week of November. The CDC now estimates that there have been at least 2.8 million illnesses, 23,000 hospitalizations and 1,300 deaths from influenza as of November 5.
The flu is notoriously hard to predict.
“Among the people who study flu, there’s a little saying: ‘If you’ve seen one flu season, well, you’ve seen one flu season,’ ” said Dr. William Schaffner, a professor in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center and medical director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases. “The implication is that they’re all a little bit different from each other, and that’s certainly the case.”
This season, there have been about 5 flu hospitalizations for every 100,000 people, rates typically seen in December or January, CDC data shows. And in the most recent week, about 13% of lab tests – more than 1 in 8 – were positive for influenza, up from 9% the week before.
What you should know about getting a flu vaccine this year, according to an expert
Although the numbers are especially high for this time of year, experts say the trends are otherwise following an expected pattern, and the early arrival of flu season doesn’t necessarily mean it will last longer or be more severe.
“The picture is pretty consistent across our different pieces of surveillance. There’s nothing there that makes me think that this virus is really different and causing more severe disease than we see typically with flu,” said Lynnette Brammer, an epidemiologist who leads the CDC’s domestic influenza surveillance team. “Flu can cause severe outcomes, but it’s not out of proportion this year compared to previous years. It’s not like we’re seeing a lot of hospitalizations without a lot of illness.”
Flu activity has been highest in the South, CDC data shows. Data from Walgreens that tracks prescriptions for antiviral treatments such as Tamiflu suggests hotspots centered in Mississippi and Alabama, spreading from the Gulf Coast area, including Houston and New Orleans, up to Nashville.
As flu smolders in the South, RSV is showing early signs of slowing in the region, CDC data shows, even as it continues to ramp up in other parts of the country.
Nationwide, nearly 1 in 5 PCR tests for RSV were positive in the first week of November, reaching levels that the South saw a month ago. But in that region, fewer than 1 in 7 tests are now positive for RSV.
RSV is a common respiratory virus that can cause serious illness, especially in younger infants, and it’s kept pediatric hospitals more full than usual in recent weeks.
Opinion: The good and bad news on RSV, the newest viral villain in America
Despite the improvements in the South, overall burden on pediatric hospitals nationwide has not eased. More than three-quarters of pediatric hospital beds and pediatric ICU beds have been in use for the past few weeks – up from an average of about two-thirds full over the past two years, according to federal data.
On Thursday, Dr. Brian Cummings, medical director of the Department of Pediatrics at Mass General for Children, said they’ve seen around 2,000 cases of RSV in October, and more than 1,000 in the first week of November.
“It’s been escalating and been quite severe,” Cummings said during a news conference Thursday.
Most infections have been treated in urgent care facilities and in the emergency department, and people are sent home, Cummings said. “But even if just 10 percent of those need hospitalization, it creates a lot of stress on health care facilities, and so what we are seeing is we’ve had over 250 hospitalizations for RSV alone on top of the other circulating viruses,” he said.
The pediatric ICU is full, Cummings said, and seven patients are waiting to be transferred in.
Across the country, the threat of Covid-19, while significantly less than it was a year ago, remains.
Nearly 25,000 people were admitted to the hospital with Covid-19 in the first week of November, according to CDC data, a pace that’s forecast to hold steady for the next month, at least.

As multiple respiratory viruses continue to spread, experts emphasize the importance of vaccination, which is available for two of the three viruses in heavy circulation. But those numbers are lower than ideal.
One in 5 people still hasn’t gotten their first Covid-19 vaccine shot, CDC data shows, and less than 10% of the US population has gotten the updated Covid-19 booster.
And millions fewer flu vaccines have been distributed this season than at this point in previous years.
“You worry when you have an early season that people just haven’t had time to get vaccinated,” Brammer said. “But vaccine is the best tool that we have to prevent these severe outcomes.”

As major powers meet in Asia, the rest of the world is pressed to pick a side

 — 
World leaders are converging in Phnom Penh this weekend for the first in a series of international summits in Southeast Asia over the coming week, where divisions between major powers and conflict threaten to overshadow talks.
The first stop is the Cambodian capital where leaders from across the Indo-Pacific will meet alongside a summit of Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) leaders, followed next week by a meeting of the Group of 20 (G20) leaders in Bali and of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Bangkok.
The stacked diplomatic line-up will be a test of international appetite for coordination on issues like climate change, global inflation and rising food prices on the back of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and economic recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic – and the first time that all three events are being held in person since the outbreak began in 2020.
Sharp geopolitical divisions of the type not seen in decades loom over this political calendar, as the war in Ukraine has radically transformed Russia’s relationship with the West, the top two global economies US and China remain locked in intensifying competition, and the rest of the world is pressed to pick a side.
Whether Russian leader Vladimir Putin will make any appearance during the stretch of diplomatic dates remains uncertain. Both US President Joe Biden and Chinese leader Xi Jinping are expected to attend two of the summits in Southeast Asia – a region that has long been ground-zero for influence-jockeying between Beijing and Washington.
Biden lands in Cambodia to meet Asian allies ahead of Xi meeting
Xi is re-emerging on the world stage after years without travel during the pandemic, having secured a norm-breaking third term in power, while Biden heads east fresh from a better-than-expected performance by his party in the US midterm elections. Both would be expected to pitch their country as a stronger partner and more responsible global actor than the other.
The two will meet face-to-face on Monday on the sidelines of the G20, their first in-person encounter since Biden’s election, the White House said on Thursday. Beijing on Friday confirmed Xi’s travel plans to the G20 and APEC summits, and said he would hold bilateral meetings with Biden and several other leaders.
Talks between the two could help to avert an escalation of tensions between the powers. But for the leaders meeting during the string of summits in coming days, cinching robust agreements on tackling global issues – already a tough bargain at the best of times – will be a challenge.

Divided world
Even the most regional of the meetings, the ASEAN summit of Southeast Asian leaders – which kicked off in Phnom Penh on Friday and is slated to address strengthening regional stability as well as global challenges – will reflect fractured world politics, experts say.
But unlike the other major meetings, which may be more squarely focused on the fallout from the war in Ukraine, ASEAN leaders are entering the summit and related meetings this weekend under pressure to address a spiraling conflict within their own bloc: as Myanmar remains in turmoil and under military rule nearly two years after a brutal coup ousted the democratically elected government.
Differences between Southeast Asian countries on how to handle that conflict, compounded by their criss-crossing allegiances with great powers – and a reticence from the bloc to appear to take sides between the US and China – will all impact how much the group can agree on and what it can accomplish across the gamut of summits, experts say.
Biden to meet Xi on Monday for first high-stakes sit-down with Chinese leader
“Normally this season would be very exciting – you have three major world summits in Southeast Asia – Phnom Penh, Bali and Bangkok,” said Thitinan Pongsudhirak, director of the Institute of Security and International Studies at Chulalongkorn University’s Faculty of Political Science in Bangkok.
“But (ASEAN) is very much divided on Russian aggression, on the Myanmar coup crisis, on China’s belligerence in the South China Sea and so on, and this means that ASEAN is in bad shape,” he said.
At a United Nations vote last month, seven of the 10 ASEAN countries, including the Myanmar representative who is not backed by the ruling military, voted to condemn Russia’s annexation of four regions of Ukraine, while Thailand, Laos, and Vietnam abstained.
But ASEAN as a bloc has also taken a step to tighten ties with Kyiv at this week’s events, signing an amity and cooperation treaty with Ukraine in a ceremony with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba in Phnom Penh on Thursday.
The bloc aims to use consensus among its states as its strength when it brings larger world players to the table, for example in its adjacent East Asia Summit that brings together 18 Indo-Pacific countries, including Russia, China and the United States, and also meets this weekend.
“If ASEAN cannot get its house in order, if ASEAN cannot rein in a rogue member like the Myanmar military regime, then ASEAN loses its relevance,” Pongsudhirak said. “On the other hand, if ASEAN is united, if it can muster commitment and resolve … it can have a lot of pulling power.”
Conflict and competition in Southeast Asia
Nearly two years since the military coup crushed Myanmar’s fledgling democracy, rights groups and observers say freedoms and rights in the country have deteriorated sharply; state executions have returned and the number of documented violent attacks by the ruling military junta on civilian infrastructure, including schools, has surged.
Numerous armed rebel groups have emerged against the ruling military junta, while millions of people have resisted its rule through forms of civil disobedience.
The weekend’s summits in Phnom Penh will pull the conflict back into international focus, as Southeast Asian leaders try to find a path forward, after Myanmar’s ruling junta failed to implement a peace plan negotiated in April of last year. The country remains part of ASEAN, despite calls from rights groups for its ejection, but has been barred from sending political-level representatives to key events.

ASEAN foreign ministers held a last-ditch attempt to hash out a strategy late last month, with Cambodian Foreign Minister Prak Sokhonn, who chaired the meeting, stressing in a statement afterwards that the challenges were down to “the complexity and difficulty of Myanmar’s decades-long protracted conflicts, which has been further exacerbated by the current political crisis.”
But observers have low expectations for a tougher line, at least while Cambodia chairs the bloc, and are already looking to next year when Indonesia assumes leadership in 2023.
Addressing the “ongoing crisis” will be a focus for Biden in talks with Southeast Asian leaders as he attends ASEAN summits over the weekend, the White House said on Tuesday. Since the coup, the Biden administration has launched targeted sanctions against the military regime and held meetings with the opposition National Unity Government.
China, on the other hand, has shown support to the ruling military junta and would be unlikely to back tough action, observers say. A months-long inquiry into the situation in Myanmar released by an international team of lawmakers last month accused Russia and China of “supplying both weapons and legitimacy to an otherwise isolated regime.”
That, too, could have an impact on outcomes this weekend, according to political scientist Chong Ja Ian, an associate professor at the National University of Singapore.
“Because of Russian and (Chinese) support for the junta, any efforts toward a solution by ASEAN would require some form of engagement with them, whether this is to get buy-in or even just non-opposition,” Chong said.
The crisis in Myanmar is not the only area where US and China division may loom over the ASEAN summits, even as issues like China’s aggression in the South China Sea – where Beijing asserts territorial claims that conflict with those of several Southeast Asian countries – may be of lesser importance this year.
ASEAN will hold its usual side summits with both the US and China respectively, as well as other countries, and China’s number two leader, the economy-focused Premier Li Keqiang arrived earlier this week as Xi’s representative.
As Southeast Asian leaders seek to shore up their economic stability, they are likely to raise concerns about the impact of US-China competition on the region, its trade and supply chains, for example in the wake of a US export ban on semi-conductors to China, according to Chong.
“ASEAN states are going to try and find some way to navigate all this, and will be looking to both Beijing and Washington to see what sort of leeway they can provide,” he said.

Netanyahu to be invited to form government, paving way for return of Israel’s longest-serving leader
By Elliott Gotkine and Amir Tal, CNN

 — 
Israel’s President Isaac Herzog announced Friday he will invite Benjamin Netanyahu to form Israel’s next government, paving the way for him to take the country’s top job for a record sixth time and extend his record as the nation’s longest-serving leader.
Herzog will officially issue the mandate to Netanyahu on Sunday, he said. Herzog made the announcement after meeting with all the factions in parliament, the Knesset, to ask who they would back for prime minister.
In a statement released by his office, he said: “At the end of the round of consultations, 64 members of the Knesset recommended to the president the chairman of the Likud faction, MK Benjamin Netanyahu.” He added that 28 Knesset members recommended outgoing Prime Minister Yair Lapid. The same number chose not to recommend anyone.
Herzog will meet with Netanyahu at the president’s residence on Sunday to formally give him the mandate. Under Israeli law, Netanyahu will then have 28 days to form a new government, with the possibility of a 14-day extension if required.
During negotiations, Netanyahu will have to divide up ministries among his coalition partners and haggle over policies.
This is where things get interesting. With a four-seat majority in the 120-seat Knesset, or parliament, the five factions allied with Netanyahu’s Likud are all potential kingmakers: fail to give any one of them what they want, and they could bring the coalition down.
When it comes to the ultra-Orthodox parties, their demands are uncontroversial as far as Netanyahu is concerned: bigger budgets for religious schools, and the right not to teach their children secular subjects such as math and English.
The real showdowns are likely to come with his new extreme right-wing allies. Netanyahu rode to power on the back of a stunning showing by the Religious Zionism/Jewish Power list, which, with 14 seats, is now the third-biggest grouping in the Knesset. Its leader, Itamar Ben Gvir, who has a conviction for inciting anti-Arab racism and supporting terrorism, has demanded to be made Public Security Minister, in charge of Israel’s police.

Ben Gvir’s partner is Bezalel Smotrich, who has described himself as a “proud homophobe.” He has said Israel should be run according to Jewish law. He has spoken of reducing the power of the Supreme Court, and striking out the crime of breach of trust – which just so happens to be part of the indictments against Netanyahu in his ongoing corruption trials. Netanyahu has long denied all of the charges. If Smotrich wins the Justice Ministry he covets, he may be able to make these things happen, ending Netanyahu’s legal worries.
Yet these may be the least of his concerns. Having been forced to join forces with the extreme right wing, the sixth reign of Netanyahu may end up further alienating the half of Israel that didn’t vote for the bloc of parties backing him.
Restrictions on settlements in the occupied West Bank could be loosened, prompting international condemnation. Violence between Israelis and Palestinians in the West Bank could worsen; 2022 has already seen more people killed on each side than any time since 2015.
Then there’s the potentially explosive issue of the Jerusalem holy site known to Jews as the Temple Mount and to Muslims as the Ḥaram al-Sharīf, or Noble sanctuary.
Under the status quo, only Muslims are allowed to pray at the compound. Ben Gvir advocates allowing Jews to pray at what is their holiest site.
Any change could be used as a pretext by Palestinian militants to carry out attacks. It would almost certainly be condemned by Israel’s new friends in the Arab world, such as Morocco, the UAE and Bahrain.
A far-right surge is set to put Netanyahu back in power. Who are his extremist allies?
President Herzog himself summed up the issue when a hot mic caught him telling Netanyahu’s allies in the Shas party: “You’re going to have a problem with the Temple Mount. That’s a critical issue. You have a partner that the entire world is anxious about,” an apparent reference to Ben Gvir.
Herzog told another of Netanyahu’s allies, Avi Maoz of the avowedly anti-LGBT Noam faction: “There has been concern about things you have said about the LGBT community. All human beings were created in God’s image and we must respect everyone. We have only one State of Israel. That pertains also to your party.”
Could a Netanyahu-led government have disputes with the United States? Netanyahu may not have the same bromance with President Joe Biden as he did with Donald Trump, but the two men seem to get along.
“We are brothers,” Biden told Netanyahu in a call after the election. “My commitment to Israel is unquestionable. Congratulations, my friend.”
Netanyahu replied: “We will bring more historic peace agreements [with the Arab world], that is within reach. My commitment to our alliance and our relationship is stronger than ever.”
Netanyahu is vehemently against the US rejoining the Iran nuclear deal, but that seems off the table for now. On Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and Israel’s reluctance to provide Kyiv with defensive weapons, Netanyahu promised President Volodymyr Zelensky to “seriously examine” the issue.
Assuming Netanyahu can reach a coalition agreement by the December 11 deadline, the Knesset Speaker will call a confidence vote within seven days. If all goes to plan, Bibi’s government will then take office, perhaps on December 18 – in time for Hanukkah, the Jewish festival of lights (and miracles).

Kyiv, Ukraine
CNN
 — 
Ukrainian forces swept into the key city of Kherson on Friday as Russian troops retreated to the east, delivering a major victory to Kyiv and marking one of the biggest setbacks for President Vladimir Putin since his invasion began.
Elated civilians who had survived months of Russian occupation descended on Kherson’s central square, hugging newly arrived Ukrainian soldiers, snapping selfies with them, and waving Ukrainian flags.
Footage of the jubilant scenes emerged hours after Russia announced it had withdrawn from the west bank of the Dnipro River in the strategic southern region of Kherson, leaving the regional capital of Kherson and surrounding areas to the Ukrainians.
The retreat represents a major blow for Putin’s war effort in Ukraine. Kherson was the only Ukrainian regional capital that Russian forces had captured since February’s invasion. Their withdrawal east across the Dnipro cedes large swathes of land that Russia has occupied since the early days of the war, and that Putin had formally declared as Russian territory just five weeks ago.
“The Ukrainian flag is raised in Kherson city. From now on, the Ukrainian flag will appear on all buildings in Kherson. This is what we have dreamed of from the first days of occupation,” said Serhiy Khlan, a member of Ukraine’s Kherson regional council.
On Friday evening, Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky posted a night-time video of celebrations in Kherson city, where a crowd was waving flags and chanting “ZSU,” the Ukrainian acronym for the armed forces.
He called it “a historic day” for Ukraine. “We are returning the south of our country, we are returning Kherson.”
“As of now, our defenders are on the outskirts of the city. Just a little more to go and we will enter. But special units are already in the city,” Zelensky said.
Zelensky appealed to any Russian soldiers still on the west bank to surrender.
“We guarantee that you will be treated in accordance with the law and international standards. And to those Russian military who disguised themselves in civilian clothes and are hiding somewhere, I want to say that you cannot hide. We will find you anyway,” he said.
Ukrainian forces advanced through much of the Kherson region Friday, apparently encountering little or no resistance. Social media video from towns and villages throughout the region’s west bank shows troops being greeted by civilians.

Residents raised Ukrainian flags in Kherson city, which was occupied by Russia until Friday morning.

Russia’s Defense Ministry announced earlier on Friday that its forces have completed their partial withdrawal from the Kherson region, after Moscow ordered the retreat Wednesday,
“In the Kherson direction, the move of Russian military units to the left bank of the Dnieper River was completed at 0500 [Moscow time] this morning,” the ministry said on its official Telegram channel, using the Russian spelling for the river.
“Not a single piece of military equipment or weaponry was left behind on the right [west] bank,” the statement added. “All Russian servicemen have moved to the left bank of the Dnieper.”
Social media video suggests otherwise, with Russian tanks, armored vehicles and crates of ammunition displayed by Ukrainian troops.
Ukraine has asserted that it carried out attacks against Russian troop concentrations that were withdrawing, but the Russian Defense Ministry said in a statement later on Friday that “despite the attempts of the enemy to disrupt the transfer of Russian troops, no losses among personnel, weapons, military equipment and materiel were allowed.”
It also claimed that the Ukrainian advance had been held back for several days, and that “manpower and military equipment of the Armed Forces of Ukraine on the right bank of the Dnieper are being hit by fire.”
Ukraine has not reported any incoming fire from the east bank Friday but said a missile attack on the city of Mykolaiv, close to the border with Kherson, killed seven people early Friday.
Earlier Friday, the Ukrainian military’s southern operational command said Russian forces had been “urgently loading into boats that seem suitable for crossing and trying to escape” across the river.
It was unclear whether all Russian troops had left Kherson and the wider region; Khlan said the city was “almost under the control of the Armed Forces of Ukraine” but warned that some Russian troops may have remained behind in civilian clothing.
He cautioned that many Russian troops “threw away their military uniforms, and are now hiding with civilian clothes on.”
“They will be plotting provocations, false-flag operations in the city,” he said. “There is a lot of work ahead on demining and clearing the city.” Residents of Kherson city with whom CNN has spoken in recent weeks confirmed that many Russian soldiers were using civilian clothing.
Ukraine’s military said it would proceed cautiously through Kherson region, and warned Russian troops were mining roads and destroying critical infrastructure as they retreated from the region.
“The Russian invaders continue their looting of settlements from which they are retreating,” spokesman for the General Staff of Ukraine’s Armed Forces Oleksandr Shtupun said. “The enemy is also trying to damage power lines, other transport and critical infrastructure facilities of Kherson region.”
Images and video on social media Friday also showed that the Antonivskyi Bridge, the main conduit over the Dnipro in the Kherson region, had been destroyed.
At least seven bridges in total, four of them crossing the River Dnipro, have been destroyed in the last 24 hours, Maxar Technologies satellite images and other photos show.
Two bridges, a vehicle and a railroad, that sit atop a dam at Nova Kakhovka were among those destroyed.
Water is flowing out of three sluice gates at the critical dam, which spans the Dnipro river, according to satellite images from Maxar Technologies obtained by CNN.
It’s unclear how the latest damage, which is close to the west bank, was caused. Local Telegram channels reported Thursday night the sound of explosions around the dam. Ukrainian forces do not appear they have taken control of the dam, which could cause considerable damage in the region if breached.
Alexander Kots, a reporter for the Russian pro-government tabloid Komsomolskaya Pravda embedded with Russian forces, posted a video on his Telegram channel standing on the crossing, showing the entire center section of the bridge destroyed. “Behind me are the two collapsed spans of (the) bridge,” Kots said. “They were likely blown up during the withdrawal of the Russian group of forces from the right bank to the left,” or western bank to eastern bank.
The entire center section of the bridge appears to have been destroyed.
Twitter
Sweeping losses
Russian forces have ceded about 40% of the Kherson region, which straddles the Dnipro, within a few days.
Now that Ukrainian forces have recaptured Kherson as far as the Dnipro river, the two sides face each other across the river over a distance of some 250 kilometers – from the area around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant to the edge of the Black Sea.
As Russian forces have fled, Ukrainian troops have pushed forward in their wake, capturing dozens of villages and settlements in Kherson region above the Dnipro.
The Ukrainian military on Friday recaptured another part of Kherson region, the village of Tyahinka near the strategic town of Nova Kakhovka, despite Russian forces destroying bridges to the village.
A video circulating on social media on Friday, geolocated and authenticated by CNN, showed Ukrainian forces being greeted by residents on the main highway in Tyahinka. The village is just 14 miles (20 km) west of the hydroelectric dam and bridges that stretch across the Dnipro river at Nova Kakhovka.
A number of photos, also geolocated and authenticated by CNN, show that the Ukrainian forces were able to make their way into the village despite the main highway’s bridge and a pedestrian bridge being destroyed by the Russians as they withdrew. Dozens of bridges across the Kherson region have been destroyed or disabled during the conflict.
Residents of the town of Bilozerka, on the western outskirts of Kherson city, raised a Ukrainian flag and ripped down Russian propaganda billboards on Friday, according to videos on social media geolocated by CNN.
One video showed a Ukrainian flag flying over a World War II memorial, while another showed residents tearing down a propaganda billboards with a young girl holding a Russian flag, which read: “Russia is here forever.”
The scenes of people greeting Ukrainian troops across the region were in sharp contrast to claims by Russian-appointed officials in Kherson six weeks ago that 87% of voters there supported integration into the Russian Federation, in a referendum widely condemned by the international community as a sham. Kherson was one of four Ukrainian regions illegally annexed by Russia in September.
Ukraine claims big gains in south, but fears retreating Russians will turn Kherson into 'city of death'
Kyiv officials had warned that retreating Russian troops could turn the regional capital of Kherson into a “city of death” on the way out, and an official in southern Ukraine warned residents Friday to be wary of quickly returning to recently liberated territory due to the threat of mines.
“There are a lot of mines in the liberated territories and settlements,” Vitaliy Kim, head of Mykolaiv region military administration, said on Telegram. “Don’t go there for no reason. There are casualties.”
Putin’s spokesperson on Friday insisted that the region remains part of Russia, despite the Russian withdrawal.
“This is a subject of the Russian Federation,” Dmitry Peskov said during a regular briefing with journalists. “It has been legally fixed and defined. There can be no changes here.”
Russia still controls a large portion of the Kherson region – the area east of the Dnipro River.
When asked directly whether Russia’s retreat was “humiliating” for President Vladimir Putin, Peskov replied: “No.”

Magic wall: John King breaks down latest Nevada Senate numbers02:38
Nov. 11, 2022 US election coverage
By Adrienne Vogt, Matt Meyer, Elise Hammond, Tara Subramaniam and Seán Federico O'Murchú, CNN
Updated 10:07 a.m. ET, November 12, 2022
What we covered here
Win in Arizona: Democrats are one seat away from Senate control after CNN projects incumbent Mark Kelly will win the Arizona Senate race.
All eyes on Nevada: The Senate race in Nevada has tightened to around 800 votes, with about 56,000 ballots still to count, according to the latest tallies. GOP candidate, Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo, won the governor's race.
Runoff next month: Georgia's Senate contest is headed to a Dec. 6 runoff.
Where things stand in House races: Republicans appear to be slowly inching closer to the 218 seats that would deliver them a House majority, but several congressional races — including in California and Colorado — remain uncalled.

Maricopa County elections official pushes back on allegations of misconduct in vote counting
From CNN's Tara Subramaniam

The chairman of the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors Bill Gates pushed back on allegations of misconduct from Arizona Republican senatorial candidate Blake Masters, the Republican National Committee, and the Republican State Party of Arizona on Friday night.
""The suggestion by the Republican National Committee that there is something untoward going on here in Maricopa County is absolutely false and again, is offensive to these good elections workers,” he said.
On Friday night the RNC and the Republican Party of Arizona tweeted a statement criticizing the process in Maricopa County, and demanding that the county require ""around-the-clock shifts of ballot processing"" until all of the votes are counted.
Addressing the specific accusations from the RNC statement, Gates said “I would prefer that if there are concerns that they have, that they communicate those to us here. I'm a Republican. Three of my colleagues on the board are Republicans. Raise these issues with us and discuss them with us, as opposed to making these baseless claims.”
“Let the count continue on and at the end, if they have issues they choose to take to court, they have every right to do that, and we’ll let that process play through.” Gates added. 
Responding to claims that the count is “taking too long,” Gates said the county’s pace is in line with previous years. 
Tabulation concerns: Gates also responded to an assertion from Masters that the county had mixed up uncounted ballots with counted ballots and should ""wipe the slate clean"" and start counting all over again. 
In an interview Friday with Fox News's Tucker Carlson, Masters said that on ""at least two occasions,"" the county mixed up uncounted ballots placed in a secure drop box after they were not able to be processed on-site because of technical glitches, with ballots that had already been counted.
Gates said that there were two vote centers where ballots ""co-mingled"" -– but said that the county has a process to separate them out. 
And addressing the suggestion from Masters that the county should wipe the slate clean and start counting over again, Gates said that “is simply not allowed for under Arizona law.”
The voting tabulator glitches in Maricopa County on Election Day have become fodder for right-wing conspiracy theories. 
CNN projected Friday night that Arizona Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly would hold his seat.

Analysis: Democrats defied the odds but Biden still faces challenges
Democrats did better than the historical average in this midterm election, CNN's John King said Friday night.
But even so, if Democrats hold the Senate while Republicans control the House, it will be complicated for President Joe Biden to advance his agenda, King says.
CNN has not yet projected who will win control of the Senate or the House.
Watch below for CNN's John King's analysis:
10:36 p.m. ET, November 11, 2022
CNN Projection: Democrat Adrian Fontes will defeat election denier Mark Finchem in Arizona secretary of state race
From CNN staff

Democrat Adrian Fontes will win Arizona’s secretary of state race, CNN projects, and defeat Republican state Rep. Mark Finchem.
Finchem is one of Arizona’s most strident backers of former President Donald Trump’s lies about the 2020 election. Finchem, a self-proclaimed member of the far-right extremist group the Oath Keepers, has called the 2020 election “irredeemably compromised,” co-sponsored a bill that would’ve allowed the legislature to reject election results and attended Trump’s speech on Jan. 6 (but he’s denied he participated in the riot).
Fontes had called Finchem’s ideas “dangerous” and shortly after announcing his campaign called the state representative a “traitor clown.”
Arizona’s secretary of state serves as next in line to the governor, as the state doesn’t have a lieutenant governor.
The race had been one of the most closely watched contests for state election chief in the country, and national Democratic groups spent heavily to keep the open seat in their party’s column – as Finchem outraised Fontes. 
The current officeholder, Democrat Katie Hobbs, ran for Arizona governor this year. 
Fontes oversaw the 2020 election in Maricopa County, home to Phoenix. But he lost his reelection bid as county recorder that year after facing criticism for some of the changes he made to the county’s procedures during the pandemic. 
11:26 p.m. ET, November 11, 2022
Arizona Democrat gubernatorial candidate Katie Hobbs extends lead after latest Maricopa County results
From CNN's Tara Subramaniam

The latest results from Maricopa County are “not what the Republicans needed,” CNN’s John King said Friday night.
Shortly after the new batch was released, CNN projected that Democratic incumbent Mark Kelly will win against Republican Blake Masters.
“When the new votes come in, you have to meet your target because every time new votes come in, there’s a smaller pool left to count. So you need to meet or exceed your target if you’re the trailing candidate,” King said.
In Maricopa County, Arizona's most populated, Democrat Katie Hobbs now has 667,833 votes to Republican Kari Lake’s 607,359 votes.
Lake’s vote count is competitive, King said. “But if you’re trailing you need a bigger percentage than that.”
After the latest batch of Maricopa County votes, Hobbs has increased her lead state-wide, King noted.
But as more vote counts are released, it’s still mathematically possible for Lake to make up the difference, he said.
10:32 p.m. ET, November 11, 2022
CNN Projection: Incumbent Democrat Mark Kelly wins Arizona Senate race
From CNN's Maeve Reston
(Mark Kelly/Handout/Reuters)
Arizona Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly will win a full six-year term, CNN projects, defeating Republican Blake Masters, a venture capitalist who was backed by former President Donald Trump and had repeated some of his falsehoods about the 2020 election. 
The win by Kelly, who was elected in 2020 to fill the term of the late GOP Sen. John McCain, is a critical victory that edges Democrats one step closer to their goal of maintaining control of the US Senate – which would be a stunning feat given the low approval ratings of President Joe Biden and the unfavorable economic climate that seemed to be driving momentum toward the GOP. 
With Kelly’s win in Arizona, Democrats will hold 49 seats and Republicans will hold 49. With the Arizona seat in their column, Democrats would need to notch just one more seat to hold the majority in the upper chamber, following their pickup in Pennsylvania where Lt. Gov. John Fetterman, a Democrat, defeated Trump-backed Mehmet Oz in the contest to replace retiring Republican Sen. Pat Toomey. (The Senate is currently divided 50-50, but Vice President Kamala Harris casts the tie breaking vote). 
Both parties are still eyeing an incredibly close race in Nevada where Democrat Catherine Cortez Masto is trying to fend off a challenge from Republican Adam Laxalt, the state’s former attorney general. Democrats are also defending a seat in Georgia, where Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock and Republican Herschel Walker are headed to a December 6 runoff, CNN projects. 
Control of the US House still hangs in the balance, but it is clear that even if Republicans win a majority, it will be a far more slender advantage than GOP leaders had hoped. 
Kelly entered the 2022 cycle well positioned to withstand the headwinds facing Democrats -- even in a purple state like Arizona that Joe Biden narrowly won -- because of his formidable fundraising and unique personal brand as a retired astronaut, a Navy veteran and the husband of former Rep. Gabby Giffords. 
As the votes were counted in Arizona, Masters’ campaign team had hoped that an unusually large tranche of mail-in ballots that were dropped off at polling locations on Election Day would favor Republicans. Those ballots in Maricopa County, the state’s most populous, took longer to count than those cast in person on Tuesday because officials had to verify signatures on the ballot envelopes. 
In a call with reporters on Friday afternoon, Masters campaign advisers argued that Masters had a path to victory. “We always knew it was going to be a close race,” one campaign officials said. “Smart observers looking at this race know it is entirely too close to call. It’s probably going to come down to 10,000 votes either way. And we feel good, we have a path.” 
But ultimately as the tallies continued, Kelly opened a lead that Masters could not overcome. 
Earlier in the race, Masters, a first-time candidate, was able to navigate the GOP primary gauntlet with significant financial backing from conservative tech billionaire Peter Thiel, his former boss. He appealed to Republicans by promising to prioritize immigration issues, but also by echoing Trump’s lies about the 2020 election. In one campaign video released last year, he said he believed Trump won. 
Masters then appeared to modulate his tone about the 2020 election results as well as the conservative stances he had sought out during the primary on abortion – in what initially seemed like an effort to appeal to broader swath of the Arizona electorate. (Though Republicans comprise a plurality in Arizona, independents make up about a third of the electorate and often sway close elections). 
After his primary victory in August, Masters scrubbed his website of language that included the false claim that the election was stolen. Under questioning from the moderator during a debate with Kelly, Masters conceded that he had not seen evidence of fraud in the 2020 vote counting or election results in a way that would have changed the outcome. In that debate and on the trail, Kelly had argued that the “wheels” could “come off our democracy” if election deniers like Masters were elected. 
But Masters seemed to reverse course after receiving a phone call from Trump urging him to “go stronger” on election denialism, a conversation that was captured in a Fox documentary. In the final week of the campaign, Masters told CNN’s Kyung Lah he didn’t believe moderates were bothered by his comments about the 2020 election, insisting that voters were far more focused on their concerns about inflation, crime and the border. 
Throughout the campaign, Kelly portrayed Masters as an extremist, who would jeopardize abortion rights, as well as Social Security and Medicare. In a state where lawmakers passed a new ban on abortion at 15 weeks earlier this year – and where there are legal efforts underway to ban abortion in almost all cases – Kelly’s campaign kept a relentless focus on Masters’ anti-abortion stances. 
Masters had said he would support a national ban on abortion after 15 weeks, a proposal that was advanced by South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham. That bill includes exceptions for rape, incest and to protect the life of the mother. 
CNN analysts break down the latest numbers:

CNN Projection: Republican Joe Lombardo will defeat Democratic Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak
From CNN's Maeve Reston

Republican Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo will defeat Democratic Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak, CNN projects.
Sisolak issued a statement conceding the race.
""While votes are still coming in – and we need every ballot tallied and every voice heard – it appears we will fall a percentage point or so short of winning,"" Sisolak said. ""Obviously that is not the outcome I want, but I believe in our election system, in democracy and honoring the will of Nevada voters.""
In his concession statement, Sisolak also voiced his support for fellow Democrat Catherine Cortez-Masto, who is locked in a tight race against Republican candidate Adam Laxalt.
Nevada has been a battleground state since the early 1990s, but Joe Biden narrowly clinched victory in the Silver State in 2020 despite a significant effort by Donald Trump, particularly in Nevada’s rural areas. Democrats have made gains in competitive races in recent years by relying, in part, on turning out working-class voters and Latinos, two key constituencies in a state that is heavily reliant on tourism as well as the hospitality and service industries. 
But those two voter blocs were among the hardest hit by the economic downturn during the pandemic, which sent unemployment in Nevada soaring to 30% in April of 2020 – the highest in the nation and more than twice the US unemployment rate at that time. The state’s workers then faced a double hit as inflation rose and gas prices topped $5 a gallon in a state where many people must drive long distances to work. 
That created an especially sour mood among voters as Sisolak embarked on his reelection campaign. Though the Democratic governor touted the recovery in the state’s labor market, Lombardo argued that Sisolak was painting a distorted picture of Nevadans’ economic struggles, because many Nevadans are still underemployed, he said. Lombardo also accused Sisolak of crushing businesses in the state with Covid-19 restrictions and onerous regulations. He said Sisolak was too slow to reopen schools and businesses, slowing the state’s recovery. But the Democratic governor pushed back by stating his primary focus was to “save lives.” 
Lombardo was one of the rare GOP candidates backed by both Trump and the Republican establishment. During the general election, he, at times, sought to keep his distance from Trump as he tried to win over moderate and independent voters. During a debate with Sisolak, Lombardo said he wouldn’t describe Trump as a “great” president and said he did not agree with Trump’s false assertions that the 2020 presidential election was rigged. 
But Sisolak suggested that Lombardo was giving different answers to different audiences. He also relentlessly attacked Lombardo’s shifts on abortion, which is protected in Nevada up to 24 weeks by a 1990 voter referendum. Lombardo argued that Nevada’s current law should stay in place, but Sisolak noted that he had changed his position several times during the course of the campaign. In May, for example, Lombardo told a columnist he would support sending voters a referendum moving the 24-week limit to 13 weeks. But he later said he had thought more about that potential change and no longer supported it. Still, Sisolak portrayed his Republican opponent as a threat to women’s reproductive rights. 
Sisolak did not invite Biden to campaign with him in the final stretch, but he also argued the president was being unfairly blamed for inflation, as well as problems that he inherited from Trump.

 — 
Four Supreme Court justices who voted to strike down Roe v. Wade joined the Federalist Society Thursday night as the conservative legal group celebrated its 40th anniversary and resoundingly applauded the high court’s June decision.
Justice Samuel Alito, who penned the court’s majority decision that overturned Roe, did not directly address the ruling during his remarks at the black-tie dinner in Washington, DC. But he received a standing ovation from the audience when former Michigan Supreme Court Chief Justice Stephen Markman invoked the decision.
“You know, I’ve heard it said by some in recent months that the Dobbs decision will be forever an indelible part of Justice Alito’s legacy,” Markman said.
Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh were also in attendance, as was Justice Amy Coney Barrett, who also delivered remarks during the dinner, which the group hosted in celebration of its longevity and in honor of the late conservative Justice Antonin Scalia. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell was also in attendance.

The Federalist Society was founded in 1982 by conservative students and professors, some of whom believed in originalism, a philosophy tied to the framers’ view of the Constitution in the 18th century. The group’s imprint on the Supreme Court is significant and arguably unrivaled: Every one of the current Republican appointees, including Chief Justice John Roberts, was vetted in some way by the Federalist Society working with the respective GOP administrations. The three Trump appointees were more directly hand-picked by Federalist Society stalwarts.
For his part, McConnell, when he was the Senate majority leader, was a crucial partner to the Federalist Society in choosing judicial candidates and getting them confirmed, particularly during the Trump administration.
Alito spoke fondly of the legal group during Thursday’s dinner, remembering time spent having meals with the Federalist Society’s DC chapter at a Chinese restaurant in the city. He brought with him a fortune cookie he said he kept from that very restaurant.
“I’m going to open it and read the fortune. I hope it will tell us something about, I hope it will foretell the future of the Federalist Society,” Alito said, before reading from the fortune: “‘You will flourish, grow and travel to all parts of the country. You will spread wisdom and civility and will live as long as your work is needed.’”
Barrett, like Alito, received a standing ovation as she took the stage, using the moment to highlight the opposition she has faced in recent months.
“It’s really nice to have a lot of noise made not by protesters outside of my house,” she said.
She went on to discuss her own connection to the group, which she joined while she was a law professor at Notre Dame Law School.
“I have benefited immensely by the efforts of those who put in so much work at the beginning, including my dear Judge Silberman,” Barrett said, referring to the federal judge for whom she clerked following law school.

Filmmaker Paul Haggis is ordered to pay at least $7.5 million after being found liable in a sexual assault case involving a former publicist
By Amy Simonson, CNN

CNN
 — 
A jury found filmmaker Paul Haggis liable in a sexual assault case that was brought forward by a former publicist who alleged he raped her after a movie premiere in 2013.
The jury ordered the Oscar-winning screenwriter to pay Haleigh Breest at least $7.5 million in damages Thursday, according to attorneys for both Breest and Haggis.
Breest brought the case under the New York City Victims of Gender-Motivated Violence Protection Act.
Attorney Ilann Maazel, who represents Breest, told CNN by phone, “We’re grateful. We’re thankful. The jury was methodical and did justice today. We are proud, not just for Haleigh but for the entire #MeToo movement.”
In a statement to CNN, Haggis’s attorney, Priya Chaudhry said, “We are disappointed and shocked by this verdict.”
“It was impossible for Mr. Haggis to get a fair trial once the judge allowed the statements of 4 other women who never went to the police, never took any action against him, and 3 of 4 never even came into the courtroom,” the attorney added. “They used this to distort the truth, assassinate Mr. Haggis’ character, paint him as a monster, and use a ‘where there’s smoke, there’s fire’ strategy. No one could have had a fair trial in that courtroom under those circumstances. This is a shameful exploitation of the #MeToo movement where political sentiment trumps facts.”
Breest alleged that Haggis sexually assaulted her on the evening of January 31, 2013, in his Manhattan apartment when she was 26 years old – “less than half Mr. Haggis’s age,” according to the complaint filed in the state Supreme Court’s branch in New York County in 2017.
“The emotional and psychological damage to Ms. Breest from the attack cannot be overstated: it has been profound and lasting,” the complaint said.
The incident occurred after Haggis and Breest were at a movie premiere, according to the complaint. Toward the end of the event, Haggis offered Breest a ride home, the complaint alleges.
Once in his vehicle, Haggis invited Breest over for a drink.
“Ms. Breest told him she was willing to go to a public bar, but stated she did not want to go to his apartment. Mr. Haggis insisted they go to his apartment,” the complaint said.
Breest “relented” after being “faced with his persistence” and after recognizing that he was a “powerful member of the Hollywood elite who could influence her career,” according to the complaint.
The complaint alleges that Haggis made unwanted sexual advances and forcibly kissed her.
“She repeatedly told him ‘No’ but he would not stop,” the complaint said.
Haggis got Breest into the bedroom where he forced himself on her and ultimately raped her despite her efforts to push him off, the complaint alleges.
Maazel told CNN that the punitive damage trial will likely continue Monday where he expects Haggis to take the stand.
Haggis is a director, producer and screenwriter. His film credits include “Crash,” which earned him Oscars for best picture and best original screenplay at the 2006 Academy Awards. He also received a nomination for his screenplay for the multi-Oscar-winning “Million Dollar Baby.”
The filmmaker was detained in Italy over sexual assault allegations earlier this year while he was there to attend a film festival. An attorney for Haggis denied the allegations.

Police inspector being investigated over Seoul’s Halloween crush found dead

 — 
A senior South Korean police inspector who was being investigated in connection with the deadly Halloween crowd crush in Seoul has been found dead in his home.
The inspector was found lifeless by his family at around 12:45pm on Friday, according to South Korean police.
The police said they are investigating the circumstances.
The news comes after investigators raided the offices of the Yongsan district police station, which oversees the nightlife neighborhood of Itaewon, where the crush took place.
In what was one of the country’s worst disasters, 158 people died after tens of thousands of costumed partygoers celebrating Halloween poured into the popular nightlife district, many of them becoming trapped as the narrow streets clogged up.
Public anger over the disaster has mounted since it emerged that hours before the tragedy members of the public had phoned the police to warn of overcrowding problems.
Korean authorities have also come under fire after witnesses said there were little to no crowd control measures in place in Itaewon on the night of the crush – despite police receiving warnings far in advance.
Last week, the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency said investigators raided eight of its offices and seized documents relating to reports made by members of the public to the 112 emergency hotline.
The raids were carried out by a special investigative unit created by the National Police Agency (NPA) to look into the disaster. The NPA said last week it had suspended the chief of the Yongsan police station, one of the police stations closest to the crush site.
Records given to CNN by the NPA show police received at least 11 calls from people in Itaewon concerned about the possibility of a crowd crush as early as four hours before the incident occurred.
The first call came at 6:34 p.m., when a caller warned, “It looks really dangerous … I fear people might get crushed.”
Another caller less than two hours later said there were so many people packed into Itaewon’s narrow alleys that they kept falling over and getting hurt.
Speaking to the media last week, NPA chief Yoon Hee-keun admitted for the first time that police had made mistakes in their response.
He added that the police response to the emergency calls had been “inadequate,” and that he felt a “heavy responsibility” as the agency head.
This story has been updated with the latest death toll in the disaster.

China scraps Covid flight bans, cuts quarantine for inbound travelers

CNN Business
 — 
China has reduced the amount of time travelers entering the country must spend in quarantine and removed a major restriction on international flights, in a sign of a limited easing of its stringent zero-Covid policy.
The new measures were announced Friday following a meeting by the ruling Communist Party’s top decision-making body, during which leaders vowed to maintain Covid protocols while stressing the need to minimize economic and social disruptions.
The long-awaited announcement, however, does not explicitly mention when the changes will take effect.
China is the last major economy to adhere to a zero-Covid policy, using snap lockdowns, mass testing, extensive contact-tracing and quarantines to stamp out infections as soon as they emerge.
The zero-tolerance approach has faced increasing challenges from highly transmissible new variants, and its heavy economic and social costs have drawn mounting public backlash.
The easing of the measures will see authorities scrap the so-called “circuit breaker” mechanism, under which China-bound flights were suspended if an airline was found to carry a certain number of passengers who tested positive for Covid upon landing.
Inbound international passengers will also see their pre-departure test requirement reduced from two to one, and their mandatory centralized quarantine upon arrival cut from seven days to five days, followed by another three days of home isolation.
International travelers who do not have a permanent address in China will still need to do a total of eight days of quarantine in hotels.
Markets responded positively to the changes as Covid-19 restrictions have kept international investors jittery. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index shot up 7% just after the noon break local time, while mainland China’s benchmark Shanghai Composite Index rose 2.5%.
Under the new guidelines, people who are identified as close contacts of Covid-19 cases will also have shortened quarantine at centralized government-operated facilities, down from seven days plus another three days at home, to five days and three days at home.
In addition, government health officials are no longer required to report secondary close contacts in many circumstances.

Kentucky unveils statue of Nettie Depp, the first woman to have a permanent large-scale monument inside the state Capitol
By Aya Elamroussi and Amy Simonson, CNN
Updated 12:03 AM EST, Fri November 11, 2022
State officials gather at the Kentucky state Capitol on Thursday to unveil the first permanent monument of a woman.
Kentucky Governor's office
CNN
 — 
Kentucky state officials on Thursday unveiled a sculpture of public education trailblazer Nettie Depp, the first woman from the state to have a large-scale monument dedicated to her inside the state Capitol.
“Nettie Depp was a pioneer in the field of public education in Kentucky, serving as an elected school superintendent in Barren County seven years before women were given the right to vote,” Gov. Andy Beshear said in a news release.
The unveiling of the nearly 7-foot-tall bronze statue of Depp on Thursday at the statehouse drew the governor, the first lady and Lt. Gov. Jacqueline Coleman as well as members of the Monumental Women of Kentucky Committee.
“We join each other to celebrate a long-awaited and much-needed change in our Capitol,” Beshear said.

During the early 1900s, Depp advocated for fair pay for teachers and public education. Her work led her to become the first woman elected to public office in Barren County as superintendent of schools in 1913. Depp died from breast cancer in 1932 when she was 57.
“Depp is worthy of the pedestal upon which she literally has been placed, but she also symbolizes the significant contribution of so many other important women in Kentucky’s history,” Beshear said. “She is a distinguished Kentucky public figure, and we are proud to honor her with the first monument of a Kentucky woman installed in the statehouse.”
First Lady Britainy Beshear pointed out that for too long thousands of people have visited the capitol and have seen statues that have represented Kentucky history.
“But never was one a woman,” she said. “We correct this today. … Her presence in the capitol is significant, not only for what she accomplished in her lifetime but what she represents for all of Kentucky’s women who have come after her, standing on her shoulders to become the women they want to be, not the women they were told they could only be.”
The development of the statue has been underway since 2014, and the installation was approved in 2017 by the Historic Properties Advisory Commission. The statue was sculpted by artist Amanda Matthews from Lexington, Kentucky.
“My hope is that this sculpture not only honors Depp, but serves as a proxy for other unsung Kentucky heroes who dedicate their lives to their communities in service to others,” Matthews said in the news release.

New York Times: NBA commissioner Adam Silver says he doesn’t believe Kyrie Irving is antisemitic
By Jacob Lev, CNN

 — 
NBA commissioner Adam Silver believes that suspended Brooklyn Nets guard Kyrie Irving is not antisemitic following a meeting between the two earlier in the week, the commissioner told the New York Times.
Silver, who is Jewish, told the Times that the two had “a direct and candid conversation” at the league’s headquarters in New York.
“He’s someone I’ve known for a decade, and I’ve never heard an antisemitic word from him or, frankly, hate directed at any group,” Silver said.

In a follow-up call with the newspaper, Silver added, “Whether or not he is antisemitic is not relevant to the damage caused by the posting of hateful content.”
The Nets suspended Irving last week after he doubled down on his decision to share an Amazon link to an antisemitic documentary to his millions of social media followers. The 30-year-old NBA star apologized on his Instagram account after his suspension was announced.
While the NBA did not hand down its own suspension to Irving, Silver said the punishment “got to the right outcome,” acknowledging the criticism the league faced for not suspending Irving sooner.

“And in retrospect, we may have been able to get there faster,” Silver said. “I accept that criticism. But I felt it was important to understand the context in which it was posted to understand what discipline was appropriate, not in any way to excuse it but to understand what discipline was appropriate.”
Silver told the Times he has watched the film and concluded that it “was indeed hate speech.”
The NBA commissioner made his first public appearance since the controversy at a conference in Washington, DC, on Thursday and addressed the situation, the Times reported. Silver told the audience that Amazon bore some of the responsibility for having the film on its platform.
CNN has reached out to Amazon for comment but did not immediately hear back.

In response to the controversy, the Nets had suspended Irving for a minimum of five games. He has missed four games so far, making him eligible to play against the Los Angeles Lakers on Sunday.
Silver said the Nets along with the league will consult to decide when Irving can return from suspension.
In addition to the suspension, Irving is required to complete other steps to return to the court.
LeBron James says Kyrie Irving 'caused some harm to a lot of people'
Brooklyn Nets general manager Sean Marks said previously that Irving would need to pass “some remedial steps and measures” for the star to rejoin the team.
Marks said in part, “(Steps) have been put in place for him to obviously seek some counseling … from dealing with some anti-hate and some Jewish leaders within our community. He’s going to have to sit down with them, he’s going to have to sit down with the organization after this, and we’ll evaluate and see if this is the right opportunity to bring him back.”
Further, the Nets reportedly outlined “six-action items” he must complete in order to return to the team, according to the Athletic, citing unnamed league sources.
The six steps are: Irving must apologize and condemn the film he promoted, make a $500,000 donation to anti-hate causes, complete sensitivity training, as well as anti-Semitism training, meet with the ADL and Jewish leaders and meet with team owner Joe Tsai “to demonstrate an understanding of the situation.”
Irving has run into controversy in recent years that has affected his playing time. Last season, Irving did not play in many of Brooklyn’s home games because he was not vaccinated against Covid-19, which was a hindrance to playing in indoor arenas due to a New York City workplace vaccine mandate. The rule was later lifted and he returned to Barclays Center in March.
